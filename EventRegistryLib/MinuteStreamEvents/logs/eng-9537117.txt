Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges and taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into ties between American business leaders and the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, Cuellar and his wife accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico, and in exchange, Cuellar agreed to advance the interests of the country and the bank in the U.S., according to the indictment.\n\nAmong other things, Cuellar agreed to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House, the indictment states.\n\nThe Department of Justice said the couple surrendered to authorities on Friday and were taken into custody.\n\nThe longtime congressman released a statement Friday saying he and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nNeither Cuellar nor his attorney immediately responded to calls seeking comment on the matter.\n\nThe payments to the couple went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a \"sham contract,\" purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment states.\n\nImelda Cuellar sent a falsified invoice to the Azerbaijan energy company's Washington, D.C., office under the agreement, stating her work was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imedla Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation. That search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington, D.C., and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nFederal disclosures show that the nine-term congressman traveled to Azerbaijan in 2013. Two years later, Cuellar's office announced an agreement between a Texas university and an organization called the Assembly of Friends of Azerbaijan for the purposes of collaborating on oil and gas research and education.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges and taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, Cuellar, 68, and his wife accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico, and in exchange, Cuellar agreed to advance the interests of the country and the bank in the U.S., according to the indictment.\n\nAmong other things, Cuellar agreed to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House, the indictment states.\n\nThe Department of Justice said the couple surrendered to authorities on Friday and were taken into custody. They made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nThe longtime congressman released a statement Friday saying he and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, 67, \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nNeither Cuellar nor his attorney immediately responded to calls seeking comment on the matter.\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they face up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a \"sham contract,\" purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment states.\n\nImelda Cuellar sent a falsified invoice to the Azerbaijan energy company's Washington, D.C., office under the agreement, stating her work was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imelda Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nThe indictment also alleges an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as \"el Jefe\" or \"boss,\" and also that a member of Cuellar's staff sent multiple emails to officials at the Department of State pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation.

Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife have been indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges in connection with a federal probe into the ties of American business leaders with Azerbaijan\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into ties between American business leaders and the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, Cuellar and his wife accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico, and in exchange, Cuellar agreed to advance the interests of the country and the bank in the U.S., according to the indictments.\n\nAmong other things, Cuellar agreed to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House, the indictment states.\n\nThe longtime congressman released a statement Friday saying he and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nNeither Cuellar nor his attorney immediately responded to calls seeking comment on the matter. Officials with the U.S. Department of Justice declined to discuss the matter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation. That search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington, D.C., and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nFederal disclosures show that the nine-term congressman traveled to Azerbaijan in 2013. Two years later, Cuellar's office announced an agreement between a Texas university and an organization called the Assembly of Friends of Azerbaijan for the purposes of collaborating on oil and gas research and education.\n\nCuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022.e

Henry Cuellar and wife indicted on bribery and foreign influence chargesDaniel Barnes and Julie Tsirkin and Ryan Nobles and Rebecca Kaplan and Ken Dilanian and Scott WongMay 3, 2024 at 8:21 PM\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Friday released an indictment against longtime Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, and his wife, Imelda, charging the pair with bribery and money laundering related to their ties with an oil and gas company controlled by Azerbaijan and a bank in Mexico City.\n\nNBC News was first to report that the charges were coming.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo, Texas, were raided in January 2022 as part of a federal investigation into Azerbaijan and a group of U.S. businessmen who have ties to the country, law enforcement said at the time. His office had pledged to cooperate with the investigation. In April, Cuellar's lawyer, Joshua Berman, told some news outlets that federal authorities informed him he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar is a one-time co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if the indictment was related to the 2022 raid. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nCuellar's staff were calling other member offices Friday seeking advice on how to handle the situation, one source with knowledge of those calls told NBC News.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Cuellar denied any wrongdoing, saying that he had \"proactively sought legal advice\" from the House Ethics Committee, which had issued \"more than one written opinion\" about the matter. Much of his statement focused on his wife, Imelda Cuellar, though it wasn't immediately clear why.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said in his statement, later adding: \"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people ...\"\n\n\"Imelda and I have been married for 32 years. On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working with banking, tax, and consulting,\" he continued. \"The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive.\"\n\nA defiant Cuellar also made clear he will seek re-election: \"Let me be clear, I'm running for re-election and will win this November.\"\n\nA year after the raid on his home -- which has not previously yielded arrests or charges -- Cuellar told the Texas Tribune: \"There has been no wrongdoing on my part. ... My focus remains the same from my very first day in office: delivering results for Texans across my district.\"\n\nDespite the raid, Cuellar narrowly defeated a progressive challenger, Jessica Cisneros, in his 2022 primary and went on to win re-election to his seat that November. He didn't face a primary challenger this year and will be on the ballot this November seeking his 11th term in Congress.\n\nTwo years ago, Cuellar easily defeated Republican nominee Cassy Garcia, 57% to 43%. His district became bluer when he picked up parts of San Antonio following redistricting. But the indictment will make Cuellar more vulnerable than in the past; in 2020, Joe Biden won Cuellar's district over Donald Trump by 7 percentage points.\n\nTwo Republicans will face each other in a runoff election in late May for a chance to take on Cuellar in the fall.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar does not put Texas first, he puts himself first,\" said Delanie Bomar, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not -- they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on.\"\n\nCuellar, 66, a lawyer, is a former customs broker and Texas secretary of state. A member of the centrist Blue Dogs and New Democrat Coalition, Cuellar was elected to the House in 2004.\n\nHe's the only Democrat left in Congress who opposes abortion rights -- a position that has infuriated many in his party.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person",

Henry Cuellar, sources say", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is expected to announce the indictment of longtime Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, on Friday, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo, Texas, were raided in January 2022 as part of a federal investigation into Azerbaijan and a group of U.S. businessmen who have ties to the country, law enforcement said at the time. His office had pledged to cooperate with the investigation. In April, Cuellar's lawyer, Joshua Berman, told some news outlets that federal authorities informed him he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if the indictment was related to the 2022 raid. The Justice Department declined to comment. NBC News has reached out to Cuellar and a lawyer representing him for comment.\n\nCuellar is a one-time co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nA year after the raid -- which had not previously yielded arrests or charges -- Cuellar told the Texas Tribune: \"There has been no wrongdoing on my part. ... My focus remains the same from my very first day in office: delivering results for Texans across my district.\"\n\nDespite the raid, Cuellar narrowly defeated a progressive challenger, Jessica Cisneros, in his 2022 primary and went on to win re-election to his seat that November. He didn't face a primary challenger this year and will be on the ballot this November seeking his 11th term in Congress.\n\nTwo years ago, Cuellar easily defeated Republican nominee Cassy Garcia 57% to 43%.

Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife are indicted over ties to Azerbaijan", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges and taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, Cuellar, 68, and his wife accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico, and in exchange, Cuellar agreed to advance the interests of the country and the bank in the U.S., according to the indictment.\n\nAmong other things, Cuellar agreed to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House, the indictment states.\n\nThe Department of Justice said the couple surrendered to authorities on Friday and were taken into custody. They made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nThe longtime congressman released a statement Friday saying he and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, 67, \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nNeither Cuellar nor his attorney immediately responded to calls seeking comment on the matter.\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they face up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a \"sham contract,\" purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment states.\n\nImelda Cuellar sent a falsified invoice to the Azerbaijan energy company's Washington, D.C., office under the agreement, stating her work was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imelda Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nThe indictment also alleges an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as \"el Jefe\" or \"boss,\" and also that a member of Cuellar's staff sent multiple emails to officials at the Department of State pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation. That search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington, D.C., and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nCuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In exchange, Cuellar agreed to work to further the interests of the Eastern European country, agency officials said.\n\nThe Cuellars made their first appearance in a Houston courtroom Friday and were taken into custody, The Associated Press reported.\n\nBefore the indictments became public, Cuellar issued a statement saying he and his wife were innocent and he still plans to seek reelection in November.\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, the government of Azerbaijan paid Cuellar and his wife through \"sham contracts\" laundered through a series of shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who did little to no work for the money.\n\nIn exchange, the Justice Department said, Henry Cuellar allegedly used his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in Azerbaijan's favor. In exchange for money from the Mexican bank, Cuellar allegedly agreed to \"advise and pressure\" high-ranking U.S. officials to take steps favorable to the bank, the agency said.\n\nThe FBI raided Cuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo on Jan. 19, 2022, although he was not identified as a target of an investigation. ABC News reported the raid was tied to \"a wide-ranging federal probe relating to the former Soviet state of Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen.\"\n\nCuellar has been co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nSix weeks after the raid, Cuellar fell short of winning his primary by about 700 votes, although he won the runoff.\n\nCuellar said in his statement that he had sought advice from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm before taking actions described in the indictments.\n\n\"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people,\" he said.\n\nCuellar said he had requested a meeting with prosecutors, but they refused to discuss the case or hear his side of the story.\n\n\"Imelda and I have been married for 32 years. On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working with banking, tax, and consulting,\" Cuellar said. \"The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive.\"\n\nCuellar, who has been in Congress since 2005, is a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nU.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, House minority leader, said in a statement that rules require Cuellar to take leave as ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while the charges are pending.\n\n\"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Jeffries said.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee called on Cuellar's Democratic colleagues to pressure him to resign.\n\n\"If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar said in a statement.\n\nCuellar represents a south Texas swing district that has helped determine which party controls the U.S. House.\n\nHe is among the most moderate Democrats in the House, breaking with his party at times on issues such as border security and abortion rights. Those positions have drawn the fire of progressives who have tried unsuccessfully to dislodge him with primary challenges.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, and his wife, Imelda, charging the couple with bribery and money laundering in connection with their ties to a bank in Mexico and an oil and gas company controlled by Azerbaijan.\n\nNBC News was the first to report that the charges were coming. The congressman and his wife were each released on $100,000 bond after their initial appearance in federal court in Houston, a DOJ spokesman said Friday afternoon.\n\nAccording to the indictment, from 2014 to 2021, the Cuellars allegedly accepted approximately $600,000 in bribes from the two foreign entities in exchange for the congressman performing official acts.\n\nThe bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to bogus consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen in shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little or no legitimate work under the contracts, the DOJ said in a statement.\n\nIn exchange for bribes paid by the Azerbaijan oil and gas company, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence US foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan,\" the DOJ continued. \"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Congressman Cuellar. allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure senior US Executive Branch officials on measures beneficial to the bank.\n\nThe congressman and his wife are each charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official and to have a public official act as an agent of a foreign principal; two counts of bribery of a federal official; two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; two counts of violating the prohibition on public officials acting as agents of a foreign directorate; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering; and five counts of money laundering.\n\nIf convicted, they could spend years or even decades in prison.\n\nIn a statement Friday before the charges were unsealed, Cuellar denied any wrongdoing, saying he had proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, which had issued more than one written opinion on the matter. . Much of his statement focused on his wife.\n\nI want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these charges. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas, Cuellar said in his statement, later adding: The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the best interest of the american people.\n\nImelda and I have been married for 32 years. In addition to being a wonderful wife and mother, she is an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working in banking, tax and consulting, he continued. Claiming that she is anything but qualified and hard-working is both wrong and insulting.\n\nA defiant Cuellar also made it clear that he will still seek re-election: Let me be clear, I am running for re-election and I will win this November.\n\nA statement from the congressman's defense attorneys was similar to Cuellar's, but also pointed out that prosecutors indicted him just six months before Election Day.\n\n\"The governments decision to press ahead with the allegations so close to the general election and their decision to execute a search warrant 40 days before it. [2022] primary undermines the electorate and puts a finger on the scale,\" said attorneys Chris Flood and Eric Reed.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other top Democratic leaders had endorsed Cuellar's re-election bid last summer. In a statement, Jeffries spokeswoman Christie Stephenson called Cuellar a \"valued member of the House Democratic Caucus,\" noting that Cuellar is \"entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the process legal\".\n\nMeanwhile, Cuellar will step down from his position as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Department of Homeland Security, Stephenson said.\n\nCuellars' home and campaign office in Laredo, Texas, were raided in January 2022 as part of a federal investigation into Azerbaijan and a group of American businessmen with ties to the country, law enforcement said at the time. His office had pledged to cooperate with the investigation. In April, Cuellar's attorney, Joshua Berman,said some mediathat federal authorities informed him that he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar is a one-time co-chair of the Azerbaijan Congressional Caucus. According to the indictment, in exchange for bribes, Cuellar promised to influence legislation related to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia; inserting pro-Azerbaijani language into legislation and committee reports on security and economic assistance programs; deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the House of Representatives; and to \"consult\" with Azerbaijani officials regarding their efforts to lobby the US government.\n\nBefore the indictment was issued, Cuellars' staff was calling other members' offices Friday to ask for advice on how to handle the situation, a source with knowledge of those calls told NBC News.\n\nA year after the raid on his home, which has previously resulted in no arrests or charges, Cuellar told the Texas Tribune: There was no wrongdoing on my part. ... My focus remains the same since my first day in office: delivering results for Texans across my district.\n\nDespite the raid, Cuellar narrowly defeated a progressive challenger, Jessica Cisneros, in his 2022 primary and went on to win re-election in his seat that November. He did not face a primary challenger this year and will be on the ballot this November seeking his 11th term in Congress.\n\nTwo years ago, Cuellar easily defeated Republican candidate Cassy Garcia, 57% to 43%. His district became bluer when he took over parts of San Antonio after redistricting. But the indictment will make Cuellar more vulnerable than in the past; in 2020, Joe Biden won Cuellar's district over Donald Trump by 7 percentage points.\n\nTwo Republicans will face each other in a runoff election in late May for a chance to take on Cuellar in the fall.\n\nHenry Cuellar doesn't put Texas first, he puts himself first,\" said Delanie Bomar, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Congressional Committee. \"If his colleagues really believe in putting people over politics, they will call on him to resign. If not, they are hypocrites whose public service announcements are not worth the paper they are written on.\n\nCuellar is facing a call to resign from a member of his own party, Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who said in a post to X on Friday night that \"while the bar for the federal lawsuit is high, confidence in our government is low.\"\n\n\"This is why incumbents and candidates under indictment must resign or end their campaigns, including Sen. Bob Menendez, Donald Trump and Rep. Henry Cuellar,\" continued Phillips, who was among the first that called on Menendez to resign.\n\nCuellar, 66, an attorney, is a former Texas customs broker and secretary of state. A member of the centrist Blue Dogs and New Democrat coalition, Cuellar was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004.\n\nHe is the only Democrat left in Congress who opposes abortion rights, a position that has angered many in his party.\n\nThe Cuellars are the second congressional couple to be indicted in a foreign bribery scheme in the past year. In September, the DOJ indicted then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez, DN.J., and his wife for allegedly accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars, including gold bullion, in exchange for official acts intended to enrich three businessmen of New Jersey and benefit. the Egyptian government. Both Cuellar and Menendez are members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nMenendez, who resigned as director of Foreign Relations, has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled to begin later this month.\n\nA third lawmaker, New York Republican George Santos, was expelled from the House in December after a scathing ethics report and a 23-count federal indictment charging him with crimes such as wire fraud and money laundering. . Santos has also pleaded not guilty.\n\nCORRECTION (May 3, 2024, 4:59 pm ET): Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article misattributed a statement.

Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into ties between American business leaders and the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, Cuellar and his wife accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico, and in exchange, Cuellar agreed to advance the interests of the country and the bank in the U.S., according to the indictments.\n\nAmong other things, Cuellar agreed to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House, the indictment states.\n\nThe longtime congressman released a statement Friday saying he and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nNeither Cuellar nor his attorney immediately responded to calls seeking comment on the matter. Officials with the U.S. Department of Justice declined to discuss the matter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation. That search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington, D.C., and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press.

Cuellar previously co-chaired the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus and was said to be cooperating with the FBI's investigation more than two years ago. His office later claimed that Cuellar was not the target of that investigation.\n\nIn a statement released by his campaign Friday morning, Cuellar declared that he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations\" and said \"everything\" he's done in Congress \"has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\n\"These allegations have been difficult on my family,\" Cuellar lamented. \"But, with your prayers, we will overcome.\" Despite the looming indictment from Biden's DOJ, a defiant Cuellar said he is still \"running for re-election and will win this November.\"\n\nMore from Cuellar's statement that came out as reports broke the imminently looming indictment:\n\nImelda and I have been married for 32 years. On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working with banking, tax, and consulting. The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive.\n\nAs the son of migrant workers, I was taught to wake up early and work hard. That's exactly what I've always done for the people of South Texas. I've devoted my life's work to creating jobs here, improving education, and securing our border.\n\nCuellar added in his statement that he \"proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee\" and obtained \"an additional opinion from a national law firm\" related to the matter, but an attempt to get a meeting with the Justice Department \"to explain the facts\" did not happen. \"[T]hey refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side,\" Cuellar said.\n\nAccording to the NBC News report, Cuellar's aides were \"calling other member offices Friday seeking advice on how to handle the situation.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_brown@townhall.com", "name": "Spencer Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Migrant worker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2019/112/45c1d9b7-b404-4eea-bb48-f6a8a04ce90a.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537117", "eventUri": "eng-9537117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Henry Cuellar and wife indicted on bribery schemes", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife have been indicted in two schemes involving unlawful foreign influence, bribery and money laundering, the Justice Department announced Friday.\n\nAn indictment unsealed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas accused the Texas Democrat and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, of taking about $600,000 in bribes from the government of Azerbaijan and an unnamed foreign bank headquartered in Mexico City.\n\n\"The bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts,\" a Justice Department press release said.\n\nCuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan and agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. executive branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the Mexican bank, the DOJ said.\n\nCuellar and his wife each face a range of federal criminal charges, including five counts of money laundering, two counts of bribery of a federal official and two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, according to the Justice Department.\n\nCuellar and his wife made their initial court appearance on Friday before a U.S. magistrate judge in Texas, the Justice Department said.\n\nRepresentatives for Cuellar could not be immediately reached for comment Friday.\n\nIn a widely circulated statement, Cuellar asserted his and his wife's innocence and that his actions were consistent with those of his colleagues. Cuellar also argued that his wife, who has a career in business and tax consulting, was qualified to do her work.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar's statement said.\n\nCuellar's statement said he had consulted with the House Ethics Committee about his actions and intended to run for reelection this fall.\n\n\"Let me be clear, I'm running for re-election and will win this November,\" the statement said.\n\nThe indictment comes more than two years after Cuellar's home was reportedly raided by the FBI in connection with a federal investigation related to Azerbaijan.\n\nThe indictment alleged in one scheme that Cuellar and his wife were recruited by the company controlled by the Azerbaijani government shortly after a 2013 trip to Turkey and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe couple then entered multiple sham contracts with the company to receive bribes, the indictment alleged, in exchange for advocating for Azerbaijani interests in Congress.\n\n\"Pursuant to these corrupt agreements, HENRY CUELLAR promised to use the power and prestige of his office to advance Azerbaijan's and Foreign Bank-1's interests in the United States,\" the indictment said.\n\nThat included Cuellar advocating for greater Azerbaijani control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region that borders Armenia, working on immigration issues for an Azerbaijani citizen and promoting Azerbaijan as a U.S. ally, according to the indictment.\n\nOver the years, Cuellar communicated with foreign officials about language in the National Defense Authorization Act, appropriations bills and speeches he planned to give in Congress, and other matters, the indictment states.\n\nCuellar repeatedly referred to an unnamed foreign diplomat as \"Sir\" in text message exchanges included in the indictment. In one such exchange, the unnamed foreign diplomat asked Cuellar to ask an unnamed House member, a member of the Congressional Armenian Caucus, to withdraw an amendment that would pay to remove land mines from the Nagorno-Karabakh region.\n\nIn the second scheme alleged by the indictment, a Mexican bank established a financial relationship between the Cuellar couple and two other unnamed people to facilitate bribe payments starting in 2016.\n\nThe indictment alleged that in exchange for the payments, Cuellar advocated for the bank's interests, including an increase in correspondent bank relationships between banks based in Mexico and America.\n\nCuellar's steps included meetings with high-ranking executive branch officials, consulting with officials at the Mexican bank about banking issues, legislation before Congress, the indictment states.\n\nCuellar, who has served in Congress since 2005, represents a Texas district that stretches from parts of San Antonio to a swath of the southern border with Mexico.\n\nHe is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and is known as one of the more conservative Democrats in the chamber. He's the only remaining Democrat in Congress who opposes abortion rights.\n\nChristie Stephenson, a spokeswoman for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who previously endorsed Cuellar for reelection, said in a statement Friday that Cuellar has \"devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus\" but that Cuellar would leave his post as ranking member of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee during the case.\n\n\"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Stephenson said.\n\nCuellar beat progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros in a close 2022 primary race. He went on to defeat Republican opponent Cassy Garcia in the general election with a tally of 57 percent to 43 percent of the vote.\n\nTwo Republicans, Jay Furman and Lazaro Garza Jr., will face each other in the GOP runoff later this month to decide who runs for Cuellar's seat in the fall.\n\nIn a video posted on social media in January 2022, Cuellar said there was an ongoing investigation, but said the probe would show there was \"no wrongdoing\" on his part.\n\nWith control of the House determined by a few dozen competitive seats this fall, the fate of Cuellar's seat could decide partisan control of the chamber.\n\n\u00a92024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

Henry Cuellar and wife indicted on bribery schemes", "body": "Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife have been indicted in two schemes involving unlawful foreign influence, bribery and money laundering, the Justice Department announced Friday.\n\nA press release from the Justice Department said the Public Integrity Section had unsealed an indictment accusing the Texas Democrat and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, of taking about $600,000 in bribes from the government of Azerbaijan and an unnamed foreign bank headquartered in Mexico City.\n\n\"The bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts,\" the Justice Department said.\n\nCuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan and agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. executive branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the Mexican bank, the DOJ said.\n\nCuellar and his wife each face a range of federal criminal charges, including five counts of money laundering, two counts of bribery of a federal official and two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, according to the Justice Department.\n\nCuellar and his wife made their initial court appearance on Friday before a U.S. magistrate judge in Texas, the Justice Department said.\n\nRepresentatives for Cuellar could not be immediately reached for comment Friday.\n\nIn a widely circulated statement, Cuellar asserted his and his wife's innocence and that his actions were consistent with those of his colleagues. Cuellar also argued that his wife, who has a career in business and tax consulting, was qualified to do her work.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar's statement said.\n\nCuellar's statement said he had consulted with the House Ethics Committee about his actions and intended to run for reelection this fall.\n\n\"Let me be clear, I'm running for re-election and will win this November,\" the statement said.\n\nThe indictment comes more than two years after Cuellar's home was reportedly raided by the FBI in connection with a federal investigation related to Azerbaijan.\n\nCuellar, who has served in Congress since 2005, represents a Texas district that stretches from parts of San Antonio to a swath of the southern border with Mexico.\n\nHe is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and is known as one of the more conservative Democrats in the chamber. He's the only remaining Democrat in Congress who opposes abortion rights.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who previously endorsed Cuellar for reelection, said in a statement Friday that Cuellar has \"devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus\" but that Cuellar would leave his post as ranking member of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee during the case.\n\n\"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Jeffries' statement said.\n\nCuellar beat progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros in a close 2022 primary race. He went on to defeat Republican opponent Cassy Garcia in the general election with a tally of 57 percent to 43 percent of the vote.\n\nCuellar does not face any opponents in the state's upcoming primary runoff later this month. Two Republicans, Jay Furman and Lazaro Garza Jr., will face each other in the GOP runoff to decide who runs for Cuellar's seat in the fall.\n\nIn a video posted on social media in January 2022, Cuellar said there was an ongoing investigation, but said the probe would show there was \"no wrongdoing\" on his part.\n\nWith control of the House determined by a few dozen competitive seats this fall, the fate of Cuellar's seat could decide partisan control of the chamber.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Henry Cuellar of Texas vows to continue his bid for an 11th...", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) - For two decades, U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar has stood out as a moderate Democrat along the Texas-Mexico border, bucking his party at times over guns and immigration while seldom facing a tough reelection.\n\nBut a federal indictment accusing Cuellar of federal conspiracy and bribery charges is putting the Laredo native who was first elected in 2004 in a different spotlight. Cuellar, 68, and his wife, Imelda, 67, were taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe congressman professed his innocence after the indictment was revealed and vowed to continue his bid for an 11th term in November, saying, \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nThe Cuellars are accused of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar allegedly agreed to advance those entities' interests in the U.S.\n\nThe couple surrendered to authorities, made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nCuellar's family is a political fixture along the border: His brother is the sheriff in Laredo, and his sister, a former municipal judge, is also on the ballot this year, running as a Democratic candidate for state representative.\n\nFILE - Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, speaks during a hearing of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Capitol Hill, April 10, 2024, in Washington. In a statement released Friday, May 3, Cuellar denied any wrongdoing amid reports of pending indictments related to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)\n\nSeveral of Cuellar's allies in the district, which stretches from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio suburbs, expressed surprise over the indictments but said they would still support his reelection. Cuellar's moderate politics have helped him maintain support in places where Democrats have lost ground, like Starr County, a rural and agricultural part of South Texas.\n\n\"It is extremely surprising for me because I\u00b4ve known Henry for many, many years,\" Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said. \"He\u00b4s always been a very straight guy, you know, very sincere. I mean, he\u00b4s done so much for us in Starr County. I hate to see this going on.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Starr County by a slim, single-digit margin. Two years later, Cuellar won it by 40%.\n\nSylvia Bruni, chair of nearby Webb County\u00b4s Democratic Party, said she would trust the legal system to work fairly and her focus would remain on elections. \"We have a campaign to advance, our Democracy at stake,\" she said in a statement.\n\nCuellar released a statement Friday saying he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they could be punished with up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple\u00b4s children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a \"sham contract,\" purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment says.\n\nImelda Cuellar is alleged to have sent a falsified invoice to the energy company's Washington, D.C., office under the agreement, saying her work was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imelda Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nThe indictment alleges that an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as both \"el Jefe\" and \"boss,\" and also that a member of Cuellar\u00b4s staff sent multiple emails to officials at the State Department pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat\u00b4s daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman\u00b4s house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar\u00b4s attorney at that time said he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022. Cuellar has been among his party's loudest critics of Biden, particularly over the administration's response to a record number of migrant crossings on the border. His moderate politics have aligned him at times with Republicans on issues including abortion and guns. ___\n\nGonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas.

Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges and taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, Cuellar, 68, and his wife allegedly accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico, according to the indictment. In exchange, Cuellar is accused of agreeing to advance the interests of the country and the bank in the U.S., also according to the indictment.\n\nAmong other things, Cuellar agreed to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House, the indictment states.\n\nThe Department of Justice said the couple surrendered to authorities on Friday and were taken into custody. They made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nThe longtime congressman released a statement Friday saying he and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, 67, \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\nNeither Cuellar nor his attorney immediately responded to calls seeking comment on the matter.\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they face up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a contract, purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment states.\n\nThe indictment also alleges an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as \"boss\" and also that a member of Cuellar's staff sent multiple emails to officials at the Department of State pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation. That search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republics of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mail and wire fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_forfeiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asset forfeiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_passport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States passport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shell corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laredo,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/6338D422-6B48-46DD-A6DC-EE1F6AE4F1C5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537117", "eventUri": "eng-9537117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Henry Cuellar and wife indicted on bribery and foreign influence charges", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Friday released an indictment against longtime Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, and his wife, Imelda, charging the pair with bribery and money laundering related to their ties with a bank in Mexico and an oil and gas company controlled by Azerbaijan.\n\nNBC News was first to report that the charges were coming. The congressman and his wife were each released on a $100,000 bond after a first appearance in federal court in Houston, a DOJ spokesperson said Friday afternoon.\n\nAccording to the indictment, from 2014 to 2021, the Cuellars allegedly accepted roughly $600,000 in bribes from the two foreign entities in exchange for the congressman performing official acts.\n\n\"The bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts,\" the DOJ said in a statement.\n\n\"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Azerbaijani oil and gas company, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan,\" DOJ continued. \"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank.\"\n\nThe congressman and his wife are each charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official and to have a public official act as an agent of a foreign principal; two counts of bribery of a federal official; two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal; one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering; and five counts of money laundering.\n\nIf convicted, they could spend years or even decades in prison.\n\nIn a statement Friday before the charges were unsealed, Cuellar denied any wrongdoing, saying that he had \"proactively sought legal advice\" from the House Ethics Committee, which had issued \"more than one written opinion\" about the matter. Much of his statement focused on his wife.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said in his statement, later adding: \"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\n\"Imelda and I have been married for 32 years. On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working with banking, tax, and consulting,\" he continued. \"The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive.\"\n\nA defiant Cuellar also made clear he will still seek re-election: \"Let me be clear, I'm running for re-election and will win this November.\"\n\nA statement from the congressman's defense attorneys was similar to Cuellar's but also noted prosecutors indicted him just six months before Election Day.\n\n\"The government's decision to move forward with charges so close to the general election -- and their decision to execute a search warrant 40 days before his [2022] primary -- undermines the electorate and puts a thumb on the scale,\" said attorneys Chris Flood and Eric Reed.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other top Democratic leaders had endorsed Cuellar's re-election bid last summer. In a statement, Jeffries spokesperson Christie Stephenson called Cuellar a \"valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus,\" noting that Cuellar is \"entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Cuellar will step aside from his position as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing the Department of Homeland Security, Stephenson said.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo, Texas, were raided in January 2022 as part of a federal investigation into Azerbaijan and a group of U.S. businessmen who have ties to the country, law enforcement said at the time. His office had pledged to cooperate with the investigation. In April, Cuellar's lawyer, Joshua Berman, told some news outlets that federal authorities informed him he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar is a one-time co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus. According to the indictment, in exchange for the bribes, Cuellar promised to influence legislation related to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia; insert pro-Azerbaijan language into legislation and committee reports on security and economic aid programs; deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the House floor; and \"consult\" with Azerbaijan officials about their efforts to lobby the U.S. government.\n\nAhead of the indictment's release, Cuellar's staff were calling other member offices Friday seeking advice on how to handle the situation, one source with knowledge of those calls told NBC News.\n\nA year after the raid on his home -- which has not previously yielded arrests or charges -- Cuellar told the Texas Tribune: \"There has been no wrongdoing on my part. ... My focus remains the same from my very first day in office: delivering results for Texans across my district.\"\n\nDespite the raid, Cuellar narrowly defeated a progressive challenger, Jessica Cisneros, in his 2022 primary and went on to win re-election to his seat that November. He didn't face a primary challenger this year and will be on the ballot this November seeking his 11th term in Congress.\n\nTwo years ago, Cuellar easily defeated Republican nominee Cassy Garcia, 57% to 43%. His district became bluer when he picked up parts of San Antonio following redistricting. But the indictment will make Cuellar more vulnerable than in the past; in 2020, Joe Biden won Cuellar's district over Donald Trump by 7 percentage points.\n\nTwo Republicans will face each other in a runoff election in late May for a chance to take on Cuellar in the fall.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar does not put Texas first, he puts himself first,\" said Delanie Bomar, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not -- they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on.\"\n\nCuellar, 66, a lawyer, is a former customs broker and Texas secretary of state. A member of the centrist Blue Dogs and New Democrat Coalition, Cuellar was elected to the House in 2004.\n\nHe's the only Democrat left in Congress who opposes abortion rights -- a position that has infuriated many in his party.\n\nThe Cuellars are the second congressional couple to be charged in a foreign bribery scheme in the past year. In September, DOJ charged then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and his wife after they allegedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars, including gold bars, in return for official acts aimed at enriching three New Jersey businessmen and benefitting the Egyptian government. Both Cuellar and Menendez are members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nMenendez, who stepped aside from leading Foreign Relations, has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled to begin later this month.\n\nA third lawmaker, New York Republican George Santos, was expelled from the House in December after a scathing ethics report and 23-count federal indictment charging him with crimes such as wire fraud and money laundering. Santos also has pleaded not guilty.\n\nCORRECTION (May 3, 2024, 4:59 p.m. ET): Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article misattributed a statement.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)WASHINGTON (AP) - Democratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into ties between American business leaders and the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. From 2014 to 2021, Cuellar and his wife accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico, and in exchange, Cuellar agreed to advance the interests of the country and the bank in the U.S., according to the indictments. Among other things, Cuellar agreed to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House, the indictment states. The longtime congressman released a statement Friday saying he and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\u009d \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\"\u009d Cuellar said. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm. \"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\u009d Neither Cuellar nor his attorney immediately responded to calls seeking comment on the matter. Officials with the U.S. Department of Justice declined to discuss the matter. Cuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus. The FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation. That search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington, D.C., and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Federal disclosures show that the nine-term congressman traveled to Azerbaijan in 2013. Two years later, Cuellar's office announced an agreement between a Texas university and an organization called the Assembly of Friends of Azerbaijan for the purposes of collaborating on oil and gas research and education. Cuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022.e challenger Jessica Cisneros

They allegedly used the proceeds from the bribery schemes to pay taxes, pay down debt and spend tens of thousands of dollars at restaurants and retail stores. One purchase was for a $12,000 custom gown, according to the indictment.\n\nNow, as readers will remember, Henry Cuellar had his offices raided by the FBI back in January 2022, after he made a name for himself directly challenging the Biden administration regarding border security. Cuellar is also that rarest of political specimens, a pro-life Democrat. Is it beyond imagination that the Department of Justice and the FBI could have had it out for him? We certainly have seen a lot of lawfare over the last several years. Cuellar was told in 2022 that he was not the target of the investigation, but obviously, something changed along the way. If there is a money trail, and it can be shown that foreign payments were laundered through shell companies for the personal benefit of Cuellar and his wife, then obviously, they are in deep legal trouble. The kind of trouble reserved for people who don't have the last name Biden.\n\nSnark about double standards aside, Cuellar is getting far kinder treatment than, say, George Santos did. There is no talk about expulsion over this indictment. Democrats are more than happy to allow for the presumption of innocence for their side of the aisle, and all they want Cuellar to do is step aside as ranking member on his committee.\n\nRep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) is set to become top Democrat on the House subcommittee that crafts Homeland Security Department (DHS) funding, replacing Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) shortly after he was indicted on bribery charges.\n\nThe news comes shortly after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries's (D-N.Y.) office confirmed Cuellar would be stepping down from the role following reports that the Texas Democrat and his wife had been indicted. Cuellar has been alleged to have accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes and laundered the funds.\n\nJeffries' office said that Cuellar would take leave pursuant to House rules.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus,\" the office said. \"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process.\"\n\n\"Pursuant to House Democratic Caucus Rule 24, Congressman Cuellar will take leave as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while this matter is ongoing.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Rule 24 simply lists who is next up if a chair of a committee is indicted. Rule 25 says that if that person is convicted, they don't get to serve as chair any more. Nothing about being asked to resign or being expelled or anything.\n\nCuellar, for his part, is saying that he is innocent, and that yes, he is still running for re-election.\n\nThe congressman professed his innocence after the indictment was revealed and vowed to continue his bid for an 11th term in November, saying, \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nThere is one interesting tidbit of information that came from Cuellar himself during his statement to the press after leaving the federal courthouse.\n\nCuellar also said he \"proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the House Ethics Committee declined to comment on Friday.\n\nNow, if Cuellar has a paper trail from the House Ethics Committee, and the DOJ decided to indict him anyway, this will make for a very contentious legal battle. According to local news, Cuellar has been part of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, and traveled there in 2013 - which is where the legal issues may have begun.\n\nHe traveled to Turkey and Azerbaijan on a $25,000 trip with his wife Imelda in 2013, paid for by the Turquoise Council of Americans and Eurasians. Shortly after, a Cuellar staffer went on another trip to Azerbaijan with several members, including Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, that was also facilitated by the group.\n\nAfter his 2013 trip, agents working on behalf of the Azerbaijani government recruited Cuellar to work with them on U.S. policy helping their country, according to the indictment.\n\nThe group that hosted Cuellar's trip is based in Texas and was led by Kemal Oksuz, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to partaking in the coverup of the Azerbaijani's government's role financing the 2013 congressional trip that included Jackson Lee. Oksuz admitted to lying in disclosures to the House Ethics Committee on the source of funding for the trip, which came from the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic.\n\nAfter Oksuz's guilty plea, payments from SOCAR to the Cuellar's paused, according to the indictment.\n\nOksuz also worked with Cuellar to establish a program for Texas A&M International University students to study energy issues in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. ExxonMobil and the Azerbaijani government were also involved in the creation of the program.\n\nCuellar has already won his primary race for his Congressional seat, but there is a runoff election for who will be his Republican opponent. With this indictment, and him staying in the race, will a Republican be able to win the general election? I guess we will see. The charges are certainly sensational, but the burden of proof is on the DOJ. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress should be drawing up a vote to expel Henry Cuellar, as dumb and pointless as it might be, just to prove the point about George Santos, and make Democrats squirm a little.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type":

Henry Cuellar declares innocence ahead of reported DOJ indictment", "body": "By Cayla Harris, Benjamin Wermund, San Antonio Express-News The Tribune Content Agency\n\nMay 3-Federal investigators plan to indict longtime U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar of Laredo, NBC News reported Friday.\n\nThe details of the indictment are not yet available, and it's unclear whether the action is related to the FBI's raid of Cuellar's home and campaign office in January 2022. ABC News reported at the time that the investigation was part of a wide-ranging federal probe relating to the former Soviet state of Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen.\n\nBACKGROUND: Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar's long ties to convicted Azerbaijani businessman scrutinized amid FBI probe\n\nIn a statement, Cuellar made no mention of the FBI but maintained his innocence and said he still plans to run for reelection this fall. Cuellar's attorney told reporters in 2022 that the Democrat, who is a member of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, was not a target of the probe.\n\n\"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people,\" Cuellar said.\n\nWithout providing context, Cuellar said that he proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee \"before I took any action.\" He said he also requested a meeting with federal prosecutors to \"explain the facts,\" but they declined to discuss the case.\n\n\"These allegations have been difficult on my family,\" Cuellar said. \"But, with your prayers, we will overcome.\"\n\nThe scope of the indictments was unclear, but in his statement, Cuellar said \"both my wife and I are innocent.\" The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCuellar was once the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, and he has a long relationship with the nation's ambassador, Elin Suleymanov, whom he has credited with helping to establish a partnership between Texas A&M International University and the Assembly of the Friends of Azerbaijan.\n\nHe also has ties to a Houston-based businessman who was convicted of lying to Congress about Azerbaijan's role in funding a 2013 trip to the western Asian nation for 10 lawmakers, federal records show.\n\nKemal Oksuz, who pleaded guilty in that case, was a regular campaign donor to Cuellar and other Texas politicians and in 2015 enlisted Cuellar to establish the partnership. Cuellar and his wife had been issued subpoenas for information including records related to Oksuz and the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic, ABC reported in early 2022.\n\nCuellar has represented South Texas in Congress since 2005. He is among the most moderate representatives in the U.S. House and the only anti-abortion Democrat.\n\nThe congressman faced two difficult primary challenges in 2020 and 2022 from a more progressive Democrat, immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, but eked out a victory both times. In November 2022, he beat a Republican opponent by more than 13 percentage points.\n\nCuellar did not have a Democratic primary challenger this year. He has two potential Republican opponents, Jay Furman and Lazaro Garza Jr., who are headed to a runoff at the end of this month.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Henry Cuellar of Texas vows to continue his bid for an 11th term despite bribery indictment", "body": "FILE - Federal agents search the home of Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, in Laredo, Texas, Jan. 19, 2022. Cuellar and his wife were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges and taken into custody Friday, May 3, 2024, in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- For two decades, U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar has stood out as a moderate Democrat along the Texas-Mexico border, bucking his party at times over guns and immigration while seldom facing a tough reelection.\n\nBut a federal indictment accusing Cuellar of federal conspiracy and bribery charges is putting the Laredo native who was first elected in 2004 in a different spotlight. Cuellar, 68, and his wife, Imelda, 67, were taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe congressman professed his innocence after the indictment was revealed and vowed to continue his bid for an 11th term in November, saying, \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nThe Cuellars are accused of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar allegedly agreed to advance those entities' interests in the U.S.\n\nThe couple surrendered to authorities, made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nCuellar's family is a political fixture along the border: His brother is the sheriff in Laredo, and his sister, a former municipal judge, is also on the ballot this year, running as a Democratic candidate for state representative.\n\nSeveral of Cuellar's allies in the district, which stretches from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio suburbs, expressed surprise over the indictments but said they would still support his reelection. Cuellar's moderate politics have helped him maintain support in places where Democrats have lost ground, like Starr County, a rural and agricultural part of South Texas.\n\n\"It is extremely surprising for me because I've known Henry for many, many years,\" Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said. \"He's always been a very straight guy, you know, very sincere. I mean, he's done so much for us in Starr County. I hate to see this going on.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Starr County by a slim, single-digit margin. Two years later, Cuellar won it by 40%.\n\nSylvia Bruni, chair of nearby Webb County's Democratic Party, said she would trust the legal system to work fairly and her focus would remain on elections. \"We have a campaign to advance, our Democracy at stake,\" she said in a statement.\n\nCuellar released a statement Friday saying he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they could be punished with up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a \"sham contract,\" purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment says.\n\nImelda Cuellar is alleged to have sent a falsified invoice to the energy company's Washington, D.C., office under the agreement, saying her work was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imelda Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nThe indictment alleges that an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as both \"el Jefe\" and \"boss,\" and also that a member of Cuellar's staff sent multiple emails to officials at the State Department pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022. Cuellar has been among his party's loudest critics of Biden, particularly over the administration's response to a record number of migrant crossings on the border. His moderate politics have aligned him at times with Republicans on issues including abortion and guns. ___\n\nGonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas.

This year, two Republican candidates face each other in a runoff election on May 28 for the opportunity to race against Cuellar in November.\n\nThough his seat is rated \"likely Democratic\" by Cook Political Report, an indictment could slim his reelection chances.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_schilke@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Rachel Schilke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ashley_oliver@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ashley Oliver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honest_services_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honest services fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laredo,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24101557468099.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537117", "eventUri": "eng-9537117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 2139, "textEnd": 2145}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

'He was for Border Control, so they said, \"Let's use the FBI and DOJ to take him out!\" This is the way they operate. They're a bunch of D.C. Thugs.'\n\nTwo bribes, which amounted to $598,000, allegedly came from an oil and gas company owned by the Azerbaijani government and a bank headquartered in Mexico City. They were reportedly funneled through shell companies owned by Imelda.\n\n'Cuellar promised to use the power and prestige of his office to advance Azerbaijan's and Foreign Bank-1's interests in the United States,' the DOJ claimed.\n\nThe pair were released on $100,000 bond on Friday. If convicted, they could each spend the rest of their lives behind bars.\n\nCuellar is the third member of Congress to be indicted this congressional term, following Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J.\n\nSantos was ousted in December but Menendez remains in the Senate, though he no longer serves as Foreign Relations chairman.\n\nTrump has issued a defense of Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar after he and his wife were indicted for allegedly accepting bribes\n\nAt least one Democrat, Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., has called on Cuellar to resign.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries declined to call on Cuellar to resign, but removed him as chair of a key funding subcommitteee.\n\nCuellar is \"'s entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,' said Jeffries, but will 'take leave as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while this matter is ongoing.'\n\n'The bribe payments were laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. Cuellar performed little or no legitimate work under the sham contracts.'\n\nThe scheme ran 'at least' from December 2014 to November 2021. The couple faces up to 204 years in prison if convicted on all counts.\n\nThe Texas Democrat's home was raided by the FBI in January 2022 as part of an investigation into his ties to Azerbaijani businessmen.\n\nCuellar insisted he and his wife were innocent in response to the news.\n\n'I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations.'\n\n'The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people,' he went on.\n\nThe embattled congressman said he plans to continue his campaign for reelection despite the indictment.\n\nCuellar said he and his wife tried to meet with prosecutors and they 'refused to discuss the case or hear our side.'\n\n'Imelda and I have been married for 32 years. On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working with banking, tax and consulting. The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard-working is both wrong and offensive.'\n\nCuellar said at the time of the raid he was cooperating with law enforcement and he did not believe he was the target of the investigation. It is not yet clear if the indictment will be related to that investigation.\n\nThe nine-term Democrat is a past co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, an obscure group dedicated to furthering relations with the oil-rich nation on the Caspian Sea.\n\nCongressman Henry Cuellar is expected to be indicted by the Department of Justice on Friday afternoon, according to multiple reports.\n\nCuellar insisted he was innocent in response to the news - and suggested his wife would be caught up in the indictment\n\nIn that role, Cuellar is known to have met repeatedly with Azerbaijan officials, including the country's ambassador to the US, Elin Suleymanov.\n\nAzerbaijan has been harshly criticized in the past for bribing foreign officials and diplomats to secure its foreign policy aims and legitimize dubious election results.\n\nThe practice is so common in the country that it is known there as 'caviar diplomacy,' but it is unclear whether the FBI is investigating any similar allegations in relation to Cuellar.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (right) is seen meeting with Azerbaijan's ambassador to the US in 2013. The FBI raid on Cuellar's home is reportedly related to a probe into Azerbaijani activities in the US\n\nFBI agents have been spotted conducting a 'court-authorized' investigation at the Texas home of United States Representative Henry Cuellar, who has vowed to cooperate fully\n\nSince 2004, Cuellar has represented a district that extends from the U.S. border with Mexico near McAllen to Laredo, and north to San Antonio's eastern outskirts.\n\nThe moderate Democrat has a seat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.\n\nPublic records show that Cuellar purchased his luxurious Laredo home in 2010.\n\nThe 6,000-square-foot, five-bedroom home in a gated community is valued at $825,000 currently by Realtor.com.\n\nCuellar, who represents much of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for their handling of a surge of illegal crossings at the border.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Through their lawyer, they denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe 54-page indictment details a bold corruption scheme in which Cuellar - who co-chairs the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus - allegedly promised to wield his power as a U.S. congressman to advocate for his benefactors.\n\nTo Azerbaijan, he pledged to influence legislation related to the country's conflict with neighboring Armenia, insert favorable language into committee reports on economic aid programs and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the House floor, the indictment says. To the Mexican bank, Cuellar allegedly promised to pressure executive branch officials to back off money laundering enforcement practices that threatened the bank's business interests and to support legislation that would block regulation of the payday lending industry, which has been accused of exploiting poor Americans.\n\nBoth husband and wife face 14 charges that include money laundering, conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official, wire fraud and more. The indictment also charges them with acting as foreign agents without properly registering with the U.S. government. They were taken into federal custody on Friday morning and, according to their attorney, released after each posted a $100,000 unsecured bond, which means they only have to pay it if they violate the terms of their release.\n\nCuellar said in a statement that he is innocent and expects to win his reelection bid in November. \"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nChris Flood, the couple's Texas-based attorney, called the charges bogus and said the congressman sought advice from lawyers and the House Ethics Committee before entering into the contracts with the Azerbaijan oil company and the Mexican bank.\n\nA spokesman for the House Ethics Committee declined to comment. The committee's legal advice to members of Congress is generally kept private.\n\nUnlike other congressional committees, Republicans and Democrats have equal representation on the ethics committee, no matter which party controls the House. The committee investigates allegations against lawmakers if they have violated House rules. It also reviews financial disclosure statements, provides ethics trainings to members and can provide advice to members about how to abide by House rules.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the House Minority Leader, said that Cuellar would step down as the ranking Democrat of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security while the legal proceedings are ongoing, but will remain on the committee. \"Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Jeffries said in a statement through his spokesperson.\n\nCuellar and his wife are the second U.S. lawmaker-spouse duo indicted on bribery charges in the last year. Last September, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and his wife were indicted on bribery charges in what officials said was a corrupt scheme involving gold bars, stacks of cash and using the senator's powerful position to secretly benefit the Egyptian and Qatari governments.\n\nMenendez's trial is set to begin later this month.\n\nThe Cuellar indictment comes two years after the congressman's home and office in Laredo, Tex., were raided by FBI agents. Cuellar's lawyers said earlier that the Justice Department told them the congressman was not the subject of the probe.\n\nCuellar was seeking reelection at the time of the raid and went on to win a 10th term in Congress that November. He is running again this cycle and could find himself in a close election in his increasingly conservative and swing district along the Texas-Mexico border. Two Republicans will face off in a primary runoff later this month to determine who will challenge him.\n\nAccording to the indictment, three different shell companies involved in the scheme were created between 2012 and 2021 and owned by Imelda Cuellar and the couple's children. Imelda Cuellar is a former tax enforcement officer who retired in 2012. As part of the contracts, she was supposed to be doing work for the companies, but prosecutors allege that she did \"little or no legitimate work.\"\n\n\"It was a purpose of the conspiracy for the defendants to use [Cuellar's] official position as a Member of the United States House of Representatives to benefit and enrich themselves through bribery,\" the indictment reads.\n\nThe indictment, which alleges that the couple accepted bribes from at least December 2014 through November 2021, includes texts and other communication between Cuellar and people affiliated with the Azerbaijan government and Mexican bank that allegedly show how he tried to carry out his promises on multiple occasions.\n\nOn Sept. 1, 2017, for example, an Azerbaijani diplomat allegedly texted Cuellar a screenshot of an appropriations amendment that would allocate $1.5 million to clear land mines in the Nagorno-Karabakh region - an effort that was supported by Armenia, but opposed by Azerbaijan.\n\n\"I see it. We work on it,\" Cuellar responded, according to the indictment.\n\n\"Thank you Boss!\" the diplomat said.\n\nProsecutors say Cuellar also sought input from a Mexican bank executive in 2015 while working on a congressional committee report on the problems involved with de-risking - which is when financial institutions restrict business relations for certain categories of clients to avoid, rather than manage, risk.\n\n\"Here are our suggestions, marked in red to facilitate the review process,\" the bank executive allegedly wrote to Cuellar, with a copy of the draft report attached.\n\n\"Got your input. I have reviewed and it's good. I am submitting to the committee tomorrow. I will keep you posted,\" Cuellar allegedly responded.\n\nCuellar, a former Texas secretary of state, has served in the House for almost two decades. He proudly wears the moderate Democrat label and has often sought to work with Republicans. Throughout his career in Washington, oil and gas has been the top industry to donate to Cuellar, totaling $1,526,969 according to the nonprofit Open Secrets.\n\nRepresenting a district on the Texas-Mexico border that's anchored around his hometown of Laredo, Cuellar has pushed the Democratic caucus over the years to seek centrist and bipartisan solutions to the border crisis, often siding with proposals made by then-president Donald Trump. Many liberals consider him a thorn in Democrats' side, complicating efforts to advance the border issue in a way most of the caucus wants to pursue.\n\nCuellar is also the last remaining House Democrat who is antiabortion. His moderate stances have earned him primary challenges in recent years, including two by liberal Jessica Cisneros, who came close to ousting him shortly after the 2022 FBI raid.\n\nLast year, Cuellar made headlines after he was carjacked about a mile from the U.S. Capitol. His car and luggage were stolen.\n\nSylvia Bruni, the chair of the Democratic Party in Webb County, where Laredo is located, said in a statement that Cuellar's situation \"is certainly distressing, casting a dark cloud over all our sincerest efforts on behalf of our community.\"\n\nShe wrote in an email that the county party \"will remain quiet regarding the allegations, presuming innocence, and trusting the Justice System to work fairly.\"", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Henry Cuellar, sources say", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is expected to announce the indictment of longtime Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, on Friday, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo, Texas, were raided in January 2022 as part of a federal investigation into Azerbaijan and a group of American businessmen with ties to the country, law enforcement said at the time. His office pledged to cooperate with the investigation. In April, Cuellar's attorney, Joshua Berman, told some news agencies Federal officials told him he was not a target for investigation.\n\nGuler is a one-time co-chairman of the Azerbaijan Caucus of Congress.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the allegation was related to the 2022 test. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nCuellar's staff called other members' offices Friday to get advice on how to handle the situation, a source with knowledge of those calls told NBC News.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Cuellar denied any wrongdoing, saying he \"proactively sought legal advice\" from the House Ethics Committee, which issued \"more than one written opinion\" on the matter. Much of his statement focused on his wife, Imelda Cuellar, although it was not immediately clear why.\n\n\"I want to make it clear that my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I did in Congress was to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said in his statement, later adding: \"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and were in the best interest of America. People...\"\n\n\"Imelda and I have been married for 32 years. In addition to being a wonderful wife and mother, she is an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She has spent her career working in banking, tax and consulting,\" he continued. \"The allegation that she is qualified and hard-working is false and offensive.\"\n\nA defiant Cuellar also made it clear that he would seek re-election: \"Let me be clear, I am running for re-election and I will win this November.\"\n\nA year after the raid on his home -- which previously yielded no arrests or charges -- Cuellar told the Texas Tribune: \"There was no wrongdoing on my part. ... My focus has remained the same since my first day in office: delivering results for Texans across my district.\"\n\nDespite the ordeal, Cuellar defeated a progressive challenger, Jessica Cisneros, in her 2022 primary and won re-election to her seat that November. He does not face a primary challenger this year and will be on the ballot this November for his 11th term in Congress.\n\nTwo years ago, Gullard easily defeated Republican candidate Casey Garcia, 57% to 43%. His district turned blue when he took parts of San Antonio following redistricting. But the indictment will make Cuellar more vulnerable than in the past; In 2020, Joe Biden won Culler's district over Donald Trump by 7 percentage points.\n\nThe two Republicans will face each other in a late May runoff for a chance to face Cueller in the fall.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar doesn't put Texas first, he puts himself first,\" said Delanie Bomar, spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"If his colleagues truly believed in putting 'people above politics', they would call for his resignation. If not - they are hypocrites whose statements on public service are not worth the paper they are written on.\"\n\nCuellar, 66, is an attorney, a former customs broker and Texas secretary of state. A member of the centrist Blue Dogs and the New Democratic Alliance, Guller was elected to the House in 2004.\n\nHe is the only Democrat left in Congress who opposes abortion rights -- a move that has angered many in his party.", "source": {"uri": "highlandstoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mid Florida Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_lindsey@highlandstoday.com", "name": "Joe

Henry Cuellar of Texas vows to continue his bid for an 11th term despite bribery indictment", "body": "FILE - Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, speaks during a hearing of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Capitol Hill, April 10, 2024, in Washington. In a statement released Friday, May 3, Cuellar denied any wrongdoing amid reports of pending indictments related to the former [...]\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- For two decades, U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar has stood out as a moderate Democrat along the Texas-Mexico border, bucking his party at times over guns and immigration while seldom facing a tough reelection.\n\nBut a federal indictment accusing Cuellar of federal conspiracy and bribery charges is putting the Laredo native who was first elected in 2004 in a different spotlight. Cuellar, 68, and his wife, Imelda, 67, were taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe congressman professed his innocence after the indictment was revealed and vowed to continue his bid for an 11th term in November, saying, \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nThe Cuellars are accused of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar allegedly agreed to advance those entities' interests in the U.S.\n\nThe couple surrendered to authorities, made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nCuellar's family is a political fixture along the border: His brother is the sheriff in Laredo, and his sister, a former municipal judge, is also on the ballot this year, running as a Democratic candidate for state representative.\n\nSeveral of Cuellar's allies in the district, which stretches from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio suburbs, expressed surprise over the indictments but said they would still support his reelection. Cuellar's moderate politics have helped him maintain support in places where Democrats have lost ground, like Starr County, a rural and agricultural part of South Texas.\n\n\"It is extremely surprising for me because I've known Henry for many, many years,\" Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said. \"He's always been a very straight guy, you know, very sincere. I mean, he's done so much for us in Starr County. I hate to see this going on.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Starr County by a slim, single-digit margin. Two years later, Cuellar won it by 40%.\n\nSylvia Bruni, chair of nearby Webb County's Democratic Party, said she would trust the legal system to work fairly and her focus would remain on elections. \"We have a campaign to advance, our Democracy at stake,\" she said in a statement.\n\nCuellar released a statement Friday saying he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they could be punished with up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a \"sham contract,\" purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment says.\n\nImelda Cuellar is alleged to have sent a falsified invoice to the energy company's Washington, D.C., office under the agreement, saying her work was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imelda Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nThe indictment alleges that an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as both \"el Jefe\" and \"boss,\" and also that a member of Cuellar's staff sent multiple emails to officials at the State Department pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022. Cuellar has been among his party's loudest critics of Biden, particularly over the administration's response to a record number of migrant crossings on the border. His moderate politics have aligned him at times with Republicans on issues including abortion and guns. ___\n\nGonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas.

Henry Cuellar and wife indicted on federal bribery charges", "body": "Washington -- Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife were indicted on more than a dozen federal charges alleging they took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from an oil company owned by the government of Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank, the Justice Department said Friday.\n\nThe 54-page indictment filed in federal district court in Houston was unsealed Friday and charges Cuellar with 14 counts including conspiracy, bribery, and money laundering. He is also accused of acting as a foreign agent to benefit the government of Azerbaijan.\n\nCuellar and his wife, Imelda Rios Cuellar, made their initial appearance before a federal magistrate judge in Houston, where they both pled not guilty and were released on an unsecured bond. The jury trial has been tentatively scheduled to begin July 8.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that Cuellar and Imelda Cuellar accepted at least $598,000 in bribes from the Azerbaijani oil and gas company and the bank, which is headquartered in Mexico City. They allege that the bribes were laundered in the form of sham consulting contracts through front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. The congressman's wife, according to the indictment, \"performed little or no legitimate\" work under the consulting contracts.\n\nProsecutors said in exchange for the bribes, Cuellar agreed to use the \"power and prestige of his office\" to advance the interests of Azerbaijan and the foreign bank, which was unidentified in the indictment.\n\nNBC News was first to report that the indictment was expected Friday. The congressman indicated in a statement before the charges were made public that he and his wife were facing criminal counts and said they are innocent.\n\nThe congressman said he will continue to seek reelection to the House in November.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" he said.\n\nThe congressman said in his statement that he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee before taking any action -- though it was not clear from the statement what actions he is referring to. The committee provided a written opinion, as well as a second one from a national law firm, he said. Cuellar and his wife also requested a meeting with prosecutors in Washington, D.C., \"to explain the facts,\" he said, but they declined to discuss the case with them.\n\nA spokesperson for Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the congressman will take leave as the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while the case is ongoing.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus. Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Christie Stephenson, Jeffries' spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the congressman's ties to Azerbaijan began in early 2013, when he and his wife traveled to Istanbul and Baku, Azerbaijan, on a trip sponsored by an organization led by a Houston resident. The unidentified resident leads two nonprofits dedicated to advancing the Azerbaijan's interest, prosecutors said.\n\nThe groups receive funding from the energy company owned by the government of Azerbaijan.\n\nShortly after the trip, according to prosecutors, officials within the Azerbaijani government \"discussed recruiting [Cuellar] to promote Azerbaijan's interests in the United States Congress.\"\n\nOne year later, in February 2014, the Justice Department said the Cuellars negotiated a \"corrupt agreement\" with the government-connected oil company, through which it would make monthly payments to a shell company Imelda Cuellar owns for purported \"strategic consulting and advising services.\"\n\nBy May of that year, after the shell companies had been created, investigators alleged Cuellar took overt steps to benefit the foreign government, telling his contacts he had \"placed language within that year's National Defense Authorization Act\" to \"develop a strategic framework for United States security force assistance and cooperation in the European and Eurasian regions,\" including in Azerbaijan.\n\nThe relationship continued for years, investigators said. According to court documents, in 2017 a diplomat from the country sent the congressman information about a land mine-clearing operation in the region that Azerbaijan opposed.\n\n\"I see it. We work on it,\" Cuellar allegedly responded. \"Thank you Boss,\" the diplomat wrote back, according to court papers.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the congressman's staff also pressured the State Department to renew the U.S. passport of an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter, and Cuellar suggested he would offer amendments to legislation relating to Azerbaijan.\n\nBut it was not just Azerbaijan. Investigators said Cuellar and his wife allegedly set up shell companies and contracts with the Mexican retail bank in an effort to launder additional funds.\n\nThe bank, according to prosecutors, needed a better reciprocal relationship with U.S. financial institutions to exchange currency. In 2015, Cuellar allegedly agreed to place certain language in House bills to support such transactions.\n\n\"From May to July 2016, [Cuellar] advised and pressured U.S. Official-3, a high-ranking Executive Branch official with responsibility for the supervision of banks, to take official acts benefitting Foreign Bank-1,\" investigators said in court documents.\n\nThe indictment revealed the Cuellars used much of their allegedly illicit proceeds to pay federal and state taxes, and make credit card and car payments. Tens of thousands of dollars were spent at restaurants and stores, prosecutors said, and they paid $12,000 for a \"custom gown,\" $7,000 for a down payment on a new car and $27,000 to insurance and telecom companies.\n\nThe alleged scheme involving Azerbaijan and the Mexican bank comes more than two years after the FBI conducted a \"court-authorized\" search of the congressman's home in Laredo and campaign office in January 2022, though Cuellar's lawyer told CBS News at the time that the congressman was not the target of a federal investigation. A source familiar with the probe said then that the activity at Cuellar's house was part of an investigation related to Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen.\n\nThe congressman's office said at the time that he was cooperating fully with the investigation, and Cuellar denied wrongdoing.\n\nCuellar was elected to the House in 2005 and represents the 28th Congressional District. His district stretches from San Antonio south to the U.S.-Mexico border. Considered a moderate Democrat, Cuellar faced a tough primary challenge from immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, his former intern, during the 2022 election cycle, but narrowly defeated her in a runoff election.\n\nCuellar, who is Catholic, is the only remaining self-identified \"pro-life\" Democrat in the House. He was in the news in October 2023 when he said he was carjacked by three armed assailants while returning to his home in the Navy Yard neighborhood of Washington, D.C.", "source": {"uri":

Henry Cuellar says the Biden administration should listen more and offer more to border communities like his while shaping immigration policy.\n\nThe Justice Department released an indictment against Texas Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar on criminal charges, multiple media outlets reported on Friday.\n\nCuellar is serving his tenth term in the U.S. House of Representatives for Texas' 28th congressional district, which includes the cities of Laredo, Rio Grande City, and San Antonio.\n\nAccording to a biography, Cuellar was born in Laredo, Texas, where he earned his associate degree from Laredo Community College before enrolling at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He later earned several postgraduate degrees in Texas before he began practicing law in 1981. He also served as a Texas State Representative and Texas Secretary of State before becoming a U.S. Congressman.\n\nHe and his wife, Imelda, and two daughters live in Laredo.\n\nWhat is Rep. Cuellar being investigated for?\n\nNBC News was the first to report about the expected indictment, stating that Cuellar and his wife are being charged with bribery and money laundering in connection to an Azerbaijani oil and gas company.\n\nNBC News reported that \"The Cuellars allegedly accepted roughly $600,000 in bribes from the two foreign entities in exchange for the congressman performing official acts.\"\n\nThe FBI executed a search warrant at Cuellar's home and campaign office in 2022 but it is unclear if any potential federal charges are related to the raid. Cuellar serves as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nHis lawyer Joshua Berman said in April that he was informed by the feds that Cuellar was not the focus of the investigation.\n\nWhat did Rep. Cuellar say about the indictment?\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar said in a statement to USA TODAY, indicating his wife Imelda, is also involved.\n\n\"Proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" he said. \"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side.\"\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, swiftly responded to reports of an imminent criminal indictment and urged House Democrats to call on their colleague to resign.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar does not put Texas first, he puts himself first,\" Delanie Bomar, a spokesperson for the NRCC said in a statement. \"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign.

Henry Cuellar and his wife allegedly took nearly $600,000 in bribes, indictment says - WSVN 7News | Miami News, Weather, Sports | Fort Lauderdale", "body": "(CNN) -- Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife have been charged with accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities, according to an indictment in federal court in Texas.\n\nThe alleged scheme took place from late 2014 through at least November 2021, the indictment says.\n\nThe congressman and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, made their initial court appearance on Friday in Houston and were released on a $100,000 bond. They are facing several charges, including conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official, violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal and money laundering.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Cuellar said: \"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nCuellar said in his statement that actions he took in Congress were \"in the interest of the American people\" and vowed to continue his bid for reelection in November. The congressman also defended his wife, saying that, \"The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive.\"\n\n\"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people,\" Cuellar said.\n\nProsecutors say that Henry and Imelda Cuellar crafted two yearslong schemes to get bribes from foreign entities - an oil and gas company \"wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Azerbaijan, and a bank headquartered in Mexico City.\"\n\nIn exchange for bribe payments from the Azerbaijan oil company, Cuellar \"agreed to perform official acts in his capacity as a Member of Congress, to commit acts in violation of his official duties, and to act as an agent of the Government of Azerbaijan\" and the bank, the indictment says.\n\nAmong those promises, prosecutors allege Cuellar agreed to influence US policy through a \"series of legislative measures relating to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia,\" by giving a pro-Azerbaijani speech on the House floor, inserting language \"favored by Azerbaijan\" into legislation and committee reports, and advocating for \"series of legislative measures relating to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia.\"\n\nThe Texas Democrat also allegedly promised to influence financial regulations in a way that would benefit the Mexican bank and its affiliates, including by working to pressure the Executive Branch on anti-money laundering enforcement practices that \"threatened\" their business interest and supporting revisions to the criminal money-laundering statutes.\n\nThe couple received the bribe payments through shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, prosecutors say. They allegedly used the proceeds from the bribery schemes to pay taxes, pay down debt and spend tens of thousands of dollars at restaurants and retail stores. One purchase was for a $12,000 custom gown, according to the indictment.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo, Texas, were raided by the FBI in 2022. The charges against Cuellar are not yet publicly available.\n\nA spokesperson for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a statement shortly after Cuellar's charges were reported, saying that the congressman is entitled to the presumption of innocence. But, spokesperson Christie Stephenson said, Cuellar will temporarily step down from his top spot on a House Appropriations Subcommittee while the investigation is ongoing.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus. Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Stephenson said.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee swiftly called on Cuellar to resign.\n\n\"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not -- they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" Delanie Bomar, a spokesperson for the NRCC, said in a statement.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But he sure didn't act like the actions he took on behalf of Azerbaijan were on the up and up.\n\nThe couple received payments from Azerbaijan through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and her two children, according to the indictment. The $25,000 a month was paid out under a \"sham contract\" in exchange for \"unspecified consulting services\" according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment states.\n\nImelda Cuellar would send a false invoice to the Washington office of the Azerbaijani energy company stating the work she contracted for was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imelda Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nThe indictment also alleges an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as \"el Jefe\" or \"boss,\" and also that a member of Cuellar's staff sent multiple emails to officials at the Department of State pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation. That search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington, D.C., and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nCuellar also agreed to a series of straight-up \"pay for play\" agreements with Azerbaijan.\n\nCNN:\n\nAmong those promises, prosecutors allege Cuellar agreed to influence US policy through a \"series of legislative measures relating to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia,\" by giving a pro-Azerbaijani speech on the House floor, inserting language \"favored by Azerbaijan\" into legislation and committee reports, and advocating for \"series of legislative measures relating to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia.\"\n\nThe Texas Democrat also allegedly promised to influence financial regulations in a way that would benefit the Mexican bank and its affiliates, including by working to pressure the Executive Branch on anti-money laundering enforcement practices that \"threatened\" their business interest and supporting revisions to the criminal money-laundering statutes.\n\nAccording to the Corruption Index of Transparency International, Azerbaijan is ranked 153 out of 180 nations. Cuellar was in bed with some very bad people.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_moran@pjmedia.com", "name": "Rick Moran", "type":

He represents a Texas district that borders Mexico and includes Laredo and parts of San Antonio.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Cuellar would be stepping down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee while the case is pending.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo were searched by federal law enforcement in January 2022, when Cuellar served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn that capacity, he and several other members of Congress signed a letter urging Congress to provide humanitarian support to assist people displaced following the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe indictment cited Cuellar's support for providing funding to Azerbaijan and a pro-Azerbaijan speech he gave on the House floor, among other actions.\n\nCuellar said in his statement he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm.\n\n\"We

They are facing several charges, including conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official, violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal and money laundering.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Cuellar said: \"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nCuellar said in his statement that actions he took in Congress were \"in the interest of the American people\" and vowed to continue his bid for reelection in November. The congressman also defended his wife, saying that, \"The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive.\"\n\n\"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people,\" Cuellar said.\n\nProsecutors say that Henry and Imelda Cuellar crafted two yearslong schemes to get bribes from foreign entities - an oil and gas company \"wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Azerbaijan, and a bank headquartered in Mexico City.\"\n\nIn exchange for bribe payments from the Azerbaijan oil company, Cuellar \"agreed to perform official acts in his capacity as a Member of Congress, to commit acts in violation of his official duties, and to act as an agent of the Government of Azerbaijan\" and the bank, the indictment says.\n\nAmong those promises, prosecutors allege Cuellar agreed to influence US policy through a \"series of legislative measures relating to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia,\" by giving a pro-Azerbaijani speech on the House floor, inserting language \"favored by Azerbaijan\" into legislation and committee reports, and advocating for \"series of legislative measures relating to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia.\"\n\nThe Texas Democrat also allegedly promised to influence financial regulations in a way that would benefit the Mexican bank and its affiliates, including by working to pressure the Executive Branch on anti-money laundering enforcement practices that \"threatened\" their business interest and supporting revisions to the criminal money-laundering statutes.\n\nThe couple received the bribe payments through shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, prosecutors say. They allegedly used the proceeds from the bribery schemes to pay taxes, pay down debt and spend tens of thousands of dollars at restaurants and retail stores. One purchase was for a $12,000 custom gown, according to the indictment.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo, Texas, were raided by the FBI in 2022. The charges against Cuellar are not yet publicly available.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a statement shortly after Cuellar's charges were reported, saying that the congressman is entitled to the presumption of innocence. But, Jeffries said, Cuellar will temporarily step down from his top spot on a House Appropriations Subcommittee while the investigation is ongoing.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus. Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Jeffries said.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee swiftly called on Cuellar to resign.\n\n\"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not -- they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" Delanie Bomar, a spokesperson for the NRCC, said in a statement.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Henry Cuellar and his wife were indicted for allegedly accepting close to $600,000 in bribes in two schemes meant to benefit an Azerbaijani state-owned energy company and an unnamed bank based in Mexico, court papers showed.\n\nThe indictment, returned by a grand jury on Tuesday and unsealed on Friday, said the bribes were laundered through sham consulting contracts into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, the congressman's wife, from December 2014 through at least November 2021.\n\nIn exchange, it says Henry Cuellar sought to use his public position to influence U.S. foreign policy in Azerbaijan's favor and to pressure U.S. government officials to help the Mexican bank lobby against anti-money laundering enforcement policies and payday lending regulations that threatened its business.\n\nBefore the charges were unsealed, Cuellar issued a statement denying the allegations.\n\n\"Both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" said Cuellar.\n\nOne of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, Cuellar is seeking an 11th two-year term in the Nov. 5 election. He represents a Texas district that borders Mexico and includes Laredo and parts of San Antonio.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Cuellar would be stepping down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee while the case is pending.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo were searched by federal law enforcement in January 2022, when Cuellar served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn that capacity, he and several other members of Congress signed a letter urging Congress to provide humanitarian support to assist people displaced following the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe indictment cited Cuellar's support for providing funding to Azerbaijan and a pro-Azerbaijan speech he gave on the House floor, among other actions.\n\nCuellar said in his statement he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm.\n\n\"We requested a meeting with the Washington DC prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side,\" he added.\n\nThe Justice Department said Cuellar and his wife made initial appearances before a federal magistrate judge in Houston on Friday. They were released on bond.\n\nEach faces 14 counts on charges including conspiracy, bribery, honest services wire fraud, being a public official acting as an agent of a foreign principal, and money laundering.\n\nSeveral of the charges carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison.\n\nCuellar is not the only member of Congress facing federal charges.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bob Menendez is awaiting trial on corruption charges in New York, while Republican George Santos last year was expelled from the House while he awaits trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws.\n\nBoth Menendez and Santos deny wrongdoing.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, asserted his innocence in a statement Friday after NBC News reported federal investigators were planning to indict the long-time congressman.\n\nThe nature of the potential indictment remains unclear. FBI agents raideded Cuellar's Laredo home and office in 2022 -- weeks before his primary election -- though his lawyer at the time asserted he was not the target of the investigation. ABC News reported shortly after that the investigation was related to Cuellar, his wife and one of his campaign staffers and their alleged ties to Azerbaijan. Cuellar is a member of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn his Friday statement, Cuellar said his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar said without addressing what the allegations were about. \"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nThe Texas Tribune and several national news organizations asked a federal court to unseal the search warrant in 2022.\n\nCuellar added that he will still run for reelection in November.\n\nThe 2022 search on Cuellar's home came only a few months before a competitive primary against progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros, a Laredo-based immigration attorney. He ended up winning in the primary by 0.6 percentage points.\n\nCuellar is the fourth-longest serving Democrat in the Texas delegation and is an established fixture in the House Democratic Caucus. He is known for his centrist policy priorities, including votes reflecting his personal aversion to abortion and in support of stricter border security.\n\nHe is also a major proponent of the oil and gas industry, which is responsible for a large part of his district's economy. Azerbaijan is a major oil and gas producer.\n\nStill, he is well respected within the Democratic Caucus for his prolific fundraising and reliability on major votes that count. Democratic leadership under Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Cuellar when Cisneros challenged him in the 2020 and 2022 primaries. Cuellar won in both primaries and the 2022 general election, despite heavy investment from Republicans to flip South Texas. He beat his 2022 Republican opponent, Cassy Garcia, by over 13 points.\n\nTwo Republican challengers will face off in a May 28 runoff for the chance to challenge Cuellar in the general: Jay Furman and Lazaro Garzo. After Cuellar's 2022 win, Republicans have considered the district less competitive and are investing more heavily in the nearby Rio Grande Valley-based 15th and 34th districts.", "source": {"uri":

This year, two Republican candidates face each other in a runoff election on May 28 for the opportunity to race against Cuellar in November. Though his seat is rated \"likely Democratic\" by Cook Political Report, an indictment could slim his reelection chances.\n\nA member of the House's centrist Blue Dogs and New Democrat Coalitions, Cuellar came to Congress in 2004. He is the sole House Democrat who opposes abortion rights, a flashpoint for several members of his own party.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Henry Cuellar has stood out as a moderate Democrat along the Texas-Mexico border, bucking his party at times over guns and immigration while seldom facing a tough reelection.\n\nBut a federal indictment accusing Cuellar of federal conspiracy and bribery charges is putting the Laredo native who was first elected in 2004 in a different spotlight. Cuellar, 68, and his wife, Imelda, 67, were taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe congressman professed his innocence after the indictment was revealed and vowed to continue his bid for an 11th term in November, saying, \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nThe Cuellars are accused of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar allegedly agreed to advance those entities' interests in the U.S.\n\nThe couple surrendered to authorities, made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nCuellar's family is a political fixture along the border: His brother is the sheriff in Laredo, and his sister, a former municipal judge, is also on the ballot this year, running as a Democratic candidate for state representative.\n\nSeveral of Cuellar's allies in the district, which stretches from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio suburbs, expressed surprise over the indictments, but said they would still support his reelection. Cuellar's moderate politics have helped him maintain support in places where Democrats have lost ground, like Starr County, a rural and agricultural part of South Texas.\n\n\"It is extremely surprising for me because I've known Henry for many, many years,\" Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said. \"He's always been a very straight guy, you know, very sincere. I mean, he's done so much for us in Starr County. I hate to see this going on.\"\n\nSylvia Bruni, chair of nearby Webb County's Democratic Party, said she would trust the legal system to work fairly and her focus would remain on elections. \"We have a campaign to advance, our Democracy at stake,\" she said in a statement.\n\nCuellar released a statement Friday saying he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they could be punished with up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment.

In 2020 and 2022, Jessica Cisneros staged a primary challenger against him, sending him to a runoff, in which he prevailed both times.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership has consistently backed him and belive that he is the only Democrat who can win in the heavily conservative and Latino Rio Grande Valley. In his most recent primary in March, he ran unopposed.\n\nMr Cuellar has also sharply criticised other Democrats for their policies on immigration and started a coterie of Democrats who support stronger measures called Democrats for Border Security Task Force.\n\nHe was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nMr Cuellar's family also has a prominent presence in the district. His brother is the sheriff of Webb County while his sister served as a judge for Rio Bravo and Webb County. His concentration of power has earned him the nickname \"the King Laredo,\" where he lives.\n\nIn 2022, the FBI raided Mr Cuellar's congressional office in Laredo and his home. His attorney at that time said the congressman was not the target of that investigation.\n\nThat search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington DC, and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press.\n\nFederal disclosures show that the nine-term congressman traveled to Azerbaijan in 2013. Two years later, Mr Cuellar's office announced an agreement between a Texas university and an organization called the Assembly of Friends of Azerbaijan for the purposes of collaborating on oil and gas research and education.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the raids in 2022, Mr Cuellar went on to beat back a left-wing Democratic challenger - Jessica Cisneros - for the second time.\n\nA year after the raid on his home the congressman told the Texas Tribune: \"There has been no wrongdoing on my part... My focus remains the same from my very first day in office: delivering results for Texans across my district.\"\n\nMr Cuellar has previously been undaunted by the controversy and has previously vowed to seek reelection to Congress in November, which would be his 11th term.\n\nFollowing the announcement of charges, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that the congressman was \"entitled to his day in court.\"\n\n\"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus. Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" a statement from Mr Jeffries read.\n\n\"Pursuant to House Democratic Caucus Rule 24, Congressman Cuellar will take leave as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while this matter is ongoing.\"\n\nIn contrast, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) wrote in a brief post on X: \"Cuellar does not put Texas first, he puts himself first.

Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said in a statement that did not elaborate on what he was accused of.\n\nHe added that \"I'm running for re-election and will win this November,\" when Democrats are hoping to regain the majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nHis comments came after NBC News, citing two unnamed sources, reported federal charges would soon be announced against the lawmaker, who has represented a swath of Texas's border with Mexico in Congress's lower chamber since 2005. It was not clear what Cuellar was being charged with.\n\nTwo years ago, the FBI raided Cuellar's Laredo, Texas, home and campaign office as part of an investigation into US businessmen and links with Azerbaijan. At the time, the congressman said he would cooperate fully with the FBI, but it remains unclear if Cuellar's expected indictment was related to that search. Months later, an attorney for Cuellar told Fox News that the congressman was not a target of the investigation that led to the raid.\n\nIn his statement on Friday, the congressman said that \"before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm. The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\" He did not elaborate on what action he was referring to, or how his wife, Imelda Cuellar, was involved.\n\nCuellar added that he had requested to meet with \"the Washington, DC prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side\".\n\nFederal charges could complicate the re-election of 68-year-old Cuellar, who is seeking an 11th term in office. A moderate Democrat, he supported a bipartisan Senate bill that would have tightened immigration policy, and is the party's sole House lawmaker opposed to passing federal legislation to guarantee abortion access.\n\nAfter the 2022 raid on his home and office, Cuellar narrowly won the Democratic primary against his progressive challenger, Jessica Cisneros, then easily beat Republican Cassy Garcia in the general election.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar",

Henry Cuellar of Texas vows to continue his bid for an 11th term despite bribery indictment", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- For two decades, U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar has stood out as a moderate Democrat along the Texas-Mexico border, bucking his party at times over guns and immigration while seldom facing a tough reelection.\n\nBut a federal indictment accusing Cuellar of federal conspiracy and bribery charges is putting the Laredo native who was first elected in 2004 in a different spotlight. Cuellar, 68, and his wife, Imelda, 67, were taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe congressman professed his innocence after the indictment was revealed and vowed to continue his bid for an 11th term in November, saying, \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nThe Cuellars are accused of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar allegedly agreed to advance those entities' interests in the U.S.\n\nThe couple surrendered to authorities, made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nCuellar's family is a political fixture along the border: His brother is the sheriff in Laredo, and his sister, a former municipal judge, is also on the ballot this year, running as a Democratic candidate for state representative.\n\nSeveral of Cuellar's allies in the district, which stretches from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio suburbs, expressed surprise over the indictments but said they would still support his reelection. Cuellar's moderate politics have helped him maintain support in places where Democrats have lost ground, like Starr County, a rural and agricultural part of South Texas.\n\n\"It is extremely surprising for me because I've known Henry for many, many years,\" Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said. \"He's always been a very straight guy, you know, very sincere. I mean, he's done so much for us in Starr County. I hate to see this going on.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Starr County by a slim, single-digit margin. Two years later, Cuellar won it by 40%.\n\nSylvia Bruni, chair of nearby Webb County's Democratic Party, said she would trust the legal system to work fairly and her focus would remain on elections. \"We have a campaign to advance, our Democracy at stake,\" she said in a statement.\n\nCuellar released a statement Friday saying he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they could be punished with up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a \"sham contract,\" purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment says.\n\nImelda Cuellar is alleged to have sent a falsified invoice to the energy company's Washington, D.C., office under the agreement, saying her work was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imelda Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nThe indictment alleges that an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as both \"el Jefe\" and \"boss,\" and also that a member of Cuellar's staff sent multiple emails to officials at the State Department pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022. Cuellar has been among his party's loudest critics of Biden, particularly over the administration's response to a record number of migrant crossings on the border. His moderate politics have aligned him at times with Republicans on issues including abortion and guns. ___\n\nGonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas.

Henry Cuellar Indicted on Charges of Bribery and Money Laundering", "body": "WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a powerful South Texas Democrat, was indicted with his wife Imelda on Friday on charges of accepting almost $600,000 in bribes from Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank.\n\nCuellar allegedly accepted the payments from Azerbaijan's state-run oil and gas company after they had been laundered through fake consulting contracts to shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, according to the indictment. In exchange, the Laredo congressman allegedly pushed U.S. policy in favor of Azerbaijan, an oil-rich former Soviet country that borders Iran and Russia on the Caspian sea. That includes adding language to defense spending legislation to prioritize ties to countries in the region, including with Azerbaijan, and working to kill legislation prioritized by members who supported Armenian interests.\n\nCuellar also allegedly took money from a retail Mexican bank and influenced members of the executive branch to work around an anti-money laundering policy that threatened the bank's interests, according to the indictment. Cuellar also allegedly coordinated with a subsidiary of the bank on legislation that would have been beneficial to the payday lending industry -- a form of lending usually targeting low income borrowers with few alternatives that includes extremely high interest rates.\n\nThe indictment said Cuellar and his wife used the money to finance credit card payments, taxes, car payments, dining and shopping, including $12,000 on a custom gown. It also said one of the Cuellars' adult children assisted in the creation of the sham shell companies used to launder funds. The Cuellars have two adult children: Christy and Catie.\n\nThe charges include bribery, money laundering, working on behalf of a foreign government and conspiracy. The indictment alleges Cuellar recruited family, friends and his former campaign manager to facilitate the payments. If convicted and given the maximum sentence, Cuellar could face decades in prison.\n\nCuellar quickly asserted his innocence in a statement Friday minutes after NBC News reported federal prosecutors' plans for an indictment. The Cuellars appeared in a federal courthouse in Houston on Friday over the charges.\n\nCuellar said his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar said. \"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the House Ethics Committee declined to comment on Friday.\n\nFBI agents raided Cuellar's Laredo home and office in 2022 -- just weeks before his competitive primary election. His lawyer at the time asserted he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nHe ended up winning in the 2022 primary against Jessica Cisneros, a Laredo-based immigration attorney by 0.6 percentage points, and sailing to victory in the general election virtually unscathed by the police raid.\n\nCuellar is up for reelection again this year. He was unopposed in the primary. Two Republican challengers will face off in a May 28 runoff for the chance to challenge Cuellar in the general: Jay Furman and Lazaro Garza.\n\nCuellar said in his Friday statement that he will still run for reelection in November.\n\nCuellar is a member of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus and has been a fervent advocate for the country's interests in Congress.\n\nHe traveled to Turkey and Azerbaijan on a $25,000 trip with his wife Imelda in 2013, paid for by the Turquoise Council of Americans and Eurasians. Shortly after, a Cuellar staffer went on another trip to Azerbaijan with several members, including Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, that was also facilitated by the group.\n\nAfter his 2013 trip, agents working on behalf of the Azerbaijani government recruited Cuellar to work with them on U.S. policy helping their country, according to the indictment.\n\nThe group that hosted Cuellar's trip is based in Texas and was led by Kemal Oksuz, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to partaking in the coverup of the Azerbaijani's government's role financing the 2013 congressional trip that included Jackson Lee. Oksuz admitted to lying in disclosures to the House Ethics Committee on the source of funding for the trip, which came from the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic.\n\nAfter Oksuz's guilty plea, payments from SOCAR to the Cuellar's paused, according to the indictment.\n\nOksuz also worked with Cuellar to establish a program for Texas A&M International University students to study energy issues in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. ExxonMobil and the Azerbaijani government were also involved in the creation of the program.\n\nAzerbaijan is known for lavish spending on foreign lawmakers to advance its interests. The country has reportedly spent billions on treating European lawmakers in a practice derisively known as \"caviar diplomacy.\" The country spends about half a million dollars a year on lobbying in Washington, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nAzerbaijan has had interest in influencing Western governments due to tense relations with its neighbors. The country had been engaged in a long-running border dispute with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave made up of largely ethnic Armenians, until Azerbaijan forcibly retook control of the territory last year. The dispute had been a significant roadblock to peace in the region since the fall of the Soviet Union, with European, American and Russian governments struggling with the issues for decades.\n\nCuellar coordinated with Azerbaijani diplomats to eliminate legislation that would finance land mine clearing in Nagorno-Karabakh in 2017, according to the indictment, citing text messages between Cuellar and the diplomat. He also wrote to a U.S. official in 2016 accusing Armenia of being a \"proxy\" of Russia, urging the U.S. to push for the withdrawal of pro-Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nThe eventual take over of the region by Azerbaijan led to the rapid evacuation of thousands of ethnic Armenians over fears the Azerbaijani government would commit ethnic cleansing.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last year that the administration was \"deeply concerned\" with Azerbaijan's aggression in the region and that \"the use of force to resolve disputes is unacceptable and runs counter to efforts to create conditions for a just and dignified peace.\"\n\nCuellar also allegedly included language to an annual defense spending bill in 2014 directing the secretaries of state and defense to work on a \"strategic framework for United States security force assistance and cooperation in the European and Eurasian regions,\" including Azerbaijan. He also coordinated with an Azerbaijani diplomat on a meeting with the Defense Department to focus more U.S. defense policy on the region, according to the indictment.\n\n\"Thank you Congressman! This is good indeed,\" the diplomat said in an email to Cuellar cited in the indictment.\n\nCuellar and his wife are also accused of accepting bribes in exchange for advancing policies that would help a Mexican commercial bank's business interests. Using a Mexican government official as an intermediary, the Cuellars allegedly received over $200,000 in bribes from the bank, according to the indictment.\n\nCuellar allegedly wrote to officials at the Treasury Department to set up mechanisms to help cross-border transactions crucial to the bank's business. After federal law went into effect designed at stopping money laundering, many U.S. financial institutions pulled back partnerships with Mexican banks due to the high risk of illicit transactions.\n\nLike with the Azerbaijani case, the arrangement involved fake consulting fees paid to a shell company operated by Imelda Cuellar, the indictment said. The Cuellars allegedly negotiated the agreement with the bank around the same time they were setting up their transactions with the Azerbaijanis.\n\nAt one point, the Cuellars used Henry Cuellar's campaign manager and former chief of staff as an intermediary to disguise the payments, according to the indictment. The indictment does not identify the campaign manager by name, but notes the person was a resident of Buda, Texas.\n\nCuellar also allegedly tipped off the vice chairman of the Mexican bank of a bill that would pause the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from making new regulations on the payday lending industry for two years. Cuellar then coordinated with a U.S.-based subsidiary of the Mexican bank on language in defense of the bill. The subsidiary was a payday lending company.\n\nCuellar and his family have been political fixtures in Laredo and Webb County for decades, dating back to 1987, when Cuellar began a 14-year stint representing the area in the Texas House.\n\nHe was elected to Congress in 2004, a few years before his brother, Martin Cuellar, ousted the incumbent Webb County sheriff -- a position he still holds today. Cuellar's sister, Rosie Cuellar, previously served as Webb County tax assessor-collector. She is seeking the Democratic nomination for an open Texas House seat that covers part of Laredo and Webb County, a contest that will be decided later this month in a May 28 primary runoff.\n\nCuellar and his wife have been married for 32 years, he said in his statement.\n\n\"On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees,\" he said in his Friday statement. \"The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive. The allegations have been difficult on my family. But, with your prayers, we will overcome.\"\n\nToday, Cuellar is the fourth-longest serving Democrat in the Texas delegation and is an established fixture in the House Democratic Caucus. He is known for occasionally crossing the aisle to vote with Republicans, especially on border security. He is the only Democrat in the House who opposes abortion rights.\n\nHe is also a major proponent of the oil and gas industry, which is responsible for a large part of his district's economy. Azerbaijan is a major oil and gas producer.\n\nStill, he is well respected within the Democratic Caucus for his prolific fundraising and reliability on major votes that count. Democratic leadership under Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Cuellar when Cisneros challenged him in the 2020 and 2022 primaries. Cuellar won in both primaries and the 2022 general election, despite heavy investment from Republicans to flip South Texas. He beat his 2022 Republican opponent, Cassy Garcia, by over 13 points.\n\nAfter Cuellar's 2022 win, Republicans have considered the district less competitive and are investing more heavily in the nearby Rio Grande Valley-based 15th and 34th districts.\n\nThe Republicans running to unseat him the November were quick to pounce on the Friday indictment.\n\nFurman issued a video statement, blasting Cuellar as being part of an establishment that is \"selling us to other nations.\"\n\n\"They're trading us for their deep pockets and their forever policies that are against the values of South Texas,\" Furman said. \"Exciting that maybe one of them will get their due.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Garza said: \"There is no place for corruption in Congress!\"\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee also called on Cuellar to resign.\n\n\"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" NRCC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said in a statement.\n\nSome Texas Democrats have already done so for another longtime lawmaker who was recently indicted. After the Justice Department charged Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, on several counts of corruption and bribery related to his ties to Egypt, a handful of Texas members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus called for his resignation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement that Cuellar deserved a fair trial and the \"presumption of innocence throughout the legal process.\" Jeffries said Cuellar would forfeit his position atop the Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security. House Democratic rules require a committee chair to step down if they are indicted on a crime with a possible prison sentence of more than two years.\n\nJasper Scherer contributed to this report.",

Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, asserted his innocence in a statement Friday after NBC News reported federal investigators were planning to indict the longtime congressman.\n\nThe nature of the potential indictment remains unclear, though Cuellar's statement suggests his wife is also a target. FBI agents raided Cuellar's Laredo home and office in 2022 -- just weeks before his competitive primary election. His lawyer at the time asserted he was not the target of the investigation. ABC News reported shortly after that the investigation was related to Cuellar, his wife and one of his campaign staffers and their alleged ties to Azerbaijan. Cuellar is a member of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus and has been a fervent advocate for the country's interests in Congress.\n\nIn his Friday statement, Cuellar said his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar said without addressing what the allegations were about. \"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the House Ethics Committee declined to comment on Friday.\n\nThe Texas Tribune and several national news organizations asked a federal court to unseal the search warrant in 2022.\n\nCuellar traveled to Azerbaijan on a $25,000 trip with his wife Imelda in 2013, paid for by the Turquoise Council of Americans and Eurasians. Shortly after, a Cuellar staffer went on another trip to Azerbaijan with several members, including Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, that was also facilitated by the group.\n\nThe group is based in Texas and was led by Kemal Oksuz, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to partaking in the coverup of the Azerbaijani's government's role financing the 2013 congressional trip that included Jackson Lee. Oksuz admitted to lying in disclosures to the House Ethics Committee on the source of funding for the trip, which came from the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic.\n\nOksuz also worked with Cuellar to establish a program for Texas A&M International University students to study energy issues in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. ExxonMobil and the Azerbaijani government were also involved in the creation of the program.\n\nAzerbaijan is known for lavish spending on foreign lawmakers to advance its interests. The country has reportedly spent billions on treating European lawmakers in a practice derisively known as \"caviar diplomacy.\" The country spends about half a million dollars a year on lobbying in Washington, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nThe 2022 search by federal investigators on Cuellar's home came only a few weeks before a competitive primary against progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros, a Laredo-based immigration attorney. He ended up winning in the primary by 0.6 percentage points.\n\nCuellar said in his Friday statement that he will still run for reelection in November.\n\nCuellar is the fourth-longest serving Democrat in the Texas delegation and is an established fixture in the House Democratic Caucus. He is known for occasionally crossing the aisle to vote with Republicans, including votes reflecting his personal aversion to abortion and in support of stricter border security. He is the only Democrat in the House who opposes abortion rights.\n\nHe is also a major proponent of the oil and gas industry, which is responsible for a large part of his district's economy. Azerbaijan is a major oil and gas producer.\n\nStill, he is well respected within the Democratic Caucus for his prolific fundraising and reliability on major votes that count. Democratic leadership under Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Cuellar when Cisneros challenged him in the 2020 and 2022 primaries. Cuellar won in both primaries and the 2022 general election, despite heavy investment from Republicans to flip South Texas. He beat his 2022 Republican opponent, Cassy Garcia, by over 13 points.\n\nAfter Cuellar's 2022 win, Republicans have considered the district less competitive and are investing more heavily in the nearby Rio Grande Valley-based 15th and 34th districts. Two Republican challengers will face off in a May 28 runoff for the chance to challenge Cuellar in the general: Jay Furman and Lazaro Garza.\n\nFurman issued a video statement shortly after the news of an potential indictment, blasting Cuellar as being part of an establishment that is \"selling us to other nations.\"\n\n\"They're trading us for their deep pockets and their forever policies that are against the values of South Texas,\" Furman said. \"Exciting that maybe one of them will get their due.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Garza said: \"There is no place for corruption in Congress!\"\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee also called on Cuellar to resign.\n\n\"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" NRCC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said in a statement.\n\nSome Texas Democrats have already done so for another longtime lawmaker who was recently indicted. After the Justice Department charged Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, on several counts of corruption and bribery related to his ties to Egypt, a handful of Texas members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus called for his resignation.\n\nWe've got big things in store for you at The Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 5-7 in downtown Austin.

nearly $600,000 in bribes through two schemes aimed at benefiting an Azerbaijani state-owned energy company and an unnamed Mexican bank.\n\nCourt documents revealed that the bribes were funneled through fake consulting contracts into shell companies owned by Cuellar's wife, Imelda Cuellar, spanning from December 2014 to at least November 2021.\n\nThe indictment suggests that Henry Cuellar leveraged his public position to sway U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan and to lobby against anti-money laundering policies and payday lending regulations on behalf of the Mexican bank.\n\nCuellar vehemently denied the allegations before the charges were unsealed, asserting his and his wife's innocence.\n\nKnown as one of the more conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, Cuellar is campaigning for his 11th consecutive term, representing a Texas district encompassing Laredo and parts of San Antonio, which borders Mexico.\n\nIn light of the indictment, Cuellar will step down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee, according to a spokesperson for Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nThe indictment follows federal law enforcement searches of Cuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo in January 2022, coinciding with his role as co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe indictment highlights Cuellar's advocacy for funding to Azerbaijan and a pro-Azerbaijan speech he delivered on the House floor, among other actions.\n\nCuellar asserted that he was seeking legal guidance from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm but lamented the refusal of Washington DC prosecutors to engage with him.\n\nCuellar and his wife made initial appearances before a federal magistrate judge in Houston and were released on bond.\n\nThey face 14 charges, including conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud, acting as a public official for a foreign principal, and money laundering, with potential prison sentences of up to 20 years for some charges.\n\nCuellar joins a short list of congressional members facing federal charges amid ongoing claims of innocence from both parties.",

Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) and his wife allegedly accepted $600,000 in bribes from an oil company controlled by the Azerbaijan government and a bank headquartered in Mexico, according to a federal indictment unsealed in Texas on Friday.\n\nThe 68-year-old congressman and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, are accused of setting up front companies that entered into sham contracts with the two entities, the indictment said.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Cuellar agreed to use his position as a congressman to positively influence U.S. foreign policies for Azerbaijan. In exchange for the Mexican bank bribes, Cuellar agreed to push policies that would benefit the bank, the indictment said.\n\nBoth husband and wife face charges that include money laundering, conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official, wire fraud and more.\n\nCuellar said in a statement that he is innocent and expects to win his reelection bid in November.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement comes two years after Cuellar's home and office in Laredo, Tex., were raided by FBI agents as part of an investigation that authorities never publicly disclosed. Cuellar's lawyers maintained that the Justice Department told them the congressman was not the subject of the probe.\n\nCuellar had said he was cooperating in the investigation. He pledged in 2022 not to abandon his bid for reelection, winning his 10th term in Congress that November. He is running again this cycle.\n\nCuellar has served in the House for almost two decades and has been critical of the Democratic Party over what he says has been a shift to the left over the years. He proudly wears the moderate Democrat label and has often sought to work across the aisle.\n\nRepresenting a district bordering the Texas-Mexico border that's anchored around his hometown of Laredo, Cuellar has pushed the Democratic caucus over the years to seek moderate and bipartisan solutions to the border crisis, often siding with proposals made by then-President Donald Trump. Many liberals consider him a thorn in Democrats' side, complicating efforts to advance the border issue in a way most of the caucus wants to pursue.\n\nCuellar is also the last remaining House Democrat who is antiabortion. He often sides with Republicans on more conservative legislation. His more moderate stances have earned him primary challenges in recent years, including two by liberal Jessica Cisneros, who came close to ousting him shortly after the 2022 FBI raid.\n\nIn recent months, Cuellar made headlines after he was carjacked last year about a mile from the U.S. Capitol.

Henry Cuellar accused of taking bribes from Azerbaijan, Mexican bank", "body": "Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, and his wife allegedly accepted $600,000 in bribes from an oil company controlled by the Azerbaijan government and a bank headquartered in Mexico, according to a federal indictment unsealed in Texas on Friday.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, speaks during a hearing of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations April 10 in Washington. Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press, file\n\nThe 68-year-old congressman and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, are accused of setting up front companies that entered into sham contracts with the two entities, the indictment said.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Cuellar agreed to use his position as a congressman to positively influence U.S. foreign policies for Azerbaijan. In exchange for the Mexican bank bribes, Cuellar agreed to push policies that would benefit the bank, the indictment said.\n\nBoth husband and wife face charges that include money laundering, conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official, wire fraud and more.\n\nCuellar said in a statement that he is innocent and expects to win his reelection bid in November.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement comes two years after Cuellar's home and office in Laredo were raided by FBI agents as part of an investigation that authorities never publicly disclosed. Cuellar's lawyers maintained that the Justice Department told them the congressman was not the subject of the probe.\n\nCuellar had said he was cooperating in the investigation. He pledged in 2022 not to abandon his bid for reelection, winning his 10th term in Congress that November. He is running again this cycle.\n\nCuellar has served in the House for almost two decades and has been critical of the Democratic Party over what he says has been a shift to the left over the years. He proudly wears the moderate Democrat label and has often sought to work across the aisle.\n\nRepresenting a district bordering the Texas-Mexico border that's anchored around his hometown of Laredo, Cuellar has pushed the Democratic caucus over the years to seek moderate and bipartisan solutions to the border crisis, often siding with proposals made by then-President Donald Trump. Many liberals consider him a thorn in Democrats' side, complicating efforts to advance the border issue in a way most of the caucus wants to pursue.\n\nCuellar is also the last remaining House Democrat who is antiabortion. He often sides with Republicans on more conservative legislation. His more moderate stances have earned him primary challenges in recent years, including two by liberal Jessica Cisneros, who came close to ousting him shortly after the 2022 FBI raid.\n\nIn recent months, Cuellar made headlines after he was carjacked last year about a mile from the U.S. Capitol. His car and luggage were stolen.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: mexico, U.S. Congress Related Stories

That included records related to Cuellar and his wife, according to ABC News.\n\nCuellar is a former co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijani Caucus and in that role met with Azerbaijani officials.", "source": {"uri": "upi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Congressional_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Republican Congressional Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-Soviet states"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6751714755910/2024/upi/3ce926a7d202a70b0f02b3b700a7fd27/v2.1/Texas-Rep-Henry-Cuellar-proclaims-innocence-as-unspecified-indictment-expected.jpg?lg=4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537117", "eventUri": "eng-9537117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Henry Cuellar of Texas vows to continue his bid for an 11th term despite bribery indictment", "body": "WASHINGTON -- For two decades, U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar has stood out as a moderate Democrat along the Texas-Mexico border, bucking his party at times over guns and immigration while seldom facing a tough reelection.\n\nBut a federal indictment accusing Cuellar of federal conspiracy and bribery charges is putting the Laredo native who was first elected in 2004 in a different spotlight. Cuellar, 68, and his wife, Imelda, 67, were taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe congressman professed his innocence after the indictment was revealed and vowed to continue his bid for an 11th term in November, saying, \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, denies any wrongdoing amid reports of pending indictments related to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press file\n\nThe Cuellars are accused of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar allegedly agreed to advance those entities' interests in the U.S.\n\nThe couple surrendered to authorities, made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nCuellar's family is a political fixture along the border: His brother is the sheriff in Laredo, and his sister, a former municipal judge, is also on the ballot this year, running as a Democratic candidate for state representative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral of Cuellar's allies in the district, which stretches from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio suburbs, expressed surprise over the indictments but said they would still support his reelection. Cuellar's moderate politics have helped him maintain support in places where Democrats have lost ground, like Starr County, a rural and agricultural part of South Texas.\n\n\"It is extremely surprising for me because I've known Henry for many, many years,\" Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said. \"He's always been a very straight guy, you know, very sincere. I mean, he's done so much for us in Starr County. I hate to see this going on.\"\n\nPresident Biden won Starr County by a slim, single-digit margin. Two years later, Cuellar won it by 40%.\n\nSylvia Bruni, chair of nearby Webb County's Democratic Party, said she would trust the legal system to work fairly and her focus would remain on elections. \"We have a campaign to advance, our Democracy at stake,\" she said in a statement.\n\nCuellar released a statement Friday saying he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they could be punished with up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a \"sham contract,\" purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment says.\n\nImelda Cuellar is alleged to have sent a falsified invoice to the energy company's Washington, D.C., office under the agreement, saying her work was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imelda Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe indictment alleges that an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as both \"el Jefe\" and \"boss,\" and also that a member of Cuellar's staff sent multiple emails to officials at the State Department pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022. Cuellar has been among his party's loudest critics of Biden, particularly over the administration's response to a record number of migrant crossings on the border. His moderate politics have aligned him at times with Republicans on issues including abortion and guns.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Henry Cuellar of Texas on Friday, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News.\n\nDetails of the indictment, including how many charges Cueller faces and the nature of the allegations, were not immediately available. NBC News first reported the anticipated indictment.\n\nCuellar indicated in a statement that he and his wife were charged, and he said they are innocent of the accusations. The congressman said he will continue to seek reelection to the House in November.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" he said.\n\nThe congressman said in his statement that he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee before taking any action -- though it was not clear from the statement what actions he is referring to. The committee provided a written opinion, as well as a second one from a national law firm, he said. Cuellar and his wife also requested a meeting with prosecutors in Washington, D.C., \"to explain the facts,\" he said, but they declined to discuss the case with them.\n\nThe FBI conducted a \"court-authorized\" search of the congressman's home in Laredo and campaign office in January 2022, though Cuellar's lawyer told CBS News at the time that the congressman was not the target of a federal investigation. A source familiar with the probe said then that the activity at Cuellar's house was part of an investigation related to Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen.\n\nThe congressman's office said at the time that he was cooperating fully with the investigation, and Cuellar denied wrongdoing. It was not immediately clear whether the indictment stemmed from the search.\n\nCuellar was elected to the House in 2005 and represents the 28th Congressional District. His district stretches from San Antonio south to the U.S.-Mexico border. Considered a moderate Democrat, Cuellar faced a tough primary challenge from immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, his former intern, during the 2022 election cycle, but narrowly defeated her in a runoff election.\n\nCuellar, who is Catholic, is the only remaining self-identified \"pro-life\" Democrat in the House, as abortion rights dominate the Democratic Party.\n\nCuellar was in the news in

Cuellar, who has been in office since 2005, is a pro-life and pro-border security Democrat.\n\n'Biden just Indicted Henry Cuellar because the Respected Democrat Congressman wouldn't play Crooked Joe's Open Border game,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'He was for Border Control, so they said, \"Let's use the FBI and DOJ to take him out!\" This is the way they operate. They're a bunch of D.C. Thugs.' Two bribes, which amounted to $598,000, allegedly came from an oil and gas company owned by the Azerbaijani government and a bank headquartered in Mexico City. They were reportedly funneled through shell companies owned by Imelda.\n\n'Cuellar promised to use the power and prestige of his office to advance Azerbaijan's and Foreign Bank-1's interests in the United States,' the DOJ claimed. The pair were released on $100,000 bond on Friday. If convicted, they could each spend the rest of their lives behind bars.\n\nCuellar is the third member of Congress to be indicted this congressional term, following Rep. George Santos , R-N.Y., and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. Santos was ousted in December but Menendez remains in the Senate , though he no longer serves as Foreign Relations chairman. At least one Democrat, Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., has called on Cuellar to resign.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries declined to call on Cuellar to resign, but removed him as chair of a key funding subcommitteee. Cuellar is \"'s entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,' said Jeffries, but will 'take leave as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while this matter is ongoing.'\n\n'The bribe payments were laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. Cuellar performed little or no legitimate work under the sham contracts.' The scheme ran 'at least' from December 2014 to November 2021. The couple faces up to 204 years in prison if convicted on all counts.\n\nThe Texas Democrat 's home was raided by the FBI in January 2022 as part of an investigation into his ties to Azerbaijani businessmen. Cuellar insisted he and his wife were innocent in response to the news. 'I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations.'\n\n'The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people,' he went on. The embattled congressman said he plans to continue his campaign for reelection despite the indictment. Cuellar said he and his wife tried to meet with prosecutors and they 'refused to discuss the case or hear our side.'\n\n'Imelda and I have been married for 32 years. On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working with banking, tax and consulting. The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard-working is both wrong and offensive.' Cuellar said at the time of the raid he was cooperating with law enforcement and he did not believe he was the target of the investigation. It is not yet clear if the indictment will be related to that investigation.\n\nThe nine-term Democrat is a past co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, an obscure group dedicated to furthering relations with the oil-rich nation on the Caspian Sea. In that role, Cuellar is known to have met repeatedly with Azerbaijan officials, including the country's ambassador to the US, Elin Suleymanov.\n\nAzerbaijan has been harshly criticized in the past for bribing foreign officials and diplomats to secure its foreign policy aims and legitimize dubious election results. The practice is so common in the country that it is known there as 'caviar diplomacy,' but it is unclear whether the FBI is investigating any similar allegations in relation to Cuellar. Since 2004, Cuellar has represented a district that extends from the U.S. border with Mexico near McAllen to Laredo, and north to San Antonio's eastern outskirts.\n\nThe moderate Democrat has a seat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. Public records show that Cuellar purchased his luxurious Laredo home in 2010. The 6,000-square-foot, five-bedroom home in a gated community is valued at $825,000 currently by Realtor.com. Cuellar, who represents much of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas , has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for their handling of a surge of illegal crossings at the border.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Henry Cuellar, wife indicted on charges of bribes tied to Azerbaijan", "body": "(TEXAS) -- Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife were indicted Friday on charges of conspiracy and accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from foreign entities, the Justice Department announced.\n\nProsecutors allege Cuellar and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, began accepting the roughly $600,000 in bribes beginning as early as December of 2014 from an oil and gas company owned by Azerbaijan's government as well as a bank headquartered in Mexico City.\n\nWhile Cuellar's wife allegedly propped up sham front companies on the promise of providing consulting services to the two companies in order to launder the payments, she \"performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts\" all while Rep. Cuellar was promising to use his office for the benefit of Azerbaijan's foreign policy as well as influencing \"high-ranking\" officials in the executive branch to benefit the Mexico City bank, according to the indictment.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Cuellar influenced a series of legislative measures regarding Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia, inserted language favored by Azerbaijan into legislation and committee reports governing certain security and economic aid programs and consulted with representatives of Azerbaijan regarding their efforts to lobby to the U.S. government.\n\nCuellar once served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, and repeatedly met with Azerbaijan officials, including the ambassador of Azerbaijan, Elin Suleymanov in that role.\n\nAs for the Mexico City bank, Cuellar is alleged to have accepted bribes in exchange for influencing federal regulation of the financial industry to benefit the bank and its affiliates, according to the indictment.\n\nAlso, the indictment said Cuellar allegedly \"advised and pressured\" executive branch officials regarding anti-money laundering enforcement practices that threatened the bank's business interests, supported legislation that would have blocked federal regulation of the payday lending industry and supported revisions to money-laundering statutes favored by the Mexican corporate conglomerate to which the bank was a member.\n\nThe Justice Department said Cuellar and his wife made their initial appearance Friday before a magistrate judge in Houston.\n\nCuellar his wife are each charged with the following offenses and if convicted, face maximum penalties as indicated: two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official and to have a public official act as an agent of a foreign principal (five years in prison on each count); two counts of bribery of a federal official (15 years in prison on each count); two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud (20 years in prison on each count); two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal (two years in prison on each count); one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering (20 years in prison); and five counts of money laundering (20 years in prison on each count).\n\nEarlier Friday, Cuellar claimed innocence.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar said in a statement. \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nRep. Cuellar will take a leave as ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while \"this matter is ongoing,\" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' spokesperson Christie Stephenson.\n\nRep.

Henry Cuellar of Texas vows to continue his bid for an 11th term despite bribery indictment", "body": "WASHINGTON -- For two decades, U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar has stood out as a moderate Democrat along the Texas-Mexico border, bucking his party at times over guns and immigration while seldom facing a tough reelection.\n\nBut a federal indictment accusing Cuellar of federal conspiracy and bribery charges is putting the Laredo native who was first elected in 2004 in a different spotlight. Cuellar, 68, and his wife, Imelda, 67, were taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe congressman professed his innocence after the indictment was revealed and vowed to continue his bid for an 11th term in November, saying, \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, denies any wrongdoing amid reports of pending indictments related to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press file\n\nThe Cuellars are accused of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar allegedly agreed to advance those entities' interests in the U.S.\n\nThe couple surrendered to authorities, made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nCuellar's family is a political fixture along the border: His brother is the sheriff in Laredo, and his sister, a former municipal judge, is also on the ballot this year, running as a Democratic candidate for state representative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral of Cuellar's allies in the district, which stretches from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio suburbs, expressed surprise over the indictments but said they would still support his reelection. Cuellar's moderate politics have helped him maintain support in places where Democrats have lost ground, like Starr County, a rural and agricultural part of South Texas.\n\n\"It is extremely surprising for me because I've known Henry for many, many years,\" Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said. \"He's always been a very straight guy, you know, very sincere. I mean, he's done so much for us in Starr County. I hate to see this going on.\"\n\nPresident Biden won Starr County by a slim, single-digit margin. Two years later, Cuellar won it by 40%.\n\nSylvia Bruni, chair of nearby Webb County's Democratic Party, said she would trust the legal system to work fairly and her focus would remain on elections. \"We have a campaign to advance, our Democracy at stake,\" she said in a statement.\n\nCuellar released a statement Friday saying he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they could be punished with up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple's children, according to the indictment. That company received payments from the Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a \"sham contract,\" purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and advising services.\n\n\"In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of Azerbaijan,\" the indictment says.\n\nImelda Cuellar is alleged to have sent a falsified invoice to the energy company's Washington, D.C., office under the agreement, saying her work was complete.\n\n\"In fact, Imelda Cuellar had performed little or no legitimate work under the contract,\" the indictment says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe indictment alleges that an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry Cuellar in text messages as both \"el Jefe\" and \"boss,\" and also that a member of Cuellar's staff sent multiple emails to officials at the State Department pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat's daughter.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022. Cuellar has been among his party's loudest critics of Biden, particularly over the administration's response to a record number of migrant crossings on the border. His moderate politics have aligned him at times with Republicans on issues including abortion and guns.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Henry Cuellar says he is 'innocent' ahead of potential indictmentLUKE BARR and BENJAMIN SIEGELMay 3, 2024 at 6:18 PM\n\nTexas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar is claiming innocence ahead of a potential indictment against him, according to a statement released from his office.\n\nIt is unclear what the charges are or when they could come down, but a source familiar with the situation told ABC News that he could be charged by federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar said in a statement on Friday. \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nMORE: FBI raid on House Democrat's home related to Azerbaijan probe, source says\n\nHe added that the actions he took in Congress were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\nThe FBI raided Cuellar's home and campaign office in Texas in January 2022 as part of a wide-ranging federal probe relating to the former Soviet state of Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen, a source familiar with the matter told ABC News. It's not yet clear if the indictment is related to the 2022 raid.\n\nCuellar said he proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee. He said both he and his wife requested a meeting with Washington, D.C. prosecutors \"to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side.\"\n\n\"These allegations have been difficult on my family. But, with your prayers, we will overcome. As the son of migrant workers, I was taught to wake up early and work hard. That's exactly what I've always done for the people of South Texas. I've devoted my life's work to creating jobs here, improving education, and securing our border,\" Cuellar said.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Cuellar hit with bribery charges tied to Azerbaijan, Mexican bank | Politics", "body": "The indictment, returned by a grand jury on Tuesday and unsealed on Friday, said the bribes were laundered through sham consulting contracts into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, the congressman's wife, from December 2014 through at least November 2021.

The indictment, returned by a grand jury on Tuesday and unsealed on Friday, said the bribes were laundered through sham consulting contracts into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, the congressman's wife, from December 2014 through at least November 2021.\n\nIn exchange, it says Henry Cuellar sought to use his public position to influence U.S. foreign policy in Azerbaijan's favor and to pressure U.S. government officials to help the Mexican bank lobby against anti-money laundering enforcement policies and payday lending regulations that threatened its business. Before the charges were unsealed, Cuellar issued a statement denying the allegations.\n\n\"Both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" said Cuellar. One of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, Cuellar is seeking an 11th two-year term in the Nov. 5 election. He represents a Texas district that borders Mexico and includes Laredo and parts of San Antonio.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Cuellar would be stepping down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee while the case is pending. Cuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo were searched by federal law enforcement in January 2022, when Cuellar served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn that capacity, he and several other members of Congress signed a letter urging Congress to provide humanitarian support to assist people displaced following the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The indictment cited Cuellar's support for providing funding to Azerbaijan and a pro-Azerbaijan speech he gave on the House floor, among other actions.\n\nCuellar said in his statement he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm. \"We requested a meeting with the Washington DC prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side,\" he added.\n\nThe Justice Department said Cuellar and his wife made initial appearances before a federal magistrate judge in Houston on Friday. They were released on bond. Each faces 14 counts on charges including conspiracy, bribery, honest services wire fraud, being a public official acting as an agent of a foreign principal, and money laundering.\n\nSeveral of the charges carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison. Cuellar is not the only member of Congress facing federal charges.\n\nDemocratic Senator Bob Menendez is awaiting trial on corruption charges\n\nin New York, while Republican George Santos last year was expelled from the House\n\nwhile he awaits trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws. Both Menendez and Santos deny wrongdoing.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

Henry Cuellar of Texas denied any wrongdoing amid reports of pending indictments related to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe longtime congressman released a statement Friday saying he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\n\n\"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nNeither Cuellar nor his attorney immediately responded to calls seeking comment on the matter. Officials with the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately confirm the indictments.\n\nNBC News, CNN and Fox News, all citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported Friday the Justice Department was expected to announce Cuellar's indictment.\n\nCuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation. That search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington, D.C., and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nFederal disclosures show that the nine-term congressman traveled to Azerbaijan in 2013.

The charges are strikingly similar to the indictment brought against Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, who was charged with accepting bribes on behalf of Egyptian businesses.\n\nIn a statement before the indictment, Mr. Cuellar maintained his innocence and said he cleared his wife's work with the Ethics Committee.

meeting.\n\nThe F.B.I. searched Mr. Cuellar's Laredo home in 2022, but he won a close primary victory anyway over a more progressive challenger, Jessica Cisneros.\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, said Mr. Cuellar would take leave from his post as the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while he fights the charges.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued member of the House Democratic Caucus,\" said Christie Stephenson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Jeffries. \"Like any American, Congressman

Cuellar hit with bribery charges tied to Azerbaijan, Mexican bank", "body": "By Sarah N. Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar and his wife were indicted for allegedly accepting close to $600,000 in bribes in two schemes meant to benefit an Azerbaijani state-owned energy company and an unnamed bank based in Mexico, court papers showed.\n\nThe indictment, returned by a grand jury on Tuesday and unsealed on Friday, said the bribes were laundered through sham consulting contracts into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, the congressman's wife, from December 2014 through at least November 2021.\n\nIn exchange, it says Henry Cuellar sought to use his public position to influence U.S. foreign policy in Azerbaijan's favor and to pressure U.S. government officials to help the Mexican bank lobby against anti-money laundering enforcement policies and payday lending regulations that threatened its business.\n\nBefore the charges were unsealed, Cuellar issued a statement denying the allegations.\n\n\"Both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" said Cuellar.\n\nOne of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, Cuellar is seeking an 11th two-year term in the Nov. 5 election. He represents a Texas district that borders Mexico and includes Laredo and parts of San Antonio.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Cuellar would be stepping down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee while the case is pending.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo were searched by federal law enforcement in January 2022, when Cuellar served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn that capacity, he and several other members of Congress signed a letter urging Congress to provide humanitarian support to assist people displaced following the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe indictment cited Cuellar's support for providing funding to Azerbaijan and a pro-Azerbaijan speech he gave on the House floor, among other actions.\n\nCuellar said in his statement he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm.\n\n\"We requested a meeting with the Washington DC prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side,\" he added.\n\nThe Justice Department said Cuellar and his wife made initial appearances before a federal magistrate judge in Houston on Friday. They were released on bond.\n\nEach faces 14 counts on charges including conspiracy, bribery, honest services wire fraud, being a public official acting as an agent of a foreign principal, and money laundering.\n\nSeveral of the charges carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison.\n\nCuellar is not the only member of Congress facing federal charges.\n\nDemocratic Senator Bob Menendez is awaiting trial on corruption charges in New York, while Republican George Santos last year was expelled from the House while he awaits trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws.\n\nBoth Menendez and Santos deny wrongdoing.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

He added that he had requested a meeting with federal prosecutors in Washington to discuss the investigation, but \"they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side.\"\n\nDuring the time that the FBI searched his home and campaign office in 2022, Cuellar served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus. In that capacity, he and several other members of Congress signed a letter urging Congress to provide \"humanitarian\" support in its fiscal 2022 spending bill to assist people displaced following the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\n\"The Russian presence is among the gravest challenges.

His district includes Laredo and other communities located along the border with Mexico, spanning as far south as Reynosa along the Rio Grande River, stretching northwest to Laredo and northeast to

Henry Cuellar's deep South Texas ties will again be tested", "body": "Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune's daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMcALLEN -- When federal agents raided the home and offices of U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, just weeks before a competitive primary election in 2022, Democrats rallied behind him and he went on to secure another term in office. Now facing charges of bribery and money laundering, he might need them to do the same.\n\nFriday's indictment threw a wrench in Cuellar and his party's South Texas plans for 2024, a year in which he had been expected to cruise to reelection. He immediately declared he's still running for reelection. But now there are calls from Republicans for him to resign and expressions of frustration from progressives who felt Democratic Party leaders shouldn't have stuck with him when the first hints of legal trouble emerged two years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, allies in his South Texas district, including some top local leaders, remain stalwart in their support of Cuellar. Some are referring to a familiar refrain: \"Innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\n\"Anyone can charge you with anything, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a fact,\" said Starr County Judge Eloy Vera, who added that he didn't think the allegations would hurt Cuellar's chances at reelection in November.\n\nVera's response highlights Cuellar's deep roots in the district. In Laredo, his hometown, Cuellar's brother and sister have both held local elected office.\n\nWhen federal investigators searched his home in 2022, it was only a few weeks before a hard-fought primary against progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros, a Laredo-based immigration attorney who lambasted Cuellar as \"Donald Trump's favorite Democrat.\" Cisneros targeted Cuellar, known as one of the most moderate Democrats in Congress, for his opposition to abortion rights and fundraising he did for colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\nBut then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rallied to his side, and Cuellar ended up winning in the primary runoff by 0.6 percentage points. Months later, he won the general election by a surprisingly large 13-percentage-point margin.\n\nOn Friday, many of Cuellar's progressive critics decried that establishment support, saying it put a Democratic seat -- and the party's hopes of a House majority -- at risk two years later. And they argued it would make it harder to use Donald Trump's criminal indictments against him if the party is maintaining its support of Cuellar.\n\nCuellar is accused of accepting almost $600,000 in bribes from the country of Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank in exchange for political favors in Congress.\n\n[Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar indicted on charges of bribery, money laundering]\n\nHe maintained his innocence Friday, and Democratic leadership appeared to stick with him -- at least for now. Because of party rules, Cuellar was temporarily stripped of his leadership role on the powerful Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee in the House. But Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stressed in a statement on Friday that Cuellar \"has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus.\"\n\n\"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Jeffries said.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, immediately called for Cuellar to resign.\n\n\"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" NRCC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said in a statement.\n\nTwo Republican challengers will face off in a May 28 runoff for the chance to challenge Cuellar in the general election: Jay Furman and Lazaro Garza.\n\nFurman issued a video statement shortly after the news of a potential indictment, blasting Cuellar as being part of an establishment that is \"selling us to other nations.\"\n\n\"They're trading us for their deep pockets and their forever policies that are against the values of South Texas,\" Furman said. \"Exciting that maybe one of them will get their due.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Garza said: \"There is no place for corruption in Congress!\"\n\nBut unseating Cuellar remains a big challenge. In nearly 20 years representing District 28 -- a district that stretches from the Texas-Mexico border from Webb County to Starr County, and then runs north to southeast San Antonio -- Cuellar has sowed deep ties. More often than most of the congressmen and women who serve the region, Cuellar has held press conferences with local officials to celebrate funding he helped secure for local projects.\n\nVera, the county judge, said Cuellar is conscientious about their needs and is available to them any time they call.\n\n\"He's delivered. I've got nothing but praise for that man,\" Vera said.\n\nWebb County Democratic Party Chair Sylvia Bruni says there is no denying Cuellar has been influential and brought millions of dollars into the district.\n\n\"I think the record is going to show that he's historically been very, very valuable,\" Bruni said. \"He's managed to work on both sides of the aisle which is something he takes great pride in.\"\n\nBruni said the party would continue advocating for every Democrat on the ballot, including Cuellar, though she acknowledged the indictment complicated their efforts.\n\n\"What is surfacing regarding Congressman Cuellar is certainly distressing, casting a dark cloud over all our sincerest efforts on behalf of our community,\" she said in a statement to Webb County Democrats. Still, she wrote, \"our WCDP will remain quiet regarding the allegations, presuming innocence, and trusting the Justice System to work fairly.\"\n\nIn an interview, Bruni added that Webb County remained a Democratic stronghold and she would count on voters to vote Democrat during a time she described as \"being on the brink of losing our democracy.\"\n\nHeading into November, Cuellar appeared to be on secure footing before Friday, with Republicans focusing their efforts in South Texas on two other congressional seats: Flipping District 15, currently held by first-term U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, and holding onto District 34 held by U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen.\n\nHowever, Jack Byhan, a political scientist at Texas A&M International University in Laredo, is not convinced Cuellar will weather the political storm.\n\n\"With something like this, it's the swing voters that are going to play a major role,\" he said. \"His loyal supporters are going to vote for him anyway and his loyal critics are going to vote against him anyway.\"\n\nHis ability and willingness to reach across the aisle to work with Republicans could help explain why he's been in office for so long, said Byhan.\n\n\"He's a good politician in terms of reading his constituency,\" Byhan said, noting the constituency in South Texas is predominantly Hispanic and tends to hold socially conservative views.\n\nThough she ultimately failed in her bids, Byhan said his opponent Cisneros' surprising performance in 2022 indicated Cuellar isn't as beloved as his supporters would like to believe.\n\n\"We were surprised at how well she did given her inexperience so I think that is a sign that he's acquiring a few more loyal critics,\" Byhan said.\n\nReporting in the Rio Grande Valley is supported in part by the Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, Inc.\n\nDisclosure: Facebook and Texas A&M International University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Henry Cuellar's deep South Texas ties will again be tested", "body": "McALLEN -- When federal agents raided the home and offices of U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, just weeks before a competitive primary election in 2022, Democrats rallied behind him and he went on to secure another term in office. Now facing charges of bribery and money laundering, he might need them to do the same.\n\nFriday's indictment threw a wrench in Cuellar and his party's South Texas plans for 2024, a year in which he had been expected to cruise to reelection. He immediately declared he's still running for reelection. But now there are calls from Republicans for him to resign and expressions of frustration from progressives who felt Democratic Party leaders shouldn't have stuck with him when the first hints of legal trouble emerged two years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, allies in his South Texas district, including some top local leaders, remain stalwart in their support of Cuellar. Some are referring to a familiar refrain: \"Innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\n\"Anyone can charge you with anything, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a fact,\" said Starr County Judge Eloy Vera, who added that he didn't think the allegations would hurt Cuellar's chances at reelection in November.\n\nVera's response highlights Cuellar's deep roots in the district. In Laredo, his hometown, Cuellar's brother and sister have both held local elected office.\n\nWhen federal investigators searched his home in 2022, it was only a few weeks before a hard-fought primary against progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros, a Laredo-based immigration attorney who lambasted Cuellar as \"Donald Trump's favorite Democrat.\" Cisneros targeted Cuellar, known as one of the most moderate Democrats in Congress, for his opposition to abortion rights and fundraising he did for colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\nBut then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rallied to his side, and Cuellar ended up winning in the primary runoff by 0.6 percentage points. Months later, he won the general election by a surprisingly large 13-percentage-point margin.\n\nOn Friday, many of Cuellar's progressive critics decried that establishment support, saying it put a Democratic seat -- and the party's hopes of a House majority -- at risk two years later. And they argued it would make it harder to use Donald Trump's criminal indictments against him if the party is maintaining its support of Cuellar.\n\nCuellar is accused of accepting almost $600,000 in bribes from the country of Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank in exchange for political favors in Congress.\n\n[Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar indicted on charges of bribery, money laundering]\n\nHe maintained his innocence Friday, and Democratic leadership appeared to stick with him -- at least for now. Because of party rules, Cuellar was temporarily stripped of his leadership role on the powerful Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee in the House. But Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stressed in a statement on Friday that Cuellar \"has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus.\"\n\n\"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Jeffries said.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, immediately called for Cuellar to resign.\n\n\"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" NRCC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said in a statement.\n\nTwo Republican challengers will face off in a May 28 runoff for the chance to challenge Cuellar in the general election: Jay Furman and Lazaro Garza.\n\nFurman issued a video statement shortly after the news of a potential indictment, blasting Cuellar as being part of an establishment that is \"selling us to other nations.\"\n\n\"They're trading us for their deep pockets and their forever policies that are against the values of South Texas,\" Furman said. \"Exciting that maybe one of them will get their due.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Garza said: \"There is no place for corruption in Congress!\"\n\nBut unseating Cuellar remains a big challenge. In nearly 20 years representing District 28 -- a district that stretches from the Texas-Mexico border from Webb County to Starr County, and then runs north to southeast San Antonio -- Cuellar has sowed deep ties. More often than most of the congressmen and women who serve the region, Cuellar has held press conferences with local officials to celebrate funding he helped secure for local projects.\n\nVera, the county judge, said Cuellar is conscientious about their needs and is available to them any time they call.\n\n\"He's delivered. I've got nothing but praise for that man,\" Vera said.\n\nWebb County Democratic Party Chair Sylvia Bruni says there is no denying Cuellar has been influential and brought millions of dollars into the district.\n\n\"I think the record is going to show that he's historically been very, very valuable,\" Bruni said. \"He's managed to work on both sides of the aisle which is something he takes great pride in.\"\n\nBruni said the party would continue advocating for every Democrat on the ballot, including Cuellar, though she acknowledged the indictment complicated their efforts.\n\n\"What is surfacing regarding Congressman Cuellar is certainly distressing, casting a dark cloud over all our sincerest efforts on behalf of our community,\" she said in a statement to Webb County Democrats. Still, she wrote, \"our WCDP will remain quiet regarding the allegations, presuming innocence, and trusting the Justice System to work fairly.\"\n\nIn an interview, Bruni added that Webb County remained a Democratic stronghold and she would count on voters to vote Democrat during a time she described as \"being on the brink of losing our democracy.\"\n\nHeading into November, Cuellar appeared to be on secure footing before Friday, with Republicans focusing their efforts in South Texas on two other congressional seats: Flipping District 15, currently held by first-term U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, and holding onto District 34 held by U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen.\n\nHowever, Jack Byhan, a political scientist at Texas A&M International University in Laredo, is not convinced Cuellar will weather the political storm.\n\n\"With something like this, it's the swing voters that are going to play a major role,\" he said. \"His loyal supporters are going to vote for him anyway and his loyal critics are going to vote against him anyway.\"\n\nHis ability and willingness to reach across the aisle to work with Republicans could help explain why he's been in office for so long, said Byhan.\n\n\"He's a good politician in terms of reading his constituency,\" Byhan said, noting the constituency in South Texas is predominantly Hispanic and tends to hold socially conservative views.\n\nThough she ultimately failed in her bids, Byhan said his opponent Cisneros' surprising performance in 2022 indicated Cuellar isn't as beloved as his supporters would like to believe.\n\n\"We were surprised at how well she did given her inexperience so I think that is a sign that he's acquiring a few more loyal critics,\" Byhan said.\n\nReporting in the Rio Grande Valley is supported in part by the Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, Inc.\n\nDisclosure: Facebook and Texas A&M International University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Henry Cuellar (D-TX) is expected to be indicted today. He has been on the Biden administration's radar for several years, and not in a good way.\n\nCuellar is the only pro-life Democrat in the House. He is openly critical of Biden's border crisis. He has represented Texas's 28th congressional district since 2005. His district extends from the Rio Grande to San Antonio's suburbs.\n\nCuellar is a rare centrist in today's Democrat Party. Progressive Democrats ran candidates against him in 2020 and 2022. This is a story that is breaking on a Friday. It feels like it is meant to bloody up Cuellar in an election cycle.\n\nAbortion is a key issue in President Biden's re-election campaign. Nothing is too extreme for Democrats when it comes to abortion. Cuellar did not make any fans among Team Biden when he declared that abortion is best left up to states, not the federal government.\n\nIn April, he boldly stated his position to Punchbowl.\n\n\"It should be left up to the states,\" Cuellar told us. \"I'm a big believer in the big tent theory and I think [Democrats] should allow people with different religious beliefs when it comes to that.\"\n\nNope. That's not gonna fly in today's Democrat Party.\n\nCuellar does not have any real opposition to his re-election this cycle. Two Republicans are running in a run-off election. Biden carried his district by 7 points in 2020. House Democrats have pledged their support of Cuellar's re-election.\n\nCuellar said he is not dropping out of the race.\n\nAll this goes back to an FBI raid that was conducted at Cuellar's home in Laredo and his local congressional office in January 2022. It happened just a matter of weeks before his primary election. At the time he was in a closely contested race with a progressive candidate, Jessica Cisneros, picked by Justice Democrats to run against him in the primary. She also ran against Cuellar in 2020. The 2020 race was much closer than the 2022 race. He won 56% of the vote in 2022. Justice Democrats are a far-left political action committee. They support the likes of Bernie Sanders, AOC, The Squad, and so on. You get the picture. Cisneros was a former intern with Cuellar's office and is currently an immigration lawyer.\n\nAt the time, I said that the raid and the publicity sure looked like Cuellar's opposition targeting him right before the election with the help of Biden's DOJ. The FBI and the DOJ refused to say what it was that they were investigating. ABC News reported that it had to do with a federal probe into the former Soviet state of Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen. A federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. was investigating the matter. Cuellar is a member of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nCuellar responded to the news of an indictment coming his way.\n\nIn his Friday statement, Cuellar said his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar said without addressing what the allegations were about. \"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nThat's the first I've heard of his wife's involvement. Is she a potential target? Cuellar has been told since the FBI raid that he is not a target in the investigation.\n\nSomething is off here. The timing is suspicious in an election year. Cuellar is sideways with the administration and other Democrats on abortion and the open southern border. Biden has completely politicized the DOJ against those who oppose him and his policies. I don't put anything past this administration.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karen_townsend@hotair.com", "name": "Karen Townsend",

Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) is claiming his innocence in a statement prior to reported incoming indictments, which were first reported by NBC News on Friday, May 3.\n\nMr. Cuellar, who has represented Texas's 28th Congressional District since 2005, said in the statement that he and his wife were both innocent and all of his actions in Congress have \"been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\n\"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" Mr. Cuellar said in the statement obtained by The Epoch Times. \"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\nMr. Cuellar's Laredo, Texas, home was raided in 2022 weeks before a primary election, and the congressman claimed his innocence at that time as well.\n\n\"There is an ongoing investigation that will show that there was no wrongdoing on my part,\" Mr. Cuellar said at the time. \"As an attorney, I know firsthand that the legal system is the pillar of our democracy. I pride myself on being your congressman and always doing things honestly, ethically and the right way.\"\n\nMr. Cuellar is seen as a moderate Democrat who has previously criticized President Joe Biden's handling of immigration and border policy. His district includes land that touches the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIt is still unclear what allegations Mr. Cuellar is referring to. ABC News reported at the time of the raid that the investigation of the couple and one of Mr. Cuellar's campaign staffers was related to alleged ties to Azerbaijan. The congressman is a member of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn the statement released following the news of his pending indictment, Mr. Cuellar said he had met with prosecutors in Washington to explain \"the facts\" but that they had \"refused to discuss the case\" with him and his wife or \"hear [their] side.\"\n\n\"Imelda and I have been married for 32 years,\" he said. \"On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working with banking, tax, and consulting. The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive.\"\n\nHe added the allegations, which are still unclear, have been difficult on his family, but with prayer he seeks to overcome them.\n\n\"As the son of migrant workers, I was taught to wake up early and work hard,\" he added. \"That's exactly what I've always done for the people of South Texas. I've devoted my life's work to creating jobs here, improving education, and securing our border.\"\n\nHe said he would not shy away from running for re-election this November and added that he was going \"to win.\"\n\nFBI agents were seen at Mr. Cuellar's home and campaign office on Jan. 19, 2022.

He represents a Texas district that borders Mexico and includes Laredo and parts of San Antonio.\n\nThe 54-page indictment identifies the bank only as \"Foreign Bank-1,\" a Mexico City-based institution that conducts payday lending in the U.S. and is part of a Mexican finance and retail holding company that also owns a Mexican media company.\n\nThat appears to match Grupo Salinas, a sprawling conglomerate controlled by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas, whose business empire includes Banco Azteca. The indictment also provides identifying details of a bank executive who appears to match a recently retired Banco Azteca executive.\n\n\"Right now, we don't have information about this,\" Grupo Salinas executive Luciano Pascoe told Reuters by email in response to a request for comment.\n\nCuellar will step down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee while the case is pending, said a spokesperson for Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo were searched by federal law enforcement in January 2022, when Cuellar served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn that capacity, he and several other members of Congress signed a letter urging Congress to provide humanitarian support to assist people displaced following the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe indictment cites Cuellar's support for providing funding to Azerbaijan and a pro-Azerbaijan speech he gave on the House floor, among other actions.\n\nCuellar said in his statement he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm.\n\n\"We requested a meeting with the Washington DC prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side,\" he added.\n\nThe Justice Department said Cuellar and his wife made initial appearances before a federal magistrate judge in Houston on Friday. They were released on bond.\n\nEach faces 14 counts on charges including conspiracy, bribery, honest services wire fraud, being a public official acting as an agent of a foreign principal, and money laundering.\n\nSeveral of the charges carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison.\n\nCuellar is not the only member of Congress facing federal charges.\n\nDemocratic Senator Bob Menendez is awaiting trial on corruption charges in New York, while Republican George Santos last year was expelled from the House while he awaits trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws.", "source":

Henry Cuellar and Wife Indicted on Bribery Charges | Common Dreams", "body": "\"In exchange for the bribe payments to Imelda Cuellar, Henry Cuellar agreed to perform official acts in his capacity as a member of Congress,\" the indictment states.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Friday that Democratic Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, were indicted last week for allegedly \"participating in two schemes involving bribery, unlawful foreign influence, and money laundering.\"\n\nAccording to the indictment, between at least December 2014 and November 2021, the Cuellars allegedly took approximately $600,000 in bribes from a fossil fuel company owned by the Azerbaijani government and an unnamed bank headquartered in Mexico City. The congressman, who has served on Capitol Hill for nearly two decades and is seeking reelection, previously co-chaired the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\n\"The bribe payments were laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar,\" the document states. \"In exchange for the bribe payments to Imelda Cuellar, Henry Cuellar agreed to perform official acts in his capacity as a member of Congress, to commit acts in violation of his official duties, and to act as an agent of the government of Azerbaijan and [the foreign bank].\"\n\nNBC News first reported early Friday that the Justice Department was expected to release the indictment, which came more than two years after a Federal Bureau of Investigation raid of the couple's Laredo home. Before the document was unsealed, the congressman claimed in a statement that his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar said Friday. \"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nThe Cuellars \"made their initial court appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Dena Palermo in Houston,\" the Justice Departmnet said Friday. If convicted of all the charges, the 68-year-old congressman and his 67-year-old wife could face decades in prison.\n\nCongressional Democratic leadership last year endorsed Cuellar for reelection in November, despite his opposition to abortion rights -- a key issue for this cycle at all levels of politics. During the 2022 cycle, after nearly losing to progressive primary challenger Jessica Cisneros, he beat the Republican nominee, Cassy Garcia, 57% to 43%.\n\nA spokesperson for U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), Christie Stephenson, saidin a Friday statement that \"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued member of the House Democratic Caucus. Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process.\"\n\n\"Pursuant to House Democratic Caucus Rule 24, Congressman Cuellar will take leave as ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while this matter is ongoing,\" Stephenson added.\n\nCuellar isn't the only Democrat in Congress battling allegations of corruption and bribery charges. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were indicted last September and accused of accepting bribes in the form of \"cash, gold, payments toward a home mortgage, compensation for a low-or-no-show job, a luxury vehicle, and other things of value.\"\n\nThe following month, the Justice Department accused the senator of acting as an unregistered agent for the government of Egypt. Menendez has denied wrongdoing and refused to resign. Although he is not seeking reelection as a Democrat, he has teased a possible independent run if he is exonerated.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common

Henry Cuellar, the Texas Democrat indicted by the Justice Department?", "body": "The Justice Department released an indictment against Texas Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar on criminal charges, multiple media outlets reported on Friday.\n\nHere is what we know.\n\nCuellar is serving his tenth term in the U.S. House of Representatives for Texas' 28th congressional district, which includes the cities of Laredo, Rio Grande City, and San Antonio.\n\nAccording to a biography, Cuellar was born in Laredo, Texas, where he earned his associate degree from Laredo Community College before enrolling at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He later earned several postgraduate degrees in Texas before he began practicing law in 1981. He also served as a Texas State Representative and Texas Secretary of State before becoming a U.S. Congressman.\n\nHe and his wife, Imelda, and two daughters live in Laredo.\n\nNBC News was the first to report about the expected indictment, stating that Cuellar and his wife are being charged with bribery and money laundering in connection to an Azerbaijani oil and gas company.\n\nNBC News reported that \"The Cuellars allegedly accepted roughly $600,000 in bribes from the two foreign entities in exchange for the congressman performing official acts.\"\n\nThe FBI executed a search warrant at Cuellar's home and campaign office in 2022 but it is unclear if any potential federal charges are related to the raid. Cuellar serves as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nHis lawyer Joshua Berman said in April that he was informed by the feds that Cuellar was not the focus of the investigation.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar said in a statement to USA TODAY, indicating his wife Imelda, is also involved.\n\n\"Proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" he said. \"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side.\"\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, swiftly responded to reports of an imminent criminal indictment and urged House Democrats to call on their colleague to resign.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar does not put Texas first, he puts himself first,\" Delanie Bomar, a spokesperson for the NRCC said in a statement. \"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on.\"\n\n-- USA TODAY reporter Ken Tran contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank.\"\n\nCuellar denied he or his wife did anything wrong in a statement issued before the charges were unsealed.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said in a statement through his campaign.\n\n\"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm. The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\nCuellar, who is a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, will have to step down from his post as the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' (D-N.Y) office noted in a statement nodding to House rules.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus. Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Jeffries spokeswoman Christie Stephenson said in the statement.\n\nCuellar also noted earlier Friday that he still plans to seek reelection.\n\nThe indictment makes Cuellar the second lawmaker in the last year to face bribery charges relating to a foreign government alongside his wife.

He represents a Texas district that borders Mexico and includes Laredo and parts of San Antonio.\n\nThe 54-page indictment identifies the bank only as \"Foreign Bank-1,\" a Mexico City-based institution that conducts payday lending in the US and is part of a Mexican finance and retail holding company that also owns a Mexican media company.\n\nThat appears to match Grupo Salinas, a sprawling conglomerate controlled by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas, whose business empire includes Banco Azteca. The indictment also provides identifying details of a bank executive who appears to match a recently retired Banco Azteca executive.\n\n\"Right now, we don't have information about this,\" Grupo Salinas executive Luciano Pascoe told Reuters by email in response to a request for comment.\n\nCuellar will step down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee while the case is pending, said a spokesperson for Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo were searched by federal law enforcement in January 2022, when Cuellar served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn that capacity, he and several other members of Congress signed a letter urging Congress to provide humanitarian support to assist people displaced following the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe indictment cites Cuellar's support for providing funding to Azerbaijan and a pro-Azerbaijan speech he gave on the House floor, among other actions.\n\nCuellar said in his statement he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm.\n\n\"We requested a meeting with the Washington, DC prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side,\" he added.\n\nThe Justice Department said Cuellar and his wife made initial appearances before a federal magistrate judge in Houston on Friday. They were released on bond.\n\nEach faces 14 counts on charges including conspiracy, bribery, honest services wire fraud, being a public official acting as an agent of a foreign principal, and money laundering.\n\nSeveral of the charges carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison.\n\nCuellar is not the only member of Congress facing federal charges.\n\nDemocratic Senator Bob Menendez is awaiting trial on corruption charges in New York, while Republican George Santos last year was expelled from the House while he awaits trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws.\n\nBoth

In exchange, it says Henry Cuellar sought to use his public position to influence U.S. foreign policy in Azerbaijan's favor and to pressure U.S. government officials to help the Mexican bank lobby against anti-money laundering enforcement policies and payday lending regulations that threatened its business.\n\nU.S. Representative Henry Cuellar and his wife were indicted for allegedly accepting close to $600,000 in bribes in two schemes meant to benefit an Azerbaijani state-owned energy company and an unnamed bank based in Mexico, court papers showed. The federal indictment, returned by a grand jury in Texas on Tuesday and unsealed on Friday, said the bribes were laundered through sham consulting contracts into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, the Democratic congressman's wife, from December 2014 through at least November 2021.\n\nIn exchange, it says Henry Cuellar sought to use his public position to influence U.S. foreign policy in Azerbaijan's favor and to pressure U.S. government officials to help the Mexican bank lobby against anti-money laundering enforcement policies and payday lending regulations that threatened its business. Before the charges were unsealed, Cuellar issued a statement denying the allegations.\n\n\"Both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" said Cuellar. One of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, Cuellar is seeking an 11th two-year term in the Nov. 5 election. He represents a Texas district that borders Mexico and includes Laredo and parts of San Antonio.\n\nThe 54-page indictment identifies the bank only as \"Foreign Bank-1,\" a Mexico City-based institution that conducts payday lending in the U.S. and is part of a Mexican finance and retail holding company that also owns a Mexican media company. That appears to match Grupo Salinas, a sprawling conglomerate controlled by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas, whose business empire includes Banco Azteca. The indictment also provides identifying details of a bank executive who appears to match a recently retired Banco Azteca executive.\n\n\"Right now, we don't have information about this,\" Grupo Salinas executive Luciano Pascoe told Reuters by email in response to a request for comment. Cuellar will step down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee while the case is pending, said a spokesperson for Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo were searched by federal law enforcement in January 2022, when Cuellar served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus. In that capacity, he and several other members of Congress signed a letter urging Congress to provide humanitarian support to assist people displaced following the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe indictment cites Cuellar's support for providing funding to Azerbaijan and a pro-Azerbaijan speech he gave on the House floor, among other actions. Cuellar said in his statement he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm.\n\n\"We requested a meeting with the Washington DC prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side,\" he added. The Justice Department said Cuellar and his wife made initial appearances before a federal magistrate judge in Houston on Friday. They were released on bond.\n\nEach faces 14 counts on charges including conspiracy, bribery, honest services wire fraud, being a public official acting as an agent of a foreign principal, and money laundering. Several of the charges carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison.\n\nCuellar is not the only member of Congress facing federal charges. Democratic Senator Bob Menendez is awaiting trial on corruption charges in New York, while Republican George Santos last year was expelled from the House while he awaits trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws.\n\nBoth Menendez and Santos deny wrongdoing.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Prosecutors said in exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, the congressman agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank.\n\nCuellar previously served as co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nCuellar and his wife were both charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official and to have a public official act as an agent of a foreign principal, two counts of bribery of a federal official, two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal, one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering and five counts of money laundering.\n\nThe money laundering charges carry up to 20 years in prison on each count.\n\nFriday's indictment follows a 2022 FBI raid on Cuellar's home and campaign office.\n\nThe FBI and the Department of State's Office of Inspector General investigated the case.\n\nCuellar has represented Texas's 28th Congressional District since 2005. His district includes Laredo and other communities located along the border with Mexico, spanning as far south as Reynosa along the Rio Grande River, stretching northwest to Laredo and northeast to San Antonio.\n\nAzerbaijan, a part of the South Caucasus region, spent about $480,000 on lobbying in Washington in 2023, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nMore from this section\n\nCal South Strengthens

Henry Cuellar (D,. Texas) and his wife Imelda have been charged with accepting and laundering more than half a million dollars in foreign bribes, according to an indictment released by the Department of Justice on Friday.\n\nCuellar and his wife allegedly pocketed \"at least $598,000 in bribes from two foreign entities\": an oil and gas company controlled by the Azerbaijani government and a bank headquartered in Mexico City.\n\nThe payments were then allegedly laundered \"through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little to no legitimate work under [sham consulting] contracts.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors claim that the Democratic congressman in return for the bribes agreed to use \"the power and prestige of his office to advance [the two companies'] interests in the United States.\" Cuellar allegedly promised to shift U.S. foreign policy in Azerbaijan's favor, while pledging to alter federal regulations of the financial sector to benefit the Mexican bank and its affiliates.\n\nCuellar on Friday denied any wrongdoing and appeared in a Houston court alongside his wife. \"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said in a statement.\n\n\"Imelda and I have been married for 32 years,\" the Texas Democrat added. \"On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working with banking, tax, and consulting. The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive.\"\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office were raided in January 2022 by federal agents during an investigation into Azerbaijan's influence in the United States, although it is not yet clear whether the indictment is related to the raid.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar does not put Texas first; he puts himself first,\" said Delanie Bomar, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not -- they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on.\"\n\nCuellar is not the first Democratic official to have faced indictment this year on bribery charges.

Now facing charges of bribery and money laundering, he might need them to do the same.\n\nFriday's indictment threw a wrench in Cuellar and his party's South Texas plans for 2024, a year in which he had been expected to cruise to reelection. He immediately declared he's still running for reelection. But now there are calls from Republicans for him to resign and expressions of frustration from progressives who felt Democratic Party leaders shouldn't have stuck with him when the first hints of legal trouble emerged two years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, allies in his South Texas district, including some top local leaders, remain stalwart in their support of Cuellar. Some are referring to a familiar refrain: \"Innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\n\"Anyone can charge you with anything, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a fact,\" said Starr County Judge Eloy Vera, who added that he didn't think the allegations would hurt Cuellar's chances at reelection in November.\n\nVera's response highlights Cuellar's deep roots in the district. In Laredo, his hometown, Cuellar's brother and sister have both held local elected office.\n\nWhen federal investigators searched his home in 2022, it was only a few weeks before a hard-fought primary against progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros, a Laredo-based immigration attorney who lambasted Cuellar as \"Donald Trump's favorite Democrat.\" Cisneros targeted Cuellar, known as one of the most moderate Democrats in Congress, for his opposition to abortion rights and fundraising he did for colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\nBut then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rallied to his side, and Cuellar ended up winning in the primary runoff by 0.6 percentage points. Months later, he won the general election by a surprisingly large 13-percentage-point margin.\n\nOn Friday, many of Cuellar's progressive critics decried that establishment support, saying it put a Democratic seat -- and the party's hopes of a House majority -- at risk two years later. And they argued it would make it harder to use Donald Trump's criminal indictments against him if the party is maintaining its support of Cuellar.\n\nCuellar is accused of accepting almost $600,000 in bribes from the country of Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank in exchange for political favors in Congress.\n\nHe maintained his innocence Friday, and Democratic leadership appeared to stick with him -- at least for now. Because of party rules, Cuellar was temporarily stripped of his leadership role on the powerful Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee in the House. But Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stressed in a statement on Friday that Cuellar \"has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus.\"\n\n\"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Jeffries said.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, immediately called for Cuellar to resign.\n\n\"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" NRCC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said in a statement.\n\nTwo Republican challengers will face off in a May 28 runoff for the chance to challenge Cuellar in the general election: Jay Furman and Lazaro Garza.\n\nFurman issued a video statement shortly after the news of a potential indictment, blasting Cuellar as being part of an establishment that is \"selling us to other nations.\"\n\n\"They're trading us for their deep pockets and their forever policies that are against the values of South Texas,\" Furman said. \"Exciting that maybe one of them will get their due.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Garza said: \"There is no place for corruption in Congress!\"\n\nBut unseating Cuellar remains a big challenge. In nearly 20 years representing District 28 -- a district that stretches from the Texas-Mexico border from Webb County to Starr County, and then runs north to southeast San Antonio -- Cuellar has sowed deep ties. More often than most of the congressmen and women who serve the region, Cuellar has held press conferences with local officials to celebrate funding he helped secure for local projects.\n\nVera, the county judge, said Cuellar is conscientious about their needs and is available to them any time they call.\n\n\"He's delivered. I've got nothing but praise for that man,\" Vera said.\n\nWebb County Democratic Party Chair Sylvia Bruni says there is no denying Cuellar has been influential and brought millions of dollars into the district.\n\n\"I think the record is going to show that he's historically been very, very valuable,\" Bruni said. \"He's managed to work on both sides of the aisle which is something he takes great pride in.\"\n\nBruni said the party would continue advocating for every Democrat on the ballot, including Cuellar, though she acknowledged the indictment complicated their efforts.\n\n\"What is surfacing regarding Congressman Cuellar is certainly distressing, casting a dark cloud over all our sincerest efforts on behalf of our community,\" she said in a statement to Webb County Democrats. Still, she wrote, \"our WCDP will remain quiet regarding the allegations, presuming innocence, and trusting the Justice System to work fairly.\"\n\nIn an interview, Bruni added that Webb County remained a Democratic stronghold and she would count on voters to vote Democrat during a time she described as \"being on the brink of losing our democracy.\"\n\nHeading into November, Cuellar appeared to be on secure footing before Friday, with Republicans focusing their efforts in South Texas on two other congressional seats: Flipping District 15, currently held by first-term U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, and holding onto District 34 held by U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen.\n\nHowever, Jack Byhan, a political scientist at Texas A&M International University in Laredo, is not convinced Cuellar will weather the political storm.\n\n\"With something like this, it's the swing voters that are going to play a major role,\" he said. \"His loyal supporters are going to vote for him anyway and his loyal critics are going to vote against him anyway.\"\n\nHis ability and willingness to reach across the aisle to work with Republicans could help explain why he's been in office for so long, said Byhan.\n\n\"He's a good politician in terms of reading his constituency,\" Byhan said, noting the constituency in South Texas is predominantly Hispanic and tends to hold socially conservative views.\n\nThough she ultimately failed in her bids, Byhan said his opponent Cisneros' surprising performance in 2022 indicated Cuellar isn't as beloved as his supporters would like to believe.\n\n\"We were surprised at how well she did given her inexperience so I think that is a sign that he's acquiring a few more loyal critics,\" Byhan said.\n\nReporting in the Rio Grande Valley is supported in part by the Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, Inc.\n\nDisclosure: Facebook and Texas A&M International University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Henry Cuellar (D-TX) places the vulnerable Democrat in an even tighter predicament as he seeks reelection this fall, potentially giving an advantage to his Republican challenger in November.\n\nThe Justice Department announced a 28-count indictment against the Texas congressman and his wife on Friday, accusing Cuellar of allegedly accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities: the government of Azerbaijan and a bank based in Mexico City.\n\nAllegations against Cuellar began circulating in 2022, when his home and campaign offices in Laredo, Texas, were raided in January that year as part of the DOJ's investigation into Azerbaijan and businessmen connected to the nation. In April of that year, Cuellar's lawyer told several news outlets that the congressman was informed he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nNow, Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, are each charged with 14 counts: two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery, two counts of bribery of a federal official, two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, two counts of violating a ban on public officials acting as foreign agents, one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering, and five counts of money laundering. The charges carry a maximum sentence of more than 200 years in prison for both the congressman and his wife, but sentencing in the Cuellars' case would likely not result in the maximum penalties.\n\nCuellar proclaimed his innocence ahead of the DOJ's indictment, arguing that he and his wife are innocent and that \"everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\n\"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" the Texas Democrat said. \"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\nCuellar noted that he is still running for reelection in November and \"will win.\"\n\nHow the indictment will affect Cuellar's chances of reelection remains to be seen. As of Friday, Cuellar's seat was ranked \"likely Democrat\" and D-plus-3 by the Cook Political Report. However, he has faced competitive races in years past, narrowly defeating a progressive primary challenger in 2022.\n\nA member of the House's centrist Blue Dogs and New Democrat Coalitions, Cuellar came to Congress in 2004. He is the sole House Democrat who opposes abortion rights, a flashpoint for several members of his own party.\n\nThis year, Republicans Lazaro Garza and Jay Furman are heading to a runoff election on May 28 after neither candidate was able to claim 50% of the vote. Furman exited with 44.86%, with Garza receiving 27.13%, per the Texas Secretary of State's office.\n\nShortly after news of the indictment broke, House Republicans' campaign arm released a statement asking whether Cuellar's fellow Democrats would call on him to resign.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar does not put Texas first, he puts himself first,\" NRCC spokeswoman Delanie Bomar said in a statement. \"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), who endorsed Cuellar's reelection bid last summer, said in a statement that Cuellar is a \"valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus,\" noting that the Texas congressman is \"entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process.\"\n\nCuellar will, however, step aside from his position as ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee's appropriations subcommittee, Jeffries noted.\n\nThe Texas Democrat's GOP challengers wasted no time using this indictment for campaigning purposes. Furman posted a video to X ahead of the indictment's release, calling the looming charges against Cuellar \"politics normal.\"\n\n\"This what we're dealing with, this is what we're trying to kick out,\" Furman said. \"It's time for these guys to go. Time for the establishment to be put on their heels and pushed out for the corruption and for the attack on we, the people.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar is about to be indicted for crimes that we don't yet know the extent of yet,\" Furman continued. \"We do know, 20 years on after being in office, we're not any better.\"\n\nTexas Agriculture Department Commissioner Sid Miller, who has endorsed Furman, said with \"corrupt\" Cuellar facing an indictment, \"the race for [Texas's 28th Congressional District] just became a strong pick-up opportunity for Republicans.\"\n\nCuellar is the most recent congressional member to face federal charges. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and his wife are facing bribery charges in connection to their \"corrupt\" relationship with three New Jersey businessmen. The DOJ alleged Menendez and his wife accepted gold bars worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from a felon in a trade for help.\n\nFormer New York Republican Rep. George Santos was charged with 13 felony counts in May 2023 over accusations that he misled donors and misrepresented finances and was hit with 10 additional counts in October. He has since pleaded not guilty, and a federal criminal trial is on hold to allow him to engage in \"continuing plea negotiations.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nIn January, he asked a federal judge for more time to pursue a plea deal, and in April, he withdrew his independent bid for New York's 1st Congressional District. One New York Republican told the Washington Examiner, \"That's short for: I'm taking a plea deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"},

Henry Cuellar indicted on conspiracy, bribery charges", "body": "By Mark Reagan, The Monitor, McAllen, Texas The Tribune Content Agency\n\nMay 3-U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, and his wife Imelda Cuellar have been indicted on conspiracy, bribery and money laundering charges.\n\nThe charges follow a U.S. Department of Justice probe into ties between business leaders in America and Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic, the agency announced in a press release.\n\nCuellar and his wife are accused of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from 2014 to 2021 from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank headquartered in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar would allegedly advance the country's interests.\n\n\"The bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts,\" the release stated.\n\nCuellar agreed to deliver a favorable Azerbaijan speech and to influence legislation that would be beneficial to the country, according to the release.\n\n\"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank,\" the release stated.\n\nThe Cuellars are each charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official; two counts of bribery of a federal official; two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud; two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal; one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering; and five counts of money laundering.\n\nThe charges carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe Cuellars made an initial court appearance Friday in Houston federal court in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Dena Palermo.\n\nIn a statement to the Texas Tribune, Cuellar said that his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\nCuellar mentions his wife in that statement, saying that they are both innocent and that he \"proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nCuellar is currently running for reelection. He will face either Republicans Jay Furman or Lazaro Garza, who are in a runoff.\n\nFurman said in a Facebook video that Cuellar - the establishment - should be pushed out, saying he is corrupt.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Garza said there is no place for corruption in Congress.\n\nThe Monitor first reported that \"court-authorized\" law enforcement activity occurred at Cuellar's Laredo home and at his downtown campaign office in January 2022.\n\nAt the time, the FBI only provided confirmation that special agents were present in the vicinity of Windridge Drive and Estate Drive in Laredo.\n\n\"The FBI cannot provide further comment on an ongoing investigation,\" the agency said at the time.\n\nA Monitor reporter at the scene in 2022 observed federal vehicles at the congressman's house where over two dozen agents were also seen taking items from the residence.\n\nTwo agents with a clipboard and camera took photos and a truck was photographed and searched by agents. Several government vehicles were also seen outside his campaign office.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Mr Cuellar's defenders have long said he is the only Democrat who can win in the heavily conservative and Latino Rio Grande Valley.\n\nHe was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn 2022, the FBI raided Mr Cuellar's congressional office in Laredo and his home. His attorney at that time said the congressman was not the target of that investigation.\n\nThat search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington DC, and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press.\n\nFederal disclosures show that the nine-term congressman traveled to Azerbaijan in 2013. Two years later, Mr Cuellar's office announced an agreement between a Texas university and an organization called the Assembly of Friends of Azerbaijan for the purposes of collaborating on oil and gas research and education.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the raids in 2022, Mr Cuellar went on to beat back a left-wing Democratic challenger - Jessica Cisneros - for the second time.\n\nA year after the raid on his home the congressman told the Texas Tribune: \"There has been no wrongdoing on my part... My focus remains the same from my very first day in office: delivering results for Texans across my district.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

He represents a Texas district that borders Mexico and includes Laredo and parts of San Antonio.\n\nThe 54-page indictment identifies the bank only as \"Foreign Bank-1,\" a Mexico City-based institution that conducts payday lending in the U.S. and is part of a Mexican finance and retail holding company that also owns a Mexican media company.\n\nThat appears to match Grupo Salinas, a sprawling conglomerate controlled by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas, whose business empire includes Banco Azteca. The indictment also provides identifying details of a bank executive who appears to match a recently retired Banco Azteca executive.\n\n\"Right now, we don't have information about this,\" Grupo Salinas executive Luciano Pascoe told Reuters by email in response to a request for comment.\n\nCuellar will step down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee while the case is pending, said a spokesperson for Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nCuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo were searched by federal law enforcement in January 2022, when Cuellar served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn that capacity, he and several other members of Congress signed a letter urging Congress to provide humanitarian support to assist people displaced following the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe indictment cites Cuellar's support for providing funding to Azerbaijan and a pro-Azerbaijan speech he gave on the House floor, among other actions.\n\nCuellar said in his statement he had sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee and a national law firm.\n\n\"We requested a meeting with the Washington DC prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side,\" he added.\n\nThe Justice Department said Cuellar and his wife made initial appearances before a federal magistrate judge in Houston on Friday. They were released on bond.\n\nEach faces 14 counts on charges including conspiracy, bribery, honest services wire fraud, being a public official acting as an agent of a foreign principal, and money laundering.\n\nSeveral of the charges carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison.\n\nCuellar is not the only member of Congress facing federal charges.\n\nDemocratic Senator Bob Menendez is awaiting trial on corruption charges in New York, while Republican George Santos last year was expelled from the House while he awaits trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws.\n\nBoth Menendez and Santos deny wrongdoing.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

He barely won his election in 2022, thanks to Nancy Pelosi and her allies. Today, his seat is at risk.\n\n\u00d7 Expand\n\nMark Schiefelbein/AP Photo\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) speaks during a hearing of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, April 10, 2024, on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nWhen Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) faced a primary challenge two years ago from progressive Jessica Cisneros, the Democratic leadership closed ranks. They held fundraisers for Cuellar, recorded robocalls for him, appeared at rallies in his district, and took every possible opportunity to nudge Cuellar, a Blue Dog who voted against Democratic priorities on several occasions, across the finish line. After a recount, he ended up winning by only 289 votes. It's plausible that the establishment money and support made the difference.\n\nThe leadership justified standing behind the only anti-abortion Democrat in Congress by saying that only he could win that district in South Texas, which Joe Biden took in 2020 by seven points. A progressive would be too risky in TX-28, at a time when the House majority would come down to just a few seats.\n\nThe thought of risk never came up in reference to Cuellar, even though, just a few months before that 2022 primary, the FBI raided his house as part of a corruption investigation involving business ties to Azerbaijan. At the time, The Intercept did a long report on Cuellar's ties to Azerbaijani oil executives.\n\nCuellar and his attorney insisted there were no legs to the investigation, and that he was innocent. And the House leadership backed him up, dismissing any possible legal jeopardy.\n\nMore from David Dayen\n\nCuellar has now been indicted on 14 counts by the Justice Department, along with his wife, for taking $600,000 in bribes, one from a state-owned oil and gas company in Azerbaijan. (The other bribe came from a Mexico-based bank.) In exchange, Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his powers as a member of Congress to influence foreign policy involving Azerbaijan, as well as pressure bank regulators for favorable policy toward the Mexican bank. The couple is also accused of laundering the bribe payments through shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. They face up to 204 years in prison if they get the maximum sentence on all counts.\n\nAfter appearing in federal court in Houston today, Cuellar maintained his innocence. \"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" he said, adding that his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\nThe court case will play out over years; the court of public opinion is another matter. Cuellar has already won the Democratic nomination for Texas's 28th Congressional District; this year he ran unopposed. Candidates can withdraw from elections in Texas in a timely manner, but with Cuellar pronouncing himself innocent, and with his seat in Congress a potential bargaining chip for any settlement, it's unclear whether he would withdraw.\n\nThat makes it somewhat likely that Democrats will be running an indicted public official in TX-28 this year, when they had every opportunity to toss him out of office two years prior, with the explicit knowledge of the possibility of a corruption scandal. The Democratic leadership lined up in his favor instead, and now this seat -- which as everyone has said is not a slam dunk -- is clearly in play for Republicans to flip.\n\nControl of Congress will likely be so razor-thin that any one seat could be the difference between Democratic and Republican control. So the wall of establishment support for Cuellar in 2022 could plausibly lose them Congress in 2024, precisely the disaster they claimed to be attempting to avoid by backing the now-indicted congressman.\n\nWaleed Shahid, a former spokesperson for Justice Democrats when they supported Cisneros over Cuellar, told the Prospect: \"The Democratic Party establishment chose to wholeheartedly side with a corrupt, anti-choice Democrat rather than let the progressives grow their ranks by just one member.\"\n\n\"Pelosi Has Endorsed Me\"\n\nHigh-level Democratic support for Cuellar in 2022 went beyond a pro forma endorsement. The Prospect reported from San Antonio when Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), then majority whip, appeared at a get-out-the-vote rally with Cuellar almost exactly two years ago. The blessing from House leadership was one of Cuellar's main selling points at the rally: \"Pelosi has endorsed me. Steny has endorsed me. Clyburn has endorsed me,\" he boasted.\n\nClyburn acknowledged at the rally that \"I don't agree with Henry Cuellar on everything,\" but that clearly didn't matter enough to withhold his support. Neither did a leaked Supreme Court draft in the Dobbs case, which eventually overturned Roe v. Wade. In 2021, the House of Representatives passed legislation that codified Roe, the Women's Health Protection Act, and Cuellar was the only Democrat to vote against it. At the time, Democratic leaders were all running on abortion as a signature electoral issue.\n\nBeyond abortion, Cuellar was a malign force in the Democratic caucus throughout Joe Biden's first two years. He voted against the PRO Act that would make it easier to join unions. He demanded the delinking of the infrastructure bill from the Build Back Better Act, which almost doomed both measures. He urged the maintaining of the Title 42 policy that barred immigrants from crossing the border, at the time at odds with the Biden administration.\n\nSteny, which refers to former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, actually endorsed Cuellar the same day as the FBI raid on his house. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi also endorsed, and according to Prospect reporting, Cuellar also received re-election support from three political firms approved by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democratic election arm. Pelosi and Clyburn did robocalls for Cuellar in the election, which went to a May runoff that he won by a tiny margin.\n\nToday, the new Democratic leadership, after Pelosi, Hoyer, and Clyburn stepped down, has to run statements like the one House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) made today through a spokesperson: \"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process. Pursuant to House Democratic Caucus Rule 24, Congressman Cuellar will take leave as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while this matter is ongoing.\"\n\nBut the electoral fallout cannot be contained. Neither party has such an advantage in the House that even one seat can be sacrificed in November. Democrats saddled with an indicted congressman in TX-28 can easily be the margin of victory.\n\nSome would say that incumbency dictated the Democratic leadership's decision to back Cuellar. But The Intercept reported today that pro-Israel interests expect to spend $20 million or more to dislodge both Reps. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) and Cori Bush (D-MO) from Congress, without much resistance from House leaders.\n\n\"The glaring discrepancy in the Democratic Party's responses -- rallying behind Henry Cuellar to fend off a primary challenge while showing minimal effort in shielding progressive incumbents from AIPAC today -- underscores their selective enforcement of unity,\" Shahid said.", "source":

Henry Cuellar (D-TX) places the vulnerable Democrat in an even tighter predicament as he seeks reelection this fall, potentially giving an advantage to his Republican challenger in November.\n\nThe Justice Department announced a 28-count indictment against the Texas congressman and his wife on Friday, accusing Cuellar of allegedly accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities: the government of Azerbaijan and a bank based in Mexico City.\n\nAllegations against Cuellar began circulating in 2022, when his home and campaign offices in Laredo, Texas, were raided in January that year as part of the DOJ's investigation into Azerbaijan and businessmen connected to the nation. In April of that year, Cuellar's lawyer told several news outlets that the congressman was informed he was not the target of the investigation.\n\nNow, Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, are each charged with 14 counts: two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery, two counts of bribery of a federal official, two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, two counts of violating a ban on public officials acting as foreign agents, one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering, and five counts of money laundering. The charges carry a maximum sentence of more than 200 years in prison for both the congressman and his wife, but sentencing in the Cuellars' case would likely not result in the maximum penalties.\n\nCuellar proclaimed his innocence ahead of the DOJ's indictment, arguing that he and his wife are innocent and that \"everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\n\"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" the Texas Democrat said. \"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\nCuellar noted that he is still running for reelection in November and \"will win.\"\n\nHow the indictment will affect Cuellar's chances of reelection remains to be seen. As of Friday, Cuellar's seat was ranked \"likely Democrat\" and D-plus-3 by the Cook Political Report. However, he has faced competitive races in years past, narrowly defeating a progressive primary challenger in 2022.\n\nA member of the House's centrist Blue Dogs and New Democrat Coalitions, Cuellar came to Congress in 2004. He is the sole House Democrat who opposes abortion rights, a flashpoint for several members of his own party.\n\nThis year, Republicans Lazaro Garza and Jay Furman are heading to a runoff election on May 28 after neither candidate was able to claim 50% of the vote. Furman exited with 44.86%, with Garza receiving 27.13%, per the Texas Secretary of State's office.\n\nShortly after news of the indictment broke, House Republicans' campaign arm released a statement asking whether Cuellar's fellow Democrats would call on him to resign.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar does not put Texas first, he puts himself first,\" NRCC spokeswoman Delanie Bomar said in a statement. \"If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), who endorsed Cuellar's reelection bid last summer, said in a statement that Cuellar is a \"valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus,\" noting that the Texas congressman is \"entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process.\"\n\nCuellar will, however, step aside from his position as ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee's appropriations subcommittee, Jeffries noted.\n\nThe Texas Democrat's GOP challengers wasted no time using this indictment for campaigning purposes. Furman posted a video to X ahead of the indictment's release, calling the looming charges against Cuellar \"politics normal.\"\n\n\"This what we're dealing with, this is what we're trying to kick out,\" Furman said. \"It's time for these guys to go. Time for the establishment to be put on their heels and pushed out for the corruption and for the attack on we, the people.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar is about to be indicted for crimes that we don't yet know the extent of yet,\" Furman continued. \"We do know, 20 years on after being in office, we're not any better.\"\n\nTexas Agriculture Department Commissioner Sid Miller, who has endorsed Furman, said with \"corrupt\" Cuellar facing an indictment, \"the race for [Texas's 28th Congressional District] just became a strong pick-up opportunity for Republicans.\"\n\nCuellar is the most recent congressional member to face federal charges. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and his wife are facing bribery charges in connection to their \"corrupt\" relationship with three New Jersey businessmen. The DOJ alleged Menendez and his wife accepted gold bars worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from a felon in a trade for help.\n\nFormer New York Republican Rep. George Santos was charged with 13 felony counts in May 2023 over accusations that he misled donors and misrepresented finances and was hit with 10 additional counts in October. He has since pleaded not guilty, and a federal criminal trial is on hold to allow him to engage in \"continuing plea negotiations.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nIn January, he asked a federal judge for more time to pursue a plea deal, and in April, he withdrew his independent bid for New York's 1st Congressional District. One New York Republican told the Washington Examiner, \"That's short for: I'm taking a plea deal.\"\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Furman and Garza for comment.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Cuellar to resign", "body": "The campaign arm of House Republicans urged Democrats Monday to call on indicted Rep. Henry Cuellar to resign, just like Democrats pushed the GOP to oust former Rep. George Santos over criminal charges.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar does not put Texas first, he puts himself first. If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign,\" said National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar. \"If not -- they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on.\"\n\nRepublicans say their planned attacks on Democrats over Mr. Cuellar are no different than when Democrats last year urged GOP lawmakers to push out former Mr. Santos, New York Republican, before any resolution of the federal charges against him.\n\nRep. Dean Phillips, Minnesota Democrat who recently withdrew from the presidential Democratic primary, is the only Democrat who has called on Mr. Cuellar to resign since the Texas Democrat's indictment was released by the Justice Department on Friday.\n\n\"While the bar for Federal indictment is high, trust in our government is low,\" Mr. Phillips said in a post on the social media platform X. \"That's why office holders and candidates under indictment should resign or end their campaigns, including Sen. Bob Menendez, Donald Trump, & Rep. Henry Cuellar.\"\n\nFederal authorities have indicted Mr. Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, and his wife in an alleged bribery scheme.\n\nRepublicans are pressuring Democrats to push out Mr. Cuellar, Texas Democrat, who was recently charged, along with his wife Imelda, of accepting foreign bribes close to $600,000.\n\nThe bribes allegedly came between 2014 and 2021 from an oil and gas firm owned by the Azerbaijani government and a bank based in Mexico City. According to federal prosecutors, the payoff went through a Texas-based shell company owned by Mrs. Cuellar.\n\nThe indictment said that in exchange for the cash, the Texas Democrat agreed to promote the interests of the Azerbaijani government and the bank in the U.S.\n\nMr. Cuellar, previously co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, said in a statement that he is \"innocent of these allegations.\"\n\nHe also defended his wife of 32 years, saying she is \"an accomplished business woman with two degrees [who] spent her career working with banking, tax, and consulting.\"\n\nThe Washington Times reached out to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for comment but did not immediately hear back.\n\nLast December, Mr. Cuellar was among 206 Democrats who voted with 105 Republicans to expel Mr. Santos, despite his own knowledge of federal officials investigating him after they raided his home in 2022.\n\nMr. Santos' short, chaotic tenure as a lawmaker was tarnished when details came to light that he lied about many aspects of his life, including his education, career background, religion and claiming his mother was killed when terrorists attacked the Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee later released a bruising 56-page report that described a litany of deceptive practices. Mr. Santos became the sixth lawmaker to be expelled from Congress and the first to be ejected before a conviction of any crime.\n\nChristie Stephenson, spokesperson for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, New York Democrat, said that Mr. Cuellar will take leave as the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee's homeland security subcommittee.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued member of the House Democratic Caucus,\" she said. \"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process.\"\n\nMr. Cuellar is pro-life and one of the most moderate House Democrats. He said he is \"running for reelection and will win this November.\"\n\nHis district, which extends from San Antonio to the border, was won by President Biden by seven percentage points in 2020. House Democratic leaders endorsed Mr. Cuellar last year. He narrowly won his primary in 2022 over a more liberal opponent.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If not - they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Congressional_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Republican Congressional Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/03/USAT/73557052007-usp-news-homeland-security-alejandro-mayorkas.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2999,1687,x0,y156&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537117", "eventUri": "eng-9537117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Mr Cuellar's defenders have long said he is the only Democrat who can win in the heavily conservative and Latino Rio Grande Valley.\n\nHe was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nIn 2022, the FBI raided Mr Cuellar's congressional office in Laredo and his home. His attorney at that time said the congressman was not the target of that investigation.\n\nThat search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington DC, and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press.\n\nFederal disclosures show that the nine-term congressman traveled to Azerbaijan in 2013. Two years later, Mr Cuellar's office announced an agreement between a Texas university and an organization called the Assembly of Friends of Azerbaijan for the purposes of collaborating on oil and gas research and education.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the raids in 2022, Mr Cuellar went on to beat back a left-wing Democratic challenger - Jessica Cisneros - for the second time.\n\nA year after the raid on his home the congressman told the Texas Tribune: \"There has been no wrongdoing on my part...

in two separate schemes intended to benefit the government of Azerbaijan and a bank headquartered in Mexico.\n\nThe indictment, returned by a grand jury on Tuesday and unsealed on Friday, alleges that from December 2014 through at least November 2021, Cuellar and his wife accepted close to $US600,000 ($A905,000) in bribes from Azerbaijan and the bank, which was not named.\n\nThe indictment said the bribes were laundered through sham consulting contracts and into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar.\n\nIn exchange, it says the congressman sought to use his public position to influence US foreign policy in Azerbaijan's favour and to pressure US government officials to help the bank lobby against anti-money laundering enforcement policies that threatened its business.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nAhead of the indictment on Friday, Cuellar issued a

the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, is seeking an 11th two-year term.\n\nHe represents a district that borders Mexico and includes Laredo and parts of San Antonio.\n\nGet

Democrat from the state of Texas, and his wife on claims the couple accepted $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-run oil company and a bank headquartered in Mexico.\n\n\"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Azerbaijani oil and gas company, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence US foreign policy in favour of Azerbaijan,\" the Department of Justice said in a statement.\n\nThe DOJ also claims that in exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Mr Cuellar agreed to \"influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking US Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank.\"\n\nThe charges come after Senator Bob Menendez, also a Democrat and former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was indicted in a corruption case involving Egypt and Qatar.\n\nCoincidentally, Mr Menendez had recently been at the forefront of Washington's efforts to halt assistance to Baku amid its siege on Nagorno-Karabakh late last year.\n\nThe UN Security Council discussed Azerbaijan's blockade on the territory in August, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor said the blockade may amount to a \"genocide\" against Armenians.\n\nMr Cuellar said in a Friday statement that he and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, \"are innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Mr Cuellar said.\n\n\"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the Cuellar home and campaign office in 2022.\n\nMr Cuellar has served in Congress for over two decades, and has been critical of the Democratic party's more left-leaning wing.\n\nA rare anti-abortion Democrat, he has also been more conservative on issues involving the southern border with Mexico, of which his district is close to.\n\nHe joined a group of moderate Democrats and Republicans this week in condemning Colombia's severing of ties with Israel, accusing President Gustavo Petro of anti-Semitism over the move.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellie_sennett@thenationalnews.com", "name":

Trump seems to think that things don't add up.\n\nOn Friday, the DOJ announced that it had indicted Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) who it alleged used his office to influence U.S. foreign policy on Azerbaijan in exchange for bribes from an oil and gas company controlled by the former Soviet country.\n\nCuellar, whose congressional district is on the border, has been one of the Democratic party's most vocal critics of President Joe Biden and his immigration policies, something that the presumptive GOP nominee suggested played a part in his being charged.\n\n\"Biden just Indicted Henry Cuellar because the Respected Democrat Congressman wouldn't play Crooked Joe's Open Border game. He was for Border Control, so they said, 'Let's use the FBI and DOJ to take him out!' This is the way they operate. They're a bunch of D.C. Thugs, and at some point they will be paying a very big price for what they have done to our Country. CROOKED JOE BIDEN IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY!\" Trump said in a Sunday night Truth Social post.\n\nAlso indicted by the feds was the Lone Star State congressman's wife, Imelda, who the DOJ alleged was a part of the $600,00 bribery scheme that involved a Mexican bank as well as Azerbaijan.\n\nAccording to a Justice Department press release: Congressman Cuellar and Imelda Cuellar allegedly accepted approximately $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities: an oil and gas company wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Azerbaijan, and a bank headquartered in Mexico City. The bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts.\"\n\n\"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Azerbaijani oil and gas company, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan. In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank,\" the DOJ said.\n\n\"I want to make it clear that my wife Imelda and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar told reporters. The couple appeared in a Houston, TX federal court on Friday and were each released on a $100,000 bond.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Cuellar are charged with conspiracy to commit bribery, bribery of a federal official, conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal, conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering and money laundering, according to the DOJ. If convicted, they could spend the rest of their lives behind bars.\n\nIn March, Cuellar was one of the Democrats who unveiled a new \"border security\" task force. He was also the victim of an armed carjacking near his Washington, D.C. office last year.\n\n\"These people are running a Gestapo administration,\" Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser over the weekend.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Henry Cuellar's re-election campaign", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A federal criminal investigation involving U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar comes just as the South Texas Democrat's reelection campaign is heating up, with early voting beginning in less than a month in his primary rematch with immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who narrowly lost to the longtime incumbent in 2020.\n\nThe FBI descended on Cuellar's home and campaign headquarters in Laredo on Wednesday afternoon, conducting what the agency described as \"court-authorized law enforcement activity.\" Agents spent more than four hours at his home and loaded large bags, plastic bins and a computer into a federal vehicle before leaving around 11 p.m., the McAllen Monitor reported.\n\nIt's unclear what the FBI is investigating. Cuellar issued a statement Wednesday night saying he will \"will fully cooperate.\"\n\n\"He is committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld,\" the statement said.\n\nBut the federal investigation comes at a trying time for Cuellar, a 17-year incumbent whose close call in the 2020 primary against the progressive Cisneros drew a flood of national money and attention.\n\nBACKGROUND: FBI searches Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar's home in Laredo\n\nTannya Benavides, a former teacher and political organizer based in Laredo, has joined this year's primary race, as well, inspired in part by the success Cisneros saw in 2020.\n\nThe district has also been targeted by congressional Republicans after the GOP made gains in South Texas in 2020. Seven Republicans are vying to challenge Cuellar, though the district was redrawn to be a bit bluer and he won by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2020 general election.\n\nThe FBI searches came just a week after Cuellar, one of the most senior members of the Texas delegation, announced his campaign had raised $700,000 in the final quarter of 2021, a personal record for him.\n\nCuellar's campaign on Wednesday touted an endorsement from House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and in recent days posted videos and photos of the congressman knocking on doors in San Antonio and Laredo.\n\nCuellar's campaign did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.\n\nCisneros issued a statement Thursday saying she was aware of news reports about the investigation.\n\n\"We are closely watching as this develops,\" she said. \"In the meantime, we are focused on our campaign to deliver change to South Texas families.\"\n\nDISTRICT REDRAWN: San Antonio to have more say in closely watched race between Rep. Cuellar, progressive challengers\n\nJustice Democrats, a national progressive group that first recruited Cisneros to run, was less restrained, saying Cuellar \"has been part of the corrupt culture in Washington for far too long.\"\n\n\"This FBI investigation into Congressman Cuellar is highly concerning,\" the statement said. \"The people of South Texas deserve answers, and the congressman should be transparent about the purpose of the investigation.\"\n\nRepublicans vying for Cuellar's seat were calling attention to the FBI searches, as well.\n\n\"The systemic corruption in South Texas must end,\" said Ed Cabrera, a businessman and rancher. \"When one of our highest rank official's home and office is raided by the FBI, it indicates the lack of respect for the rule of law in Democrat-led Districts.\"\n\nSteven Fowler, a former Air Force pilot, predicted it would make it \"much harder\" for Cuellar to win his primary against Cisneros.\n\n\"We simply cannot risk AOC 2.0 representing us in South Texas,\" Fowler said.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee issued a statement saying: \"What's Henry Cuellar hiding?\"", "source": {"uri": "houstonchronicle.com", "dataType":

The indictment, returned by a grand jury on Tuesday and unsealed on Friday, alleges that from December 2014 through at least November 2021, Cuellar and his wife accepted close to $600,000 in bribes from Azerbaijan and the bank, which was not named.\n\nThe indictment said the bribes were laundered through sham consulting contracts and into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. In exchange, it says the congressman sought to use his public position to influence U.S. foreign policy in Azerbaijan's favor and to pressure U.S. government officials to help the bank lobby against anti-money laundering enforcement policies that threatened its business. Ahead of the indictment on Friday, Cuellar issued a statement denying the allegations.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, said in a statement. Cuellar, regarded as one of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, is seeking an 11th two-year term.

Henry Cuellar to Be Indicted By the DOJ, Putting His House Seat in Jeopardy", "body": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas is facing an imminent indictment from the DOJ related to his business relationship with the nation of Azerbaijan.\n\nAs RedState reported, Cuellar's home was raided back in January of 2022, with FBI agents carrying out boxes of materials. At the time, the House member pledged to \"fully cooperate,\" stating that he wanted to see justice and the law upheld.\n\nThat didn't save him from the consequences of the investigation.\n\nThe Department of Justice intends to indict Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas on Friday, sources familiar with the investigation have told Fox News Digital.\n\nCuellar won his last race against Republican Cassy Garcia in TX-28, an area that has seen a significant shift toward the GOP due to the border crisis. Even leading up to that race, the Democrat was hounded by accusations that he had taken money from a Mexican politician connected to the drug cartels.\n\nAs to his dealings with Azerbaijan that have made his indictment imminent, the details are still unknown. Cuellar's lawyer announced in April that he was not the target of the investigation, a statement that appears to have been false.\n\nDespite the coming indictment, Cuellar has pledged to run for re-election anyway. That's good news for Republicans who are seeking to make inroads in the once-Democrat stronghold. Garcia had previously been critical of the Biden administration's border policies in an attempt to hold back the political tide.\n\nGiven how much worse the border has gotten since 2022, his re-election chances could be in trouble when coupled with these latest legal woes.

Cuellar from Congress", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) today called on the U.S. House to immediately expel Henry Cuellar (D-TX) over his indictment for accepting nearly six hundred thousand dollars in Azerbaijani bribes. The indictment, only recently unsealed, presents detailed accusations that Rep. Cuellar, who serves as co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, accepted substantial payments from Azerbaijani state-controlled entities in return for advancing pro-Azerbaijan legislation.\n\n\"We call on the U.S. House to immediately vote to expel Henry Cuellar, condemn Azerbaijan's brazen interference in our American democracy, and enact statutory measures to prevent ongoing attempts by Azerbaijan's corrupt Aliyev family to rig U.S. foreign policy in its favor,\" said Aram Hamparian, Executive Director of the ANCA. \"We have, for more than a decade now, fought Henry Cuellar at the ballot box and battled his genocide-enabling legislation on Capitol Hill - always shining a national spotlight on this foreign breach of the American public trust. By all accounts, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nAccording to the federal indictment, unsealed earlier today, Rep. Cuellar and his wife are accused of receiving over $598,000 from an Azerbaijani state-owned oil company and other foreign entities in exchange for advancing Azerbaijani interests within the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe indictment explicitly states, \"With respect to Azerbaijan, in exchange for the bribe payments, Henry Cuellar promised to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan. Henry Cuellar agreed, among other things, to influence a series of legislative measures relating to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia; to insert language favored by Azerbaijan into legislation and committee reports governing certain security and economic aid programs; to deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the House of Representatives; and to consult with representatives of Azerbaijan regarding their efforts to lobby the United States government.\"\n\nIn January 2013, Rep. Cuellar went on a trip to Turkey and Azerbaijan, facilitated by Azerbaijani connections, where he engaged with high-ranking Azerbaijani officials and business leaders. That trip, which was reported to cost close to $20,000, was covered by the Turquoise Council of Americans and Eurasians, chaired by Kemal Oksuz, who was subsequently convicted for concealing the fact that other trips to Azerbaijan, organized by his group later that year, were actually paid for by SOCAR, the government-funded oil company of Azerbaijan. Rep. Cuellar's trip laid the groundwork for subsequent corrupt dealings highlighted in the charges.\n\nThe communication exchanges between Rep. Cuellar and Azerbaijani officials revealed in today's indictment paint a stark picture of collusion. In response to an Azerbaijani diplomat's request for assistance with U.S. legislation, Cuellar indicated readiness to help, stating he would \"try [his] best\" to influence legislative outcomes favorably for Azerbaijan. This included efforts to modify legislative language in ways that supported Azerbaijan's geopolitical interests over Armenia's.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Cuellar communicated directly with Azerbaijani officials to discuss strategies for overriding Armenian interests in Congress. In one email, an Azerbaijani diplomat expressed gratitude, stating, \"Thank you, Congressman! This is good indeed,\" acknowledging Cuellar's efforts to steer U.S. policy in Azerbaijan's favor. Azerbaijani diplomats reportedly referred to Rep. Cuellar as \"el Jefe\" or \"Boss\" in text messages.\n\nThe indictment further uncovers how Rep. Cuellar agreed to insert pro-Azerbaijan speeches into congressional records and to advance legislation that would undermine U.S. aid to Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh). In one email, Cuellar promised Azerbaijani contacts to \"set up a meeting\" with U.S. defense officials to discuss matters benefiting Azerbaijan, directly linking his legislative actions to the bribes received.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, Rep. Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, surrendered to authorities on Friday. After an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston, they were released on $100,000 bond each.\n\nCharges against Rep. Cuellar and his wife include bribery, conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they can spend decades in prison and may need to forfeit property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.", "source": {"uri": "armenianweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Henry Cuellar has stood out as a moderate Democrat along the Texas-Mexico border, bucking his party at times over guns and immigration while seldom facing a tough reelection.\n\nBut a federal indictment accusing Cuellar of federal conspiracy and bribery charges is putting the Laredo native who was first elected in 2004 in a different spotlight. Cuellar, 68, and his wife, Imelda, 67, were taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nLet the news come to you\n\nGet any of our free email newsletters -- news headlines, obituaries, sports, and more.\n\nExplore newsletters\n\nFeatured Local Savings", "source": {"uri": "beloitdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beloit Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@beloitdailynews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alanna_durkin_richer@beloitdailynews.com", "name": "Alanna Durkin Richer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "valerie_gonzalez@beloitdailynews.com", "name": "Valerie Gonzalez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laredo,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republics of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism_and_Devolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism and Devolution", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/beloitdailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/3e/33e0688d-4c3c-517a-a3c0-98f287cc0fbe/66351db934fc1.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537117", "eventUri": "eng-9537117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-", "textStart": 88, "textEnd": 95}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Henry Cuellar, Wife Indicted for Bribery", "body": "The Department of Justice announced the indictment of U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar (D-TX) and his wife, Imelda, on charges of accepting bribes. Cuellar, the representative for Texas 28 Congressional District, has been in office since 2005. The indictment comes more than two years after agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation served a search warrant on Cuellar's Laredo home.\n\nDOJ officials stated that the congressman and his wife are charged with accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an energy company in Azerbaijan. Cuellar and his wife appeared before Magistrate Judge Dena Palermo in Houston.\n\nProsecutors claim the couple accepted the bribes from the energy company controlled by the Government of Azerbaijan and a bank located in Mexico City. The payments were laundered through sham consulting contracts. The congressman then provided influence for the energy company to affect U.S. foreign policy and to pressure U.S. Executive Branch officials to benefit the bank's interest, prosecutors stated.\n\nIn January 2022, Cuellar's home on Estate Drive in Laredo was raided by federal authorities. At the time of the raid, Breitbart Texas contacted Cuellar's Office who confirmed the search warrant was executed at the address and added that \"Congressman Cuellar will fully cooperate in any investigation. He is committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld,\" according to Cuellar's Press Secretary Dana Yougentob.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press news report shortly after the raid, Cuellar's attorney Joshua Berman issued a statement indicating the congressman was not the target of the investigation according to federal authorities. According to law enforcement authorities, the raid on Cuellar's residence in 2022 was in connection to an ongoing federal investigation related to Azerbaijan and improprieties involving U.S. businessmen with the country. It remains unclear as to the connection between the alleged indictment and the ongoing investigation into Azerbaijan.\n\nAt the time of the raids, Cuellar was the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus. According to the CIA world factbook, the oil-rich nation is predominantly Muslim and has a history of corruption. The factbook describes issues within the country stating:\n\nSince gaining its independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has significantly reduced the poverty rate and has directed some revenue from its oil and gas production to develop the country's infrastructure. However, corruption remains a burden on the economy, and Western observers and members of the country's political opposition have accused the government of authoritarianism.\n\nIn a statement issued by Cuellar on Friday, the congressman says he and his wife are innocent of any allegations that have surfaced in recent media reports and continues to deny any wrongdoing.\n\nIn the statement, Cuellar said \"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\" The congressman continues to seek re-election this November.\n\nThe Cuellars face the following charges, according to the DOJ:\n\nTwo counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official and to have a public official act as an agent of a foreign principal, five years in prison on each count; two counts of bribery of a federal official, 15 years in prison on each count; two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, 20 years in prison on each count; two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal, two years in prison on each count; one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering, 20 years in prison; and five counts of money laundering, 20 years in prison on each count.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_price@breitbart.com", "name": "Bob Price",

Henry Cuellar (D-TX) at House Appropriations Subcommittee on April 27, 2022 in Washington, DC. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nOne of the most conservative members of the House Democratic caucus -- and its only avowed opponent of abortion -- is expected to soon be indicted by the Department of Justice, NBC News reported Friday.\n\nHenry Cuellar has represented his San Antonio-area district since 2004 but has been under a cloud of suspicion for the last two years following FBI raids on his home and office. It is not clear what charges he could face, but The Texas Tribune noted that investigators are believed to be interested in his ties to Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic that is rich in oil and gas.\n\nIn a statement, Cuellar said he and his wife \"are innocent of these allegations,\" without specifying what those allegations are. \"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people,\" he said.\n\nA self-styled centrist, Cuellar has long angered pro-choice activists.

I've devoted my life's work to creating jobs here, improving education, and securing our border.\"\n\nThe FBI said at the time in a statement to media outlets that the bureau \"was present in Laredo conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity,\" without elaborating.\n\nMr. Cuellar, 66, has represented Texas's 28th Congressional District since 2005.

Cuellar faces bipartisan call to resign -- and his...", "body": "Indicted Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar is now facing a bipartisan call to resign from Congress.\n\nReps. Mike Lawler and Jeff Van Drew on Saturday became the first sitting Republicans to say the Texas moderate should step down in the wake of his federal bribery charges.\n\nWhether Cueller decides to stay or go, Dems will almost certainly be stuck with him on the ballot for the November election -- meaning that the charges could potentially help Republicans keep control of the House in 2024.\n\n\"If you've been indicted by the DOJ, you should resign for the good of the institution,\" Lawler (R-NY), a first-term congressman representing Rockland County, told The Post.\n\n\"Everyone has a right to their day in court, but with trust in Congress at an all-time low we must hold members to a higher standard and put the integrity of the institution above all other considerations.\"\n\nVan Drew (R-NJ), a former Democrat, concurred.\n\n\"What concerns Americans most when it comes to corruption is influence peddling, that he would sell the United States down the river to make financial gains for himself,\" Van Drew said. \"I think he's not going to be able to really function with this huge dark cloud over him.\"\n\nCuellar and his wife, Imelda, were charged Friday in a Houston federal court over claims they took $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijani oil and gas company and a Mexican bank between 2014 and 2021.\n\nThe Cuellars were hit with multiple counts of bribery, wire fraud, and money laundering for allegedly accepting bribes through \"shell companies\" owned by Imelda. The charges carry a maximum penalty of up to 204 years in federal prison.\n\nThe two Republicans' calls came hours after Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn) bucked his party leadership by urging Cuellar to leave Congress.\n\n\"While the bar for Federal indictment is high, trust in government is at an all-time low,\" Phillips told Axios Friday. \"That's why I believe any elected official or candidate facing such charges should resign or end their campaign.\"\n\nBut House Democratic leadership is standing by Cuellar, a nine-term incumbent in a border district that has been roiled by the migrant crisis.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus,\" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) after the indictment was announced.\n\n\"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process,\" Jeffries said.\n\nCuellar won re-election easily in 2022, but his once-solid Dem district has been trending Republican in recent years -- and a flip of his seat could keep the House in GOP hands.\n\nCuellar is vying for his 10th term this November, after winning an uncontested Democratic Party primary in March.\n\n\"Since he is the nominee, he could resign from Congress but there is no replacing him on the ballot,\" said Texas election lawyer Eric Opiela. If Cuellar dropped out of the race, Democrats would be forced to run a write-in candidate instead, he said.\n\nIf Cuellar does opt to resign, Texas state law would not allow Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, to fill the seat or call a special election, Opiela said -- leaving the seat to sit empty until the next congress is sworn in.\n\nMeanwhile, ex-Rep. George Santos -- who was ousted from Congress in December after a blistering report from the House Committee on Ethics alleged he \"blatantly stole from his campaign\" and lied to donors -- had a harsher message for his former colleagues.\n\n\"Expel him!\" Santos said. \"Isn't that the new normal?\"\n\n\"But the Democrats won't do it because if they do, that seat will flip Republican,\" he continued. \"And the Republicans won't force it because they lack the testicular fortitude to follow through with what they claim to be their principles.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

And in return for the bribes, Henry Cuellar - who has represented a swath of Texas's border with Mexico in Congress since 2005 - steered US foreign policy to Azerbaijan's advantage while pressuring unnamed \"high-ranking\" federal government executives to implement measures benefiting the bank.\n\nIn a statement, Henry Cuellar maintained his and his wife's innocence. \"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" the congressman's statement said. \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of south Texas.\"\n\nFriday's announcement from prosecutors prompted the House Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, to say that Cuellar would step down as the ranking member of a homeland security subcommittee while the case against him proceeded. Jeffries cited the party's rules in the House.\n\nHowever, Jeffries made it a point to describe Cuellar as \"a valued member of the House Democratic caucus\" who was \"entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process\".\n\nPhillips did not concur, in his estimation lumping in Cuellar with Menendez and Trump as politicians who did not deserve to hold elected office as they grappled with criminal charges.\n\nMenendez has pleaded not guilty to federal corruption charges - he has said he doesn't plan to run for re-election as a Democrat but hasn't ruled out an independent candidacy.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to nearly 90 felonies for trying to subvert the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Biden, improper retention of classified materials after his presidency and hush-money payments to an adult film actor that prosecutors allege were improperly covered up.\n\nThe former president's trial centering on the hush money concluded its third week on Friday. He is the Republican party's presumptive nominee for November's presidential race.\n\nOne indicted politician who recently did not leave his position on his own terms was George Santos, who was expelled from the US House amid fraud-related charges.\n\nPhillips mounted a long-shot bid to deny Biden from winning a second consecutive Democratic nomination seemingly against the advice of most of his party colleagues.\n\nBiden dominated the contest, and Phillips dropped out after losing his home state.\n\nPhillips was first elected to Congress to represent a wealthier suburban area outside Minneapolis in 2019 but gave up seeking re-election in November to pursue his challenge to Biden.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

That became clear Friday when the Department of Justice indicted one of a handful of Democrats daring to go rogue on the issue.\n\nJust before the Justice Department's action, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas had joined 13 rebellious Democrats voting in favor of H. Res. 1112, a symbolic measure accusing President Biden of \"purposely violating statutes that require the detention of inadmissible aliens\" and denouncing \"the Biden administration's open-borders policies.\"\n\nBecause the Laredo congressman has a track record of backing modest measures to strengthen border security -- he never went as far as to endorse a border wall -- he invited the ire of progressives who wanted him gone.\n\nThe Justice Democrats, the far-left PAC that helped elevate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, mounted a primary challenge against Mr. Cuellar. The Intercept published a series of articles accusing him of being strong-ish on the border because he was receiving donations from border-security technology companies.\n\nThe Justice Department now says Mr. Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, pocketed $360,000 in bribes from SOCAR, the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Mr. Cuellar opened his relationship with that former Soviet republic when he visited in 2013.\n\nThe authoritarian regime in Baku was eager to line up Washington's support for a lucrative natural gas pipeline, and Mr. Cuellar did add his name to be one of 59 co-sponsors of a bipartisan resolution endorsing its construction.\n\nFederal prosecutors are saying the foreigners made \"consulting fee\" payments to a shell company set up by Mrs. Cuellar. Despite being a highly paid consultant to a foreign gas company, Mrs. Cuellar had no experience in this line of business.\n\nNote that the Justice Department is not interested in drawing comparisons to payments made by Ukrainian natural gas interests to close family members of then-Vice President Biden in return for official actions of consequence. That's different, apparently.\n\nIn Mr. Cuellar's case, he allegedly fired off a few letters to the White House supporting the Muslim-majority nation in its long-standing feud with Armenia. He also sought State Department help in obtaining a U.S. passport for the daughter of an Azerbaijani diplomat, and he allegedly made moves to block a pro-Armenian resolution authored by a fellow congressional Democrat.\n\nThe FBI raided Mr. Cuellar's home and office on Jan. 19, 2022, so this indictment has been looming. Even so, many prominent Democrats campaigned on Mr. Cuellar's behalf in the last election cycle. Remember that in November, when the same Democrats say voters can't trust Donald Trump because he has been indicted.\n\nMr. Cuellar insists he is innocent, and he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt -- though it doesn't look good. His conduct may not be out of the ordinary in Washington's corridors of power, but he gave up the immunity the Justice Department grants to politicians who carry water for the Democrats.\n\nTexas Republicans will hold a runoff on May 28 to decide whether retired naval aviator Jay Furman or rancher Lazaro Garza Jr. will challenge Mr. Cuellar in November. The chance for this to become a Republican pickup just went up considerably.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Congressman Cuellar and Imelda Cuellar made their initial court appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Dena Palermo in Houston.\n\nAccording to court documents, beginning in at least December 2014 and continuing through at least November 2021, Congressman Cuellar and Imelda Cuellar allegedly accepted approximately $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities: an oil and gas company wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Azerbaijan, and a bank headquartered in Mexico City. The bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts. In exchange for the bribes paid by the Azerbaijani oil and gas company, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan. In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank.\n\nCongressman Cuellar and Imelda Cuellar are each charged with the following offenses, and if convicted, face maximum penalties as indicated: two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official and to have a public official act as an agent of a foreign principal required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), five years imprisonment on each count; two counts of bribery of a federal official, 15 years imprisonment on each count; two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, 20 years imprisonment on each count; two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal required to register under FARA, two years imprisonment on each count; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, 20 years imprisonment; and five counts of money laundering, 20 years imprisonment on each count.\n\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M.

Henry Cuellar (D-TX) is being called on to step down by a Democrat colleague in the House.\n\nRep. Dean Phillips (D-MN), a former long-shot candidate for president, lumped Cuellar in with former President Donald Trump and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) as part of a list of politicians who he insisted should resign because they have been indicted.\n\n\"While the bar for Federal indictment is high, trust in our government is low,\" Phillips said in a post to X. \"That's why office holders and candidates under indictment should resign or end their campaigns, including Sen. Bob Menendez, Donald Trump, & Rep. Henry Cuellar.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Friday that Cuellar, a 10-term congressman, and his wife Imelda were charged with allegedly participating in schemes involving bribery, unlawful foreign influence, and money laundering.\n\nCuellar, 68, accepted $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities -- an energy company controlled by Azerbaijan and a bank headquartered in Mexico City -- in exchange for official acts as a member of Congress, the DOJ said.\n\nIn a statement responding to the indictment, Cuellar said he and his wife were \"innocent of these allegations,\" taking a similarly defiant stance as Trump and Menendez have as they seek to fend off the charges they face.\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nHe added, \"Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.\"\n\nThe DOJ said the Cuellars, who face decades in prison if convicted, surrendered to authorities on Friday and made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston before each being released on $100,000 bond, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMenendez, who also faces bribery-related charges, has also been pressured to step down by a fellow Democrat -- Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) -- amid his legal battle.\n\n\"Senator Menendez should resign,\" Fetterman said in a statement. \"He's entitled to the presumption of innocence under our system, but he is not entitled to continue to wield influence over national policy, especially given the serious and specific nature of the allegations. I hope he chooses an honorable exit and focuses on his trial.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dean Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presumption of innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/05/GettyImages-1249139543-scaled-e1714925918743.jpg?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537117", "eventUri": "eng-9537117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Gerrymandering and voter suppression laws passed by Republican state legislatures. Lack of enthusiasm for the presidential race becoming a drag on some of the down-ballot races. Mercury being in retrograde for most of August.\n\nOh, and that asshole Rep. Henry Cuellar getting indicted on federal bribery and money laundering charges, thus endangering control of his D+3 district in an election where the winning party might very well only have a two- or three- or some other ridiculously low number-seat advantage. Great job, likely nominee for Wonkette's Legislative Shitmuffin of the Year award!\n\nCuellar and his wife, Imelda (a name that probably should have been a flashing warning light), are accused of taking roughly $600,000 in bribes over the last decade or so from a Mexican bank and an Azerbaijani oil and gas company. The bribes were allegedly paid by laundering them through a bunch of shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar and disguised as payments for nonexistent consulting services.\n\nFrom NBC News:\n\n\"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Azerbaijani oil and gas company, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan,\" DOJ continued. \"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank.\"\n\nThe indictment is here in case anyone feels like spending a lovely weekend reading the grubby particulars. Don't skip the part where the DOJ alleges the Cuellars used laundered funds from one of the shell companies to pay their taxes and $58,000 worth of credit card charges. Nothing as exciting as, say, keeping gold bars given to you by shady Egyptian businessmen in your house or carrying on affairs with women who are not your wife or stealing your donors' credit card numbers to buy cashmere sweaters at Prada or wherever the hell George Santos likes to shop, but it is still fun to imagine how fancy of a custom gown $12,000 of Azerbaijani money bought them.\n\nCuellar has been under investigation since 2022, when the feds raided his house and campaign office as part of an investigation into his relationship with an Azerbaijani businessman. That helped boost one of his primary opponents, Jessica Cisneros, in a close race. Cisneros was an actual progressive, as opposed to the anti-abortion, immigration hardliner Cuellar. As is standard tradition in the Democratic Party, congressional leadership parachuted in to campaign for the incumbent. One day maybe leadership will rethink that tradition? Eh, probably not.\n\nAnyway, the primary was close enough that it went to a runoff, where Cuellar beat Cisneros by a little under 300 votes. Imagine the angst the Democrats could have spared themselves if they had helped get this schmuck out of office two years ago.\n\nCuellar swears, by the way, that facing 20 years in prison will not stop him from running for re-election in November, probably because 20 more years serving with Marjorie Taylor Greene might be punishment enough for all the crimes with which he's charged.\n\nRemarkably, the Cuellars are only the second Democratic congressional couple to be charged with a whole plethora of white collar crimes in the last nine months. Googly-eyed Sen. Bob Menendez's trial begins on Monday, and he reportedly is going to throw his wife, who is being tried separately later in the summer, under the bus.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\nDefense attorneys said Menendez could take the stand in his own defense and implicate his wife by suggesting she kept information from him and he was unaware of her allegedly illegal activities.\n\nWomen, amirite? Can't live with 'em, can't believe 'em when they tell you the bars of gold stashed around the house are merely Hanukkah gelt.\n\nSo far, Democratic leaders are standing behind Cuellar, which luckily has never backfired on them before.", "source": {"uri": "wonkette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonkette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_legum@wonkette.com", "name": "Gary Legum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coattail effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerrymandering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voter suppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shell corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Santos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashmere_wool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cashmere wool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Cisneros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Cisneros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fwonkette.substack.com%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fpost_preview%2F144295281%2Ftwitter.jpg%3Fversion%3D4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537117", "eventUri": "eng-9537117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Charged With Participating in International Bribery Scheme", "body": "The Department of Justice has charged Democratic Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar with participating in a scheme to commit \"bribery, unlawful foreign influence, and money laundering,\" according to an indictment unsealed Friday.\n\nCuellar and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, are accused of accepting \"approximately $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities: an oil and gas company wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Azerbaijan, and a bank headquartered in Mexico City.\"\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, Cuellar \"allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan,\" and \"influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank.\" The scheme began in 2014 and continued through at least November 2021.\n\nCuellar and his wife have each been charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official; two counts of bribery of a federal official; two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud; two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal; one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering; and five counts of money laundering. The couple could each face a maximum of more than 200 years in prison if convicted on all counts.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said in a statement on Friday. \"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm. The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\n\"Let me be clear, I'm running for re-election and will win this November,\" he added.\n\nThe Texas representative is the latest in a spate of congressional lawmakers facing criminal indictments. In September, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) was charged with conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, and conspiracy to commit extortion. Prosecutors alleged that Menendez and his wife, Nadine, had \"agreed to and did accept hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes in exchange for using Menendez's power and influence as a Senator to seek to protect and enrich\" three businessmen: Wael Hana, Jose Uribe, and Fred Daibes. The charges included allegations that Menendez had abused his post to unlawfully aid the government of Egypt, and showed that investigators had found envelopes of cash and even solid bars of gold stashed throughout the senator's home.\n\nIn October and March, prosecutors leveled additional charges against Menendez, accusing him of having illegally provided sensitive information to the governments of Egypt and Qatar. Despite the maelstrom of legal issues surrounding his position in the Senate, Menendez has been steadfast in his refusal to resign and is expected to stand trial later this month.\n\nFormer Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) was indicted and arrested last May on charges of wire fraud, money laundering, and lying to Congress. In October the former congressman -- already disgraced as a serial liar -- was slapped with 23 additional counts related to an alleged credit card fraud scheme.\n\nSantos was ultimately expelled from Congress in December after a damning report by the House Ethics Committee found \"substantial\" evidence that Santos had committed a slew of alleged crimes, and had used campaign funds at Herm\u00e8s, OnlyFans, and Sephora, as well as for meals, parking, Botox, a luxury vacation in the Hamptons, honeymoon expenses, spa treatments, and to pay off his credit card bills.\n\nDemocrats in Congress are already reacting to the news of Cuellar's indictment. On Friday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) issued a statement affirming that \"Cuellar has admirably devoted his career to public service and is a valued Member of the House Democratic Caucus. Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process.\"\n\nJefferies added that Cuellar would be taking a leave from his position as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee until the case is resolved.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"},

According to Benen, a weaponized DOJ wouldn't be going after a high-ranking elected member of Congress from its own party -- particularly when control of the House of Representatives will come down to just a handful of seats nationwide.\n\n\"Republicans don't just want their conspiracy theory to be true; they need it to be true,\" Benen said. \"This simple, baseless idea is the foundation for the party's Trump defense, fundraising, stump speeches, cable news segments, and even legislative campaigns on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Sen. Menendez may throw his wife under the bus in bribery scandal: report\n\n\"In 2024, assertions about a 'two-tiered' justice system are foundational to GOP politics. They're also routinely discredited by real-world events,\" he continued. \"Indeed, if Biden and his team were trying to weaponize federal law enforcement to benefit Democrats, they've proved themselves to be incredibly bad at it.\"\n\nBenen's op-ed went on to explain how under Attorney General Merrick Garland's leadership, the DOJ has indicted other prominent Democrats on numerous felony charges, including Sen. Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) and Hunter Biden. Garland's DOJ is also investigating other Democratic elected officials across the country like Rep. Cori Bush (D-Missouri) and New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n\n\"In advance of the 2018 elections, Donald Trump complained bitterly about federal law enforcement charging two of his congressional allies, and the then-president whined about the Justice Department undermining the Republican Party's electoral plans,\" Benen wrote.\n\n\"Six years later, federal law enforcement is prosecuting two Democratic members of Congress, potentially undermin[ing] their party's electoral plans, and Biden is taking a responsible, hands-off approach,\" he added.\n\nREAD MORE: Special counsel seeks to indict Hunter Biden on gun charges: report\n\nSince his indictment, Cuellar has stepped down from his position as the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee. He has so far not indicated plans to resign from Congress.\n\n\"\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar stated. \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nCuellar, who is among the more conservative members of the House Democratic Caucus, narrowly survived a primary challenge from progressive activist Jessica Cisneros in 2022, winning by just a few hundred votes. His photo-finish victory may have been due to House Democratic leadership closing ranks around him amid Cisneros' attacks on Cuellar's anti-abortion record. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) praised Cuellar in 2022 even after the FBI raided his home.\n\n\"I support my incumbents,\" Pelosi said at the time. \"I support every one of them, from right to left. That is what I do.\"", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type":

George Santos needled two Democratic members of Congress on Saturday over a recently unveiled indictment by the Department of Justice against Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX).\n\nThe Texas Democrat and his wife were indicted Friday over allegations that they accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities, the government of Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank.\n\nThey each face 14 charges, including bribery, conspiracy, and money laundering.\n\nSantos used the occasion to go after House members who introduced a resolution in February 2023 to expel him from Congress. He became the sixth member of the House to be forced out of Congress last December.\n\n\"So here's the thing... is miss thang @RepRobertGarcia going to draft an expulsion resolution for Henry Cuellar?\" Santos posted on X Saturday morning. \"Inquiring minds want to know.\"\n\n\"Hey @RitchieTorres are you going to draft an expulsion resolution for Henry Cuellar?\" Santos wrote in another post on X. \"Or is that just for republicans who flip seats? Inquiring minds want to know.\"\n\nIn March, Torres said he would introduce the \"Getting Expelled Officially Revokes Guaranteed Entry\" Rule after Santos made a surprise appearance during President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.\n\nThe \"GEORGE\" Rule would prohibit former House members who had been voted out from using their privileges to gain floor access.\n\nRep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) became the first Democrat to publicly call for Cuellar's ouster Friday evening.\n\n\"While the bar for Federal indictment is high, trust in our government is low,\" Phillips wrote on X. \"That's why office holders and candidates under indictment should resign or end their campaigns, including Sen. Bob Menendez, Donald Trump, & Rep.

He says he's innocent. We'll have to see how this story ends up playing out in terms of whether he'll resign and how it'll impact the House majority. But for now there's a different aspect of this story that jumps off the page.\n\nThe Henry Cuellar scandal isn't new. In fact it's quite an old story. The Feds raided Cuellar's home and office at the beginning 2022, nearly two and a half years ago. And then, as often tends to happen in federal criminal probes, nothing happened - at least not within public view. The probe presumably continued behind closed doors, and after an additional two and a half years of evidence gathering, Cuellar is now finally being indicted.\n\nThis serves as a reminder that just because we don't hear anything out of a federal criminal investigation for a couple years, it doesn't mean it's not ongoing. A lack of recent news about a federal criminal investigation is never a basis for presuming the case has been dropped. That goes for every political figure out there, on either side, who has been reported to be under federal criminal investigation at any point.\n\nHere's the real kicker. At one point Henry Cuellar's attorney told the media that the Feds had informed Cuellar that he was not the target of the investigation. Yet now he's being indicted. There are other members of Congress who have come under federal criminal investigation who have since claimed that they've been informed by the Feds that they've been cleared. Such claims clearly don't mean anything, and shouldn't be given any weight by us.\n\nThe bottom line: federal criminal investigations are ongoing until they're not. They can be ongoing for years. They can result in a criminal indictment even after it's gone on for so long that everyone forgot the person was even under investigation.

Henry Cuellar today became the second sitting member of Congress hit with charges of illegally acting as a foreign agent -- the latest indication that the Justice Department is plowing ahead with its intensified focus on foreign influence campaigns. DOJ alleges in an indictment unsealed this afternoon that the lawmaker and his wife Imelda took $600,000 in bribes in a yearslong scheme in exchange for taking actions benefiting the Azerbaijani government and a Mexican bank.\n\n-- Cuellar, in a statement hours before the charges were unveiled, maintained the couple's innocence and pledged that he will still seek reelection this fall, our colleagues Daniella Diaz and Nick Wu write.\n\n-- The indictment comes weeks before Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) is set to go on trial to fight a similar set of charges against the senator and his wife for allegedly accepting bribes, including gold bars, cash and luxury cars, in exchange for taking actions to benefit the Egyptian and Qatari governments.\n\n-- The charge against a sitting lawmaker for violating a ban on public officials acting as a foreign agent appeared at the time to be without precedent, and DOJ adding another current member of Congress to that list in a matter of months signals that its yearslong campaign to crack down on foreign influence campaigns is far from over.\n\n-- According to prosecutors, from 2014 to 2021, the Cuellars funneled the bribes from an oil and gas company owned by the Azerbaijani government and a bank headquartered in Mexico City through front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar \"pursuant to sham consulting contracts,\" under which she \"performed little to no legitimate work.\"\n\n-- In exchange, Henry Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan, including \"legislation relating to U.S. security and economic development programs, legislation and policy relating to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, immigration issues relating to an Azerbaijani citizen, and the promotion of Azerbaijan's reputation as an ally and strategic partner of the United States,\" according to the indictment.\n\n-- He also agreed to influence legislative activity and regulators in favor of the Mexican bank, prosecutors allege. The indictments come after the FBI raided the Cuellars' home and a Cuellar campaign office in early 2022, which was linked in news reports to a federal probe related to Azerbaijan.\n\n-- An attorney for Cuellar, a senior appropriator and former co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, said at the time Cuellar was not a target of that investigation.\n\nTGIF and welcome to PI.

Richard Burr (R-N.C.) will help lead a business coalition formed to fight back against the Biden administration's proposal to exercise so-called march-in rights in an effort to lower drug prices.\n\n-- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce launched the Business Alliance to Stop Innovation Confiscation (or BASIC) Coalition in March in response to the administration's determination late last year that the government has the authority to seize patents of certain high-priced drugs that were developed using taxpayer funding. Burr will serve as the coalition's co-chair alongside Paul Michel, a retired judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\n-- The business, intellectual property and venture capital communities have warned the move could open the door for this administration or future administrations to use the same justification to seize patents for other emerging tech like clean energy -- and that it would have a chilling effect on new research and development.\n\n-- \"This mission, which is to safeguard private property rights from unwarranted government seizure and to staunchly defend the principles of free enterprise, resonates deeply with me,\" Burr said in a statement, calling \"the proposed misuse of march-in rights\" a \"matter of grave concern.\"\n\n-- Burr served in Congress for nearly three decades, including as ranking member of the Senate HELP Committee. After leaving Congress last year, he joined law and lobbying firm DLA Piper to lead its health policy strategic consulting practice and serve as a principal policy adviser in its regulatory and government affairs practice.\n\nBIOTECH'S HANDWRINGING: \"The biotech industry is in a bind when it comes to the BIOSECURE Act, bipartisan legislation that would effectively prohibit Chinese biotech companies from doing business in the U.S.,\" our Megan R. Wilson writes.\n\n-- \"Companies appearing to favor the bill risk angering Beijing, which has a penchant for corporate retaliation. Meanwhile, companies looking for carve-outs could look lax on national security.\"\n\n-- \"The dynamic is forcing companies to balance their desire to maintain access to China's massive market for drugs and other products with the concerns expressed by lawmakers, who intend to crack down on Chinese firms and want to protect Americans' genomic data and U.S. intellectual property.\"\n\nTIKTOK NOT OUT OF THE WOODS AT CHINA PANEL: The bipartisan heads of the House Select China Committee aren't letting up pressure on TikTok despite the enactment of a landmark measure to force Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell off the app, per The Wall Street Journal's Richard Vanderford. They are demanding the company face an FTC investigation for its lobbying campaign to deploy users against a potential ban.\n\n-- \"TikTok's plea to users to contact their representatives, which came amid debate on legislation on the app's fate, could violate federal law against deceptive business practices and child protection law, the leaders of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said Thursday in a letter to Federal Trade Commission head Lina Khan.\"\n\n-- \"'We are gravely concerned that an app controlled by the Chinese Communist Party appears to have the unfettered ability to manipulate the American public, including America's children,' committee Chairman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois congressman who is the committee's top Democrat, wrote to Khan.\"\n\n-- \"TikTok said that it doesn't believe it has violated the laws referenced by the representatives. The company uses standard 'age-gating' processes -- a means to stop young people from improperly using an app -- that follow FTC guidance, it said. Notifications went to users aged 18 and older, and users had multiple options to dismiss them, TikTok said.\"\n\nSPEAKING OF: Our Rebecca Kern reports the video app \"is poised to get new allies in its constitutional challenge\" to the new law from a pair of \"prominent free speech groups ... planning to defend the company and its 170 million U.S. users in court.\"\n\n-- The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and the Center for Democracy and Technology \"have both told POLITICO they see the law as unconstitutional and are considering legal action on the company's behalf. Knight is weighing whether to bring its own case, and CDT is considering filing a friend-of-the-court brief backing TikTok,\" meanwhile the ACLU and Electronic Frontier Foundation said they're assessing how they'll approach potential litigation.\n\n-- Noelle Huizenga has been promoted to vice president of public policy and communications at the National Religious Broadcasters.\n\n-- Mike French has started the Space Policy Group and joined BCG as a senior advisor on space. He previously was vice president for space policy at the Aerospace Industries Association and is an Obama NASA alum.\n\n-- Joe Bush is now deputy communications director for Sen. Jacky Rosen's Nevada Senate reelection campaign.

Here are some of the things. This is TPM's Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version.\n\nLet's take a break from the existential threat to democracy for a return to those thrilling days of yesteryear when run-of-the-mill political corruption was a big fat juicy target for prosecutors and muckrakers.\n\nA federal grand jury in Houston has indicted Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), the last remaining anti-abortion-rights Democrat in the House, in two alleged bribery schemes: one to benefit Azerbaijan and the other a Mexico City bank.\n\nCuellar and his wife Imelda were both charged in the almost-readable 14-count indictment, which lays out in great detail the alleged scheme to bribe Cuellar in return for favorable treatment of Azerbaijan, as CNN reports:\n\nAmong those promises, prosecutors allege Cuellar agreed to influence US policy through a \"series of legislative measures relating to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia,\" by giving a pro-Azerbaijani speech on the House floor, inserting language \"favored by Azerbaijan\" into legislation and committee reports, and advocating for \"series of legislative measures relating to Azerbaijan's conflict with neighboring Armenia.\n\nAs for the alleged bank scheme:\n\nThe Texas Democrat also allegedly promised to influence financial regulations in a way that would benefit the Mexican bank and its affiliates, including by working to pressure the Executive Branch on anti-money laundering enforcement practices that \"threatened\" their business interest and supporting revisions to the criminal money-laundering statutes.\n\nThe charges in the two schemes, which came after a 2022 raid of Cuellar's home and campaign office, largely parallel each other: conspiracy, bribery, honest services wire fraud, public official acting as an agent of a foreign principal, and money laundering.\n\nCuellar declared his innocence and intention to still seek re-election this year.\n\nTPM's Josh Kovensky is back at the courthouse in Manhattan this morning as the third week of testimony in the hush-money trial gets underway. We're closing in on the expected big witnesses - Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels - but no clear timetable for when to expect their testimony.\n\nTwo highlights from Friday's proceedings:\n\nA gentle reminder that juries are nearly impossible to read during trial and their verdicts are nearly impossible to reliably predict.\n\nTrump continues to work furiously to blame Joe Biden for his legal travails, even the state court ones over which Biden doesn't even have theoretical control. This weekend, Trump let loose in a private meeting: \"These people are running a Gestapo administration.\"\n\nRecently hired RNC lawyer Charlie Spies has already resigned in the face of displeasure from Donald Trump that Spies was previously critical of the 2020 Big Lie charade.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is expected to launch her bid this week to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), but for a variety of reasons - support for Johnson from House Democrats, drama-fatigue among Republicans, and MTG's own shortcomings - it's not likely to go anywhere.", "source": {"uri": "talkingpointsmemo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Talking Points Memo"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) any more.\n\nTexas state lawmakers padded the 28th Congressional District with extra Democratic votes after the 2020 Census in order to pack more Republicans in other districts, and he won a 14-point victory over his GOP challenger in 2022. Cuellar didn't even make it onto the NRCC's target list for the 2024 cycle.\n\nThat all changed Friday, when Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, were charged in an alleged $600,000 corruption scheme. The indictment has Republicans taking a second look at what could be a crucial flip as they seek to preserve and potentially expand their slim majority.\n\n\"Henry Cuellar does not put Texas first, he puts himself first. If his colleagues truly believe in putting 'people over politics,' they will call on him to resign. If not -- they are hypocrites whose statements about public service aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" NRCC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said in a statement first provided to POLITICO.\n\nCuellar proclaimed his family's innocence in a statement issued before the charges were even unsealed, and he vowed to seek re-election. He still does not know who his opponent will be -- the GOP primary is going to a May 28 runoff between Jay Furman and Lazaro Garza Jr. (Cuellar ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for the first time in six years.)\n\nGarza posted on Facebook: \"It is sad that corruption has always existed in South Texas. It is time to make a difference for the better!\" And Furman, in a video posted on Facebook, said \"this is what we're trying to kick out. It's time for these guys to go.\"\n\nValley whirl: Republicans have eyed the congressional seats along the Rio Grande as potential pick-ups in recent years, with Donald Trump doing unexpectedly well there in 2016 and with the post-redistricting flip of the 15th Congressional District, now represented by GOP Rep. Monica De La Cruz.\n\nThe NRCC and the Congressional Leadership Fund, the largest GOP super PAC focused on House races, have pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into three districts -- Cuellar's, De La Cruz's and the 34th, held by Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez.\n\nWhile one prominent forecaster moved his district slightly in the GOP's direction Friday, House Democratic leaders did not signal any immediate change in their posture toward Cuellar Friday, nor did another top backer, the Hispanic Caucus' BOLD PAC political arm. Cuellar's district isn't listed as a \"frontline\" district by the DCCC.\n\nA sidelined maverick: More immediate consequences will be felt inside the House Democratic Caucus, where Cuellar is seen as an influential moderate who often speaks out against the Biden administration when it comes to issues related to border and energy. He is also the only outspoken anti-abortion Democrat in the House.\n\nPursuant to House Democrats' rules, Cuellar is stepping down from his role as the senior Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee overseeing Homeland Security funding, a spokesperson for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday.\n\nThere's also inklings of recriminations among progressive Democrats, who saw the party establishment rally behind Cuellar during primary challenges in 2020 and 2022, when his abortion stance and the pending federal investigation became major issues. His opponent in both of those primary races -- attorney Jessica Cisneros, who lost by just 289 votes last cycle -- did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n-- Daniella Diaz and Nicholas Wu\n\nGOOD EVENING! Welcome to Inside Congress, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill, on this Friday, May 3, where we hope you enjoy your weekend!\n\nACTIVIST FLOOD BOGS DOWN HILL EMAIL\n\nSome Capitol Hill staffers are ready to give up on their government email accounts after being overwhelmed with emails they believe are being sent using an activist group's new AI-powered tool.\n\n\"Freepalestine.tools\" was built by Gen-Z For Change, a group aiming to \"leverage the power of social media to drive progressive change.\" It allows users to \"[a]utomatically send daily emails to your representatives using Apple Shortcuts, urging them to do everything in their power to stop this onslaught against the Palestinian people.\"\n\nOne House staffer reported getting more than 400 emails from a single sender over the course of a few weeks, and that's one sender out of thousands who each send multiple emails per day.\n\n\"I just can't be spending all my time going through this spam,\" said one Senate staffer, who like others describing the situation was granted anonymity to avoid exacerbating it.\n\nStats bear out the surge: In mid-April, the Senate's email system volume was up to 1.7 million messages per day from about 700,000 before October 2023. The House inbound email volume went from 658,000 emails per day to 1.2 million over a similar period. Gen-Z for Change tells Inside Congress that more than 70 million emails have been sent to staffers using their tool.\n\nEmail-based activism, of course, is nothing new, but the level of sophistication at work here, the staffers say, has made their email accounts useless to the point that they've moved much of their internal communication off of email, to Signal chats or other systems that aren't run by the House or Senate.\n\nThis tool, unlike previous mass email campaigns, changes the subject line and body of the emails slightly to confound typical methods for sorting and prioritizing emails.\n\nThat is very much by design, according to Elise Joshi, Gen-Z for Change's executive director. \"Our brilliant coders built a way to prevent offices from filtering away people's emails demanding a ceasefire and track the number of times the Apple Shortcut is used,\" she said.\n\nWhat's very much unclear is whether the flood of messages is doing anything but annoy low-level congressional staff, some of whom are blocking senders and setting filters for any email that mentions Israel or Palestine -- thus running the risk of missing critical emails from colleagues or constituents who are not using the automated tool.\n\nIt's been especially frustrating for aides to lawmakers who are aligned with the activists and have publicly supported a cease-fire in Gaza. The emails didn't slow or stop, some noted, when members voted against the House's standalone Israel aid bill or the Senate's combined foreign aid package.\n\n\"That speaks to the extent that this is just completely automated,\" a House aide working for a pro-ceasefire lawmaker said.\n\nJoshi said the tool is built to skip the 19 members who are signed on to a pro-cease-fire resolution filed by Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) shortly after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The freepalestine.tools website does not mention that criterion, nor do the emails it generates, according to staffers.\n\nIn a further complication, there's no Senate companion to Bush's resolution, meaning they are looking for senators to speak out in favor of a House vehicle. \"Sadly, we have yet to remove any Senate offices,\" Joshi said.\n\nTurns out the House didn't need a discharge petition to pass Ukraine aid, after all. But now that hot-button issue is settled, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is hoping to drum up some hype for a new discharge effort aimed at disaster victims.\n\nA petition filed earlier this week by Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) would set up floor consideration of the Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2023, which would provide tax relief for losses due to federally declared disasters.\n\n\"It's about time we took a vote to help our fellow taxpaying Americans in need,\" Steube said in a statement to Inside Congress. The bill was included in a major bipartisan tax package that the House passed earlier this year that is now languishing in the Senate, and House leaders, he said, won't bring it up as a standalone.\n\nThe 15 lawmakers who have signed on already are heavy on the Florida and California delegations, whose constituents disproportionately suffer losses due to weather-related disasters: Reps. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), Cory Mills (R-Fla.), Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.), Kat Cammack (R-Fla.), Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.), Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Jill Tokuda (D-Hawaii) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.).\n\nDischarge petitions are rarely successful, and they don't usually attract much majority-party support because of how they circumvent party leadership.\n\nMoskowitz's office said he signed on because \"disaster relief can never be politicized. Hurricanes, wildfires, and train derailments don't just impact Republicans or Democrats, they impact everyone.\"\n\nWhy Johnson is stuck with threats to end his speakership from Jordain Carney and Nicholas Wu\n\nMilitary documents contradict Republican Rep.

Cuellar allegedly accepted bribes for just under $600,000 from two foreign entities. It puts the Cuellars in the same class as Senator Menendez and the Biden family.\n\nThe DOJ claims that the payments were allegedly laundered through sham consulting contracts and a series of companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda. The companies did little or no legitimate work under the contracts.\n\nThat sounds like the Biden family.\n\nThe bribes came from an oil and gas company owned and controlled by the governments of Azerbaijan and Egypt.\n\nWe don't know if he's guilty, and everyone trusts Biden's DOJ or FBI. They are completely politicized.\n\nI'll give him the benefit of the doubt, especially since he's an outspoken critic of the border crisis. He blasted Biden. The day before he was indicted, he joined twelve other Democrats in denouncing the Biden administration's disastrous immigration policies. He is also pro-life and a target of the far left.\n\nThe AOC crowd wants him gone and has been investing in far-left candidates to run against him.\n\nRepresentative Cuellar has issued a statement as reported by the New York Post.

Certain violations are considered misdemeanors, with penalties of imprisonment of not more than six months, a fine of not more than US$5,000, or both\".\n\nJon Danilowicz, a former Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Bangladesh has become a propagandist in favor of Islamists and jihadists in Bangladesh by joining a vicious group named 'Right to Freedom', which is jointly funded by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI). Within the diplomatic and media circle in Bangladesh, Jon Danilowicz was known as an influential diplomat who made frantic bids in sabotaging the January 5, 2014 general elections in Bangladesh and plant an unelected coalition government of several members of the civil society, including a controversial editor of an English daily as well as members of Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami. He also made frantic bids in saving war criminals from being prosecuted.\n\nAccording to description of Jon Danilowicz on his LinkedIn profile: \"Thirty two years of reporting on and analyzing global political developments, managing justice sector assistance programs, and providing leadership in some of our most challenging diplomatic posts. Currently seeking to draw upon these international experiences to promote domestic political and economic development. Looking to leverage my background as a teacher, mentor, strategic thinker and practitioner to link the global with the local in my native New England\".\n\nAccording to his Twitter handle, Jon Danilowicz has been dedicatedly working against Bangladesh and ruling Awami League, proving, it is now his full-time job to spread nefarious propaganda against Bangladesh. In addition to such nefarious propaganda, Jon Danilowics has recently written a derogatory content against Bangladesh, which is published in his own website named 'South Asia Perspectives'.\n\nInterestingly, address of the 'South Asia Perspectives' website is 1015 15th St NW, Suite 600, Washington DC, 20005, whereas according to the website of 'Right to Freedom' its office also is at the same address, proving this website also is funded by BNP-Jamaat nexus.\n\nAccording to 'About Us' page of the 'South Asia Perspectives', this website is run by the same gang of BNP-Jamaat nexus such as William B Milam, BNP member Mushfiqul Fazal Ansarey, Jon Danilowicz and Sultan Muhammed Zakaria.\n\nMeanwhile, according to court documents, beginning in at least December 2014 and continuing through at least November 2021, Congressman Henry Cuellar and his wife Imelda Cuellar allegedly accepted approximately $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities: An oil and gas company wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Azerbaijan, and a bank headquartered in Mexico City.\n\nCharges included violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The indictment stated: \"Public officials, including Henry Cuellar and all Members of Congress, have a lawful and official duty not to be or act as an agent of a foreign principal required to register under FARA\".\n\nThe Marco Polo investigative group, which compiled and published a database of the Hunter Biden laptop, noted that DOJ official Jennifer Kennedy Gellie, who signed off on the FARA charges against Cuellar, \"refused\" to prosecute alleged violations of FARA by the Biden family.\n\nThe DOJ said in a press release announcing the indictment: \"The bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts. In exchange for the bribes paid by the Azerbaijani oil and gas company, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan. In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking US Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank\".\n\nIf convicted, the Cuellars face maximum penalties as indicated: two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official and to have a public official act as an agent of a foreign principal, five years in prison on each count; two counts of bribery of a federal official, 15 years in prison on each count; two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, 20 years in prison on each count; two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal, two years in prison on each count; one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering, 20 years in prison; and five counts of money laundering, 20 years in prison on each count.\n\nPart of the indictment was for violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which is a federal registration and disclosure statute that requires any person who agrees to act or acts in the United States as an \"agent of a foreign principal\" to register with the United States Attorney General if he or she agrees to engage or engages, directly or through another person, in certain types of conduct, such as political activities, political consulting, public relations, or publicity activities, for or in the interest of the foreign principal.\n\n\"Public officials, including Henry Cuellar and all Members of Congress, have a lawful and official duty not to be or act as an agent of a foreign principal required to register under FARA\", the DOJ's indictment said. \"At all times relevant to this Indictment, the House Ethics Manual, which was publicly available, stated, among other things, '[r]egardless of compensation, a public official may not act as an agent or attorney for . . . a foreign principal required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended, that is, generally, those individuals engaged in lobbying, political, or propaganda activities', citing Title 18, United States Code, Section 219.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyblitz.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blitz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tajul_islam@weeklyblitz.net", "name": "Tajul Islam", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Henry Cuellar came in January 2022, when the FBI showed up at his house as part of a \"court-authorized ongoing investigation.\" Local reporting added at the time that agents were seen \"taking cases and other items from the congressman's home,\" and the FBI was also present \"at a downtown building owned by Cuellar that reportedly houses his campaign office as well as other private businesses.\"\n\nIt seemed like only a matter of time before the public would learn about a possible indictment against the Texas Democrat. Two years later, that's precisely what happened. NBC News reported:\n\nThe newly unsealed indictment suggests the incumbent lawmaker, if convicted, is facing the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nEven before the federal charges were formally unveiled to the public, the congressman issued a statement professing his innocence. Cuellar also said he intends to run for re-election -- and expects to win.\n\nNevertheless, the ripple effects are significant. For one thing, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries's office announced the Cueller, in light of the new charges, will now have to step down as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee's appropriations panel.\n\nFor another, there are electoral considerations to keep in mind: Unless the congressman quits, which now appears unlikely, Cuellar will be the Democratic nominee in his district. He won re-election in 2022 by 14 points, but if local voters have a problem with the criminal charges, this race could become highly competitive in a hurry -- and in a cycle in which every seat matters, this is going to give Democratic leaders heartburn.\n\nBut as the political world digests the latest instance of a sitting member of Congress getting indicted, it's also worth pausing to reflect on the bigger picture.\n\nAs things currently stand, the Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney General Merrick Garland, is:\n\nFor good measure, it's probably worth mentioning that the Justice Department also appears to be investigating Eric Adams, the high-profile Democratic mayor of New York City.\n\nAnd yet, despite these developments, one of the animating concepts in contemporary Republican politics is that rascally Democrats have \"weaponized\" federal law enforcement to punish GOP figures and shield Democrats from accountability. The Justice Department and the FBI, leading Republican voices insist, are little more than political tools for the Biden White House and its fiendish allies.\n\nAs we've discussed, Republicans don't just want their conspiracy theory to be true; they need it to be true. This simple, baseless idea is the foundation for the party's Trump defense, fundraising, stump speeches, cable news segments, and even legislative campaigns on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn 2024, assertions about a \"two-tiered\" justice system are foundational to GOP politics. They're also routinely discredited by real-world events.\n\nIndeed, if Biden and his team were trying to weaponize federal law enforcement to benefit Democrats, they've proved themselves to be incredibly bad at it.\n\nIn advance of the 2018 elections, Donald Trump complained bitterly about federal law enforcement charging two of his congressional allies, and the then-president whined about the Justice Department undermining the Republican Party's electoral plans.\n\nSix years later, federal law enforcement is prosecuting two Democratic members of Congress, potentially undermine their party's electoral plans, and Biden is taking a responsible, hands-off approach.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Congressman Cuellar and Imelda Cuellar made their initial court appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Dena Palermo in Houston.\n\nAccording to court documents, beginning in at least December 2014 and continuing through at least November 2021, Congressman Cuellar and Imelda Cuellar allegedly accepted approximately $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities: an oil and gas company wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Azerbaijan, and a bank headquartered in Mexico City. The bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, who performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts. In exchange for the bribes paid by the Azerbaijani oil and gas company, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan. In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank.\n\nCongressman Cuellar and Imelda Cuellar are each charged with the following offenses, and if convicted, face maximum penalties as indicated: two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official and to have a public official act as an agent of a foreign principal required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), five years imprisonment on each count; two counts of bribery of a federal official, 15 years imprisonment on each count; two counts of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, 20 years imprisonment on each count; two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal required to register under FARA, two years imprisonment on each count; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, 20 years imprisonment; and five counts of money laundering, 20 years imprisonment on each count.\n\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division; Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen, head of the Justice Department's National Security Division; FBI; and DOS-OIG made the announcement.\n\nActing Deputy Chief Marco A.

A UN-brokered truce in April 2022 led to a significant reduction in hostilities, but the country has continued to grapple with severe economic challenges and political divisions.\n\nThe latest natural disaster is said to compound the challenges faced by a population already struggling with widespread poverty, malnutrition, and limited access to basic services. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hudaydah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanaa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanaa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiz", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taiz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798806", "eventUri": "eng-9798806", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": -0.592156862745098, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

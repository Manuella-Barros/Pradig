The worst predictions of the SNP winning just 15 seats may now not come to pass.\n\nHowever, Mr Swinney was not a success in his first stint as SNP leader, between 2000 and 2004, when he was ousted after overseeing two poor election results. Although a more seasoned politician now, he lacks the popular appeal of Ms Sturgeon.\n\nMany of the policy areas which will be debated in the election, such as education and health, are devolved to the Scottish Government at Holyrood. However, they are still likely to be debated in the general election campaign.\n\nHere is a look at what the SNP could include in its 2024 election manifesto:\n\nBefore he quit as First Minister, Humza Yousaf pledged that page one, line one of the manifesto will state: \"Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.\"\n\nFollowing a series of policies being adopted and quickly dropped, the SNP has settled on a plan to demand negotiations with the UK Government for another independence referendum if the party wins a majority of the 57 seats that will be contested in Scotland, following boundary changes.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that either Rishi Sunak or Sir Keir Starmer would agree to any such demand after the election. However, support for independence is polling much higher than backing for the SNP.\n\nThe SNP will hope the pledge will win back some of the independence supporters who have deserted the party in recent months and motivate them to turn out on election day.\n\nThe party has even proposed new logos with \"SNP independence\" or \"SNP for independence\" to appear on general election ballot papers.\n\nThe SNP has already made Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK thanks to their control of income tax bands and rates. For 2024/25 there are six income tax bands in Scotland compared to three south of the border.\n\nShona Robison, the SNP Finance Secretary, has made clear her opposition to the Chancellor's decision to cut personal taxes in his Autumn and Spring Budgets, arguing the funding should instead have been spent on public services.\n\nTo avoid another \"damaging decade\" of austerity, the SNP will argue for both Labour and the Tories to abandon their fiscal rules and focus on spending.\n\nThe SNP has previously supported full fiscal autonomy - Scotland having control over all taxation north of the border - as a stepping stone to independence.\n\nThe manifesto could propose the devolution of taxes such as National Insurance and inheritance tax with a view to hiking rates for wealthier Scots.\n\nIn addition to scrapping non-dom tax status, the SNP has called for the UK Government to increase capital gains tax, tax share buybacks and increase taxes on those earning more than \u00a3100,000.\n\nA \u00a312 billion wealth tax has also been proposed by the Nationalists, although there are scant details on how this would be assessed and collected.\n\nMs Robison has also called for a huge increase in capital spending, particularly on affordable housing, arguing this would stimulate economic growth.\n\nAmong their other spending proposals to help families with the cost of living are reintroducing mortgage interest tax relief, capping supermarket food prices, and copying the \u00a325-per-week Scottish Child Payment for poorer families across the UK.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe manifesto will likely point to the economic crisis that occurred during Liz Truss's short-lived government, and the UK's sluggish growth rates over recent years.\n\nIt is expected to argue that Scotland would perform much better after independence, highlighting growth rates in other small countries in Europe.\n\nHealth and social care\n\nAlthough control of the Scottish NHS is devolved to the SNP government, expect the party's manifesto to call for a massive increase in health spending in England. Ahead of March's Spring Budget, the Nationalists called for a \u00a315 billion increase.\n\nThis would generate an extra \u00a31.5 billion funding for the Scottish Government through the Barnett formula, which could be used on Scotland's struggling NHS.\n\nDefence and foreign affairs\n\nThe SNP has long called for the removal of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent from its Faslane base on the Clyde. Before the 2019 election, Nicola Sturgeon said it would be a red line for the SNP if it were to back any Labour government.\n\nThe SNP has generally supported the UK Government's stance on the Ukraine conflict but has taken a much more pro-Palestine stance about the Gaza crisis. Mr Yousaf, whose wife is Palestinian, has accused the Israelis of inflicting a \"collective punishment\" on the people of Gaza in response to the Hamas terror attack.\n\nExpect the manifesto to include demands for an immediate ceasefire and the creation of a separate Palestinian state.\n\nMr Yousaf recently urged Scots to vote SNP to \"exit Brexit\", in a rehash of the 2017 and 2019 election campaigns. More than six out of 10 Scots voted Remain in the EU referendum and more recent polling on the issue has suggested this stance has not changed.\n\nWith neither the Tories or Labour planning to rerun the referendum, expect the SNP manifesto to argue that the only way for Scotland to be part of the EU and to gain the benefits of the single market is to become independent.\n\nImmigration\n\nScotland's working age population is expected to shrink over the coming decades, creating a demographic timebomb with fewer working people to pay for services for a larger number of elderly pensioners.\n\nThe SNP favours a much more liberal immigration policy than the UK Government, including the return of free movement from the EU.\n\nIt also wants Holyrood to have powers to issue work permits to foreigners, based on the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. New working visas, five-year post-study visas and family visas with much lower barriers than the UK currently uses would be introduced.\n\nThe SNP has called for a much more welcome regime for asylum seekers and his government has argued that an independent Scotland would allow them to work and claim benefits.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe party has a difficult political tightrope to walk over the future of North Sea oil and gas, which is responsible for around 90,000 highly paid jobs in Scotland.\n\nAs part of the SNP's environmental agenda, it has argued for a presumption against further exploration being allowed. Mr Yousaf attacked the UK Government's decision last September to give the green light to Rosebank, the UK's largest untapped field.\n\nBut the Nationalists are facing a difficult fight to hold their seats in the north east of Scotland, where most of the oil jobs are based.\n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP's Westminster leader and Aberdeen South MP, is expected to exert pressure on Mr Yousaf to tone down some of the party's anti-oil rhetoric.\n\nThe SNP recently opposed Labour's plan to raise the windfall tax on fossil fuels from 75 per cent of excess profits to 78 per cent, while also extending it to 2029. He said there was \"extreme anger\" from people in the north east of Scotland at the proposal.\n\nThe SNP has repeatedly boasted of Scotland's wind power potential so expect the manifesto to propose an overhaul in the subsidy regime to achieve a massive expansion in the number of onshore and offshore turbines.\n\nThe Nationalists have also called on the UK Government to introduce a \u00a3400 annual energy bill discount for households and to scrap electricity and gas standing charges.\n\nA social energy tariff to assist households with disabled people with their energy bills would also be introduced, under their proposals.\n\nEnvironment\n\nMs Sturgeon and Mr Yousaf made the transition to net zero one of the tenets of their tenure as First Minister. The SNP is in coalition at Holyrood with the hard-Left Scottish Greens, who have two ministers in his government.\n\nThey have introduced legally binding targets for Scotland to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 - five years earlier than the UK as a whole. However, interim targets were recently scrapped, a move that contributed significantly to the divorce with the Greens.\n\nThe SNP has taken up Labour's abandoned plan to spend at least \u00a328 billion a year to \"turbocharge investment in green energy\".\n\nThe Scottish Nationalists opposed Rishi Sunak's decision to delay the ban on new petrol and diesel from 2030 to 2035.\n\nThe manifesto could also call for a UK-wide deposit return scheme that includes glass after attempts to introduce one in Scotland only descended into a debacle.\n\nIt is also expected to include measures to dramatically speed up the roll-out of heat pumps, with auditors warning only 5,000 were installed in 2022, far short of the Scottish Government's target of 25,000 per year.", "source": {"uri":

Seven in ten now say Scotland needs a fresh team of leaders.\n\nThe net beneficiaries of such sentiment look likely to be Labour. Whilst six in ten Scots have an unfavourable view of the Scottish Conservatives, 45% think Labour is ready for government in Westminster.\n\nThe Scottish public also told us this week they think a Labour-led Scottish government would do a better, rather than worse, job than an SNP-led government by a margin of 39% to 27%.\n\nMeanwhile, the independence question, the most important issue for Scots as recently as April 2021, now sits fifth on a list of priorities behind the NHS, cost of living, economy and education.\n\nThe SNP could yet be more resilient than expected\n\nThis all suggests Labour is likely to gain seats at the next general election in Scotland and may even compete to form a government in Holyrood in 2026.\n\nHowever, the party would be wise not to get ahead of itself. It is too early to know where public opinion will land on the SNP once a new leader is in place. It is possible they do well and get the party's house in order. Public opinion in Scotland has been volatile in recent years. You cannot be certain which way it goes next.\n\nThere is also no real polling consensus on Labour and the SNP's true level of support in a Westminster election either. Opinion polls since the start of the year have shown anything from a three-point Labour lead to a seven-point SNP one.\n\nAll of which puts the SNP in a much worse position than they were in 2019, but the breakdown of seats won by each party in Scotland is highly sensitive to small movements in the polls. The SNP could yet be more resilient than expected in terms of seats retained at the next general election.\n\nRegardless, any sense that the SNP is somehow going to fade away as a political force feels far-fetched. Polling for the Scottish parliament, for example, still consistently has them in first place on the constituency vote. Again, significantly down on the 2021 Scottish parliament election but still resilient and still a major force in Scottish politics. Especially when the next Scottish parliament election might not be until 2026.\n\nAnd the independence question is not going away\n\nIf the SNP are not going anywhere, neither is the question of Scottish independence - it cannot be assumed that falling salience today is permanent.\n\nIn the short term, the independence question offers a tactical challenge for Labour. A party seeking to gain votes from both the 'Yes' and 'No' side in a way the SNP and Conservatives are not. Perhaps this won't matter so much at the general election, if salience of the issue has fallen, but it is a challenge and one that could grow in future.\n\nMore importantly, Scots remain divided on the question of independence itself almost down the middle. Pollsters differ on the level of Yes support but polling this year has it anywhere between 47% and 53% once don't knows are removed.\n\nWith a majority of those aged under 50 in favour, even in the polls where Yes is weakest, the union cannot be considered secure, even if independence isn't the most important issue to Scots right now.\n\nA re-energised SNP could emerge if Labour doesn't deliver\n\nDespite these challenges, Labour's leaders in Scotland and Westminster have a big opportunity to capitalise on instability at the top of the SNP and SNP fatigue in Scotland more generally. Should Labour make it into Downing Street, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves will also have an opportunity to show Labour can deliver for Scotland and to show a divided country that the union is worth sticking with. Perhaps Anas Sarwar can even hope to become First Minister in Holyrood too.\n\nAnd yet it could all go so wrong. We know that the political inheritance Starmer and Reeves will likely take on in Westminster will be a very difficult one.\n\nIf a Labour government in Westminster is not seen as delivering for Scotland, a re-energised SNP could emerge under new leadership that threatens Labour once again in Westminster and puts independence back on the agenda at the 2026 Holyrood elections and beyond.\n\nWhilst not the most pressing question today, a decade from now we could find the union under threat if the question rises up the agenda again at a time when the 2014 referendum is 20 years old.\n\nRecently, Gordon Brown warned that \"in the long run, the forces pulling Britain apart are greater than the forces holding it together, unless something is done about it\". Unionists in Labour should consider their response carefully whilst they have the breathing space to do so.\n\nIf you have anything to share that we should be looking into or publishing about this or

I remember it well.\n\nThe strategy then is to take that (unlikely) mandate to the UK Government and begin negotiations on \"fresh action\", whatever that means, and to \"ask\" Westminster for more powers!\n\nREAD MORE: AI deepfake video of John Swinney on Sky News goes viral on Twitter\n\nAre Swinney and the SNP hierarchy naive, hopelessly optimistic, or just plain ignorant of certain obvious facts?\n\nFirstly, the chances of the SNP achieving a majority at the next UK election are disappearing at an increasing rate.\n\nSecondly even if, by some miracle, the SNP do manage to achieve a majority, the notion that any Westminster government, blue or red, will pay a blind bit of attention to any request from the Scottish Government for more powers is strictly for the birds.\n\nThe Unionists in Westminster may be arrogant, venal and vicious but they aren't stupid. They know that they simply can't afford to let the \"cash cow\" that is Scotland go. So they won't, no matter how much of a mandate we have. Humbly pleading for another referendum only makes us appear needy and pathetic. Please sir, may we have one, sir, please? Well the English-dominated Supreme Court slammed shut that door to independence and no amount of begging will open it. Forget it!\n\nREAD MORE: Labour and the Tories will forever be offering us less than the SNP\n\nSwinney also stated the importance of winning voters around to independence. \"We have to advance the arguments for independence,\" he says.\n\nSo, what's his strategy for doing that? Another dozen white papers that nobody reads? More \"progressive policies\" that the ordinary voter doesn't really give two hoots about? More marches that he himself doesn't attend?\n\nIt has been suggested that the only way forward now is to increase independence support to greater than 60% by an all-out forceful campaign, tell Westminster to get lost and put our case for recognition to the UN and the international community at large. Is that possible? Is it realistic? Are there no smart, legal minds in the SNP able to really investigate this as an alternative path? How about you, Joanna Cherry?\n\nREAD MORE: Kezia Dugdale: Labour may scrap free tuition fees in Scotland\n\nTo be blunt, I found reading John Swinney's speech profoundly depressing. Full of vague soundbites and empty of substance. If this is the best he can do then I despair.\n\nThe SNP has had my support and my vote in every single election since the 1960s but, for the first time in my life, I'm beginning to wonder if there's any point in continuing to do so!\n\nNOW that the dust is settling, I think there is room for some optimism. The numbers following the council elections in England would suggest that there is a real possibility of a hung Westminster parliament after the upcoming election.\n\nWe must ensure that the SNP are in a position to benefit from this by inviting those who want an independent Scotland to use their vote for SNP on the understanding that this will be regarded as a mandate for negotiation. I believe that this is a chance for our MPs to prove they are not corrupted by the system and that the British government will be forced to listen. The more MPs, the greater chance of success in such a strategy. Electoral pacts with Alba should be made.

It is also more essential and urgent than ever before.\n\nThat's because the UK economic model has failed - it's led to low and stagnant wages, low living standards, high inequality and an extraordinary and unstable concentration on London as the engine of UK economic growth.\n\nThe UK has now decided to leave the European Union, piling on more economic misery.\n\nBut it's not just Breixt, disastrous though that is for living standards, it is the fact that the Tories opted for a hard Brexit, taking the UK and Scotland out of the huge Single Market and Customs Union as well as the EU.\n\nThe lost economic output has wiped billions from the economy - and money that would have been available for public services such as the NHS.\n\nIncredibly Keir Starmer's Labour Party are committed to maintaining that hard Brexit. That means they are fully signed up to low economic growth and further hits to living standards. Rather than offering change they are locking Scotland into that failed economic model.\n\nIn the meantime when we look at comparable independent countries to Scotland, like Ireland and Denmark, we see they are both wealthier and fairer than the UK.\n\nSo with all our resources and talents: why not Scotland?\n\nGiven the damage of Westminster control we have a duty to offer the people of Scotland a compelling independence alternative. One that offers real hope and optimism and that demonstrates a sense of possibility.\n\nThis, then, is how we are going to achieve our independence: we must retain above all our faith in the democratic power of the people of Scotland.\n\nI am as impatient as anyone, but it is through respectful persuasion, evidence-building, and unfailing commitment and focus that we will achieve our goal.\n\nThe people of Scotland want to hear substance from us, not just process.\n\nAs a party that believes in the rule of law we can't ignore the decision of the UK Supreme Court. There are no shortcuts here.\n\nBut that must not mean we accept in any way Westminster's undemocratic blocking of the right of people to choose their own future.\n\nSo, trusting in the power of democracy, we will demonstrate good government at Holyrood. Using the limited powers of the Scottish Parliament wisely is a win-win for everyone in Scotland. It means we are delivering for people whatever their constitutional views and crucially showing the value of self-government.\n\nAnd because the Scottish Government believes independence offers the best future for Scotland, all Cabinet Secretaries and ministers - not just one - are responsible for helping to bring about that better future.\n\nAs a party we will use every electoral opportunity to advance the cause. The next such opportunity will be the forthcoming UK General Election. The SNP will go into that election on a manifesto which will say on page one, line one: \"Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.\"\n\nBetween now and then there is a crucial job for the SNP: to show the people of Scotland that winning independence is not separate from their top concerns. It is through independence that we can build a stronger economy, higher living standards and a better NHS.\n\nWe have achieved so much together: a Scottish Parliament and an independence referendum, both of which looked a long way off to me when I joined the SNP.\n\nThey were accomplished by always keeping our eye on the prize, building support, keeping up the pressure, and trusting in democratic power.

We're saying step up, double down on independence and send that message out.\"\n\nMr MacIntyre-Kemp said such a move would get grassroots independence supporters \"working in harmony\" with the SNP.\n\nGraeme McCormick, the former SNP leadership challenger who stood aside for John Swinney, said that it was \"right\" not to involve the civil service in any way.\n\nHe added: \"I envisage that this work will be taken forward with greater alacrity.\"\n\nA central part of Mr Hepburn's role was overseeing the publication of the government's Building a New Scotland papers - first launched by Nicola Sturgeon in June 2022 to make the case for independence.\n\nThe latest of the papers, on the justice system in an independent Scotland, was published on 25 April, the same day Mr Yousaf's power-sharing deal with the Scottish government collapsed.\n\nThe cabinet secretary for the constitution, Angus Robertson will retain oversight of the issue.\n\nThe Scottish government said this would

The next such opportunity will be the forthcoming UK General Election.\n\n\"The SNP will go into that election on a manifesto which will say on page one, line one: 'Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.' \"Between now and then there is a crucial job for the SNP: to show the people of Scotland that winning independence is not separate from their top concerns.\"\n\nThe creation of the minister for independence post was one of Humza Yousaf's key pledges during last year's SNP leadership contest.\n\nResponsibilities included \"independence strategy, parliamentary co-ordination and liaison regarding devolution, independence and Scotland's constitutional future, communication with people, businesses and organisations regarding devolution, independence and Scotland's constitutional future\".\n\nHowever, the position - which came with a \u00a332,000 salary uplift for the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth MSP - had proved controversial.\n\nOne of Mr Hepburn's main roles was in the production of the Building a New Scotland independence prospectus. The Scottish Government has confirmed that the publication of those papers will continue.\n\nNews that the ministerial portfolio had been ditched emerged late on Thursday night when the Scottish Government unveiled details of Mr Swinney's junior ministerial appointments.\n\nMr Swinney's full team now consists of 11 cabinet secretaries and 14 ministers, down from the 10 Cabinet Secretaries and 18 ministers in Humza Yousaf's administration.\n\nOther posts to be scrapped include the two held by the Scottish Greens and the Minister for Culture, Europe and International Development.\n\nKaukab Stewart who held the post is now Minister for Equalities.\n\nMr Swinney has also brought Ivan McKee back into government. He quit last year after Mr Yousaf offered him \"a smaller job\" than the he held under Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nThe Glasgow Provan MSP - who was briefly Kate Forbes's campaign manager during 2023's SNP leadership contest - will be Public Finance Minister.\n\nThat post was previously held by Tom Arthur. He has been moved to work under Ms Forbes as the Minister for Employment and Investment.\n\nWhile there has been little movement at the top level of government, with Mr Swinney keeping all of Mr Yousaf's Cabinet Secretaries in place, there have been casualties among the junior ranks.\n\nEmma Roddick, who was minister for equalities, migration and refugees, Joe Fitzpatrick, who had been minister for local government empowerment and planning, and George Adam, who was previously minister for parliamentary business, have all \"stepped down from their previous roles.\"\n\nChris McEleny, Alba's general secretary said: \"Humza Yousaf created the role of Minister for independence so that it looked like his Government was taking action on independence.\n\n\"We are currently at a constitutional logjam. John Swinney has said his independence strategy is the same as Humza Yousaf's - a strategy that the SNP's longest serving MP Peter Wishart labelled 'a total mess'.\n\n\"The new SNP Government has made the decision to deprioritise independence in order to try broaden support for itself within parliament.\n\n\"Instead of appealing to unionists, the First Minister should be reaching out to Alba Party's Holyrood leader Ash Regan MSP to turbo charge efforts to drive forward the case for independence.\"\n\nThe decision was welcomed by the Lib Dems.\n\nWillie Rennie said: \"For months I have been campaigning to free the Cumbernauld One from the drudgery of producing independence paper after independence paper that no one reads.\n\n\"I am delighted to say that goal has now been achieved.\n\n\"The Scottish Government needs to have a laser focus on the issues that really matter, like tackling long waits for healthcare and violence in our schools.\"", "source": {"uri":

At the next Westminster election, if people vote SNP they are voting for Scotland to be an independent country; clear, simple, democratic\".\n\nOn that basis when the SNP is rejected so too will be any hopes of independence for the foreseeable future.\n\nMore dignified solution than begging would make Dundee less hostile\n\nDundee isn't unique in the problems faced by its city centre.\n\nThe Courier survey has offered a wide range of views on how to tackle many of the issues.\n\nOne of the problems in town is street begging, something which sharply divides public opinion.\n\nI conducted a social media poll which showed an almost even split between those who give sometimes and those who don't give at all.\n\nMany who beg on the streets live chaotic lifestyles, can't cope with normal life, and use the money for drugs, although there are undoubtedly some for whom it's purely a money-making exercise.\n\nMost are passive although some are increasingly aggressive; recently I spoke to one young girl after mass who had been slashed by a fellow beggar.\n\nI wonder if it would be better to stop street begging and instead have donation boxes in public spaces around the city where those wishing to offer money could contribute.\n\nIt can't be impossible to devise a method of disbursing money at set locations for those who'd otherwise be sitting for hours looking for financial help.\n\nIt would be more dignified and less demeaning and might also make the city centre a less hostile place for everyone.", "source": {"uri": "thecourier.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

It is also more essential and urgent than ever before.\n\nThat's because the UK economic model has failed - it's led to low and stagnant wages, low living standards, high inequality and an extraordinary and unstable concentration on London as the engine of UK economic growth.\n\nThe UK has now decided to leave the European Union, piling on more economic misery.\n\nREAD MORE: MEP candidates urged to declare official support for Scotland joining EU\n\nBut it's not just Brexit, disastrous though that is for living standards, it is the fact that the Tories opted for a hard Brexit, taking the UK and Scotland out of the huge Single Market and Customs Union as well as the EU.\n\nThe lost economic output has wiped billions from the economy - and money that would have been available for public services such as the NHS.\n\nIncredibly Keir Starmer's Labour Party are committed to maintaining that hard Brexit. That means they are fully signed up to low economic growth and further hits to living standards. Rather than offering change they are locking Scotland into that failed economic model.\n\nLabour are hard-core Brexiteers and a hard-core anti-independence party.\n\nKeir Starmer with Brexiteer MP and Tory defector Natalie Elphicke\n\nIn the meantime when we look at comparable independent countries to Scotland, like Ireland and Denmark, we see they are both wealthier and fairer than the UK.\n\nSo with all our resources and talents: why not Scotland?\n\nGiven the damage of Westminster control we have a duty to offer the people of Scotland a compelling independence alternative. One that offers real hope and optimism and that demonstrates a sense of possibility.\n\nThis, then, is how we are going to achieve our independence: we must retain above all our faith in the democratic power of the people of Scotland.\n\nI am as impatient as anyone, but it is through respectful persuasion, evidence-building, and unfailing commitment and focus that we will achieve our goal.\n\nThe people of Scotland want to hear substance from us, not just process.\n\nAs a party that believes in the rule of law we can't ignore the decision of the UK Supreme Court. There are no short-cuts here.\n\nBut that must not mean we accept in any way Westminster's undemocratic blocking of the right of people to choose their own future.\n\nSo, trusting in the power of democracy, we will demonstrate good government at Holyrood. Using the limited powers of the Scottish Parliament wisely is a win-win for everyone in Scotland. It means we are delivering for people whatever their constitutional views and crucially showing the value of self-government.\n\nAnd because the Scottish Government believes independence offers the best future for Scotland, all Cabinet Secretaries and ministers - not just one - are responsible for helping to bring about that better future.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney drops minister for independence role in new ministerial team\n\nAs a party we will use every electoral opportunity to advance the cause. The next such opportunity will be the forthcoming UK General Election. The SNP will go into that election on a manifesto which will say on page one, line one: \"Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.\"\n\nBetween now and then there is a crucial job for the SNP: to show the people of Scotland that winning independence is not separate from their top concerns. It is through independence that we can build a stronger economy, higher living standards and a better NHS.\n\nWe have achieved so much together: a Scottish Parliament and an independence referendum, both of which looked a long way off to me when I joined the SNP.\n\nThey were accomplished by always keeping our eye on the prize, building support, keeping up the pressure, and trusting in democratic power. That's how we are going to win our country's independence.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was brought to mind as John Swinney announced his cabinet and Keir Starmer welcomed his new recruit Natalie Elphicke, saying: \"I'm delighted to welcome Natalie Elphicke to the Labour party... She's on the front line when it comes to the crisis on small boats.\"\n\nLabour and the SNP can be seen as mirror-parties in the Mirror World of British politics subject to many of the same forces at play, as we descend the final months of fourteen years of Conservative government, as Rishi Sunak's party staggers towards political oblivion.\n\nWhile Starmer has been on the receiving end of derision and contempt for his decision to accept Elphicke into the arms of his new Labour project (Natalie Elphicke is a hard-right Tory. Her defection sums up Labour's contempt for progressive voters), John Swinney will be expecting plaudits for the appointment of Kate Forbes into the role of Deputy Leader of the SNP. But he shouldn't expect the long queue of commentators to start penning his praise very soon.\n\nAs John Swinney ascends the thrown of First Minister promising be a \"first minister for everyone in Scotland\" he appoints a figure who is deeply divisive and reactionary. Consider how this response, to a very simple question sounds like its speaking to a \"Scotland for everyone\" agenda?\n\nSwinney's new cabinet is, at best, uninspiring and at worst, desultory. His attempt at talking the language of 'healing, respect and reconciliation' (variously) is undermined by the fact that these things only have meaning if they are rooted in an actual process of reality. But the efforts to buy-off contenders and slot Swinney into post - thereby avoiding the tortuous leadership contest of yesteryear that left blood in the water - does not speak to a party aiming to or able to engage in genuine reconciliation. The same powers that hated the Greens with a passion still exist, the same powers that couldn't abide ANY political divergence within the Union still exists, the same tensions within civil society as well as political parties still exist, and the same Overton Window that talks of 'competent government' (code for neoliberal economics) still exists. Planting Kate Forbes in a powerful position doesn't assuage those forces or make those issues go away, it just makes it clear that you are beholden to them.\n\nIt may well be that the Swinney anointment is good for the SNP. As Dani Garavelli has written Swinney \"... is the man best placed to restore stability. He is the man most likely to minimise the damage inflicted by Scottish Labour and to steer the party towards the Holyrood elections in 2026.\"\n\nBut, as everyone has noted long ago, the fate of the SNP and the future of the independence cause are not one and the same, in fact, the very qualities that John Swinney brings to play: safety, security, stability and moderation are fine ones, they're just not the qualities that you need to bring about independence. Scottish independence, by definition is a rupture, it is breaking with the British state and creating a new one. Imagining that you do that by changing nothing at all is a perverse fantasy, not a political strategy.\n\nIn coronating Swinney the SNP have exposed and confirmed what we already new, that the party is deeply committed to a soft-centralism, and has no real intention of confronting structural power either in Scotland or in wider Britain. In this respect, while they performatively play-out the games of opposition and slinging doges abuse at each other, the SNP and Labour are at one. There is a veneer or policy difference, but both are subject to the pressures of what is politically acceptable. That window is slightly wider, or positioned slightly to the left in Scotland, but not by much.\n\nIf Swinney's 'safe pair of hand's' offers security for his party, it may offer sterility for the wider independence movement. How far away is it from the vision conjured by Neal Ascherson this week when he wrote of an alternate strategy he calls 'As If'. In it he imagines a (far) more radical Scottish leadership:\n\n\"As if\" means acting as if Scotland were already independent. It means marching ahead with legislation officially reserved to Westminster under the Scotland Acts and daring the UK government to intervene. The second strategy would mean simply refusing to execute UK laws or orders that Holyrood thought morally or practically wrong for Scotland. Examples: refusing police protection for Home Office snatch vans driving from England to seize asylum seekers for deportation (see previous crowd actions in Glasgow and Edinburgh to block the vans and free their prisoners).\n\nAnother: to refuse to apply anti-trade union measures from the UK government, such as the strike-breaking Minimum Service Levels Act. Both these are already popular causes. Flat-out and sustained confrontation with the UK government over such laws could end in sanctions against Holyrood or even the suspension of the Scottish parliament; a provoked crisis, but one that could shift Scottish opinion irrevocably towards ending the union. However, there's not the slightest sign in the SNP of the fearlessness such \"illegal'' behaviour would require. So the wish for independence will survive, even though the vehicle to carry it sits on the hard shoulder with flat tyres.\"\n\nTo see just wow far away we are from this vision today its worth noting that the following words and concepts are no longer in Scottish Government titles (hat-tip to Dr Hannah Graham): 'Migration & Refugees', 'Europe and International Development', 'Planning', 'Fair Work', 'Community Wealth', 'Just Transition', 'Biodiversity', 'NHS Recovery', 'Active Travel', 'Innovation and Trade', 'Independence'.\n\nAs well as these words being removed from the frontline (not that many of them were ever really on the frontline) the post of Minister for Independence has been removed (it was held by Jamie Hepburn in case for some reason you hadn't been aware of the full impact of his role).\n\nAs the commentator Jonathon Shafi has noted: \"Scrapping the Minister for Independence role comes alongside a generally defensive approach. The SNP know the \"yes movement\" doesn't exist as a social force in the same way and indy has reduced in electoral salience. So back to \"competent managers\" of economy within devolved context.\"\n\nIn fact, a period of honest from the SNP in which they said \"conditions have changed, we have no real route to independence\" might be a good thing. A root and branch look at the prospectus for independence, an authentic look at the problems and issues at play and a historic (and long overdue) reflection on past failures would be the right things to do. That way the case could be rebuilt from the ground up and a re-boot with a basis grounded in 2024 could be conceived. Instead we can all see the reverting to type, the disjuncture between act and deed, and the fundamental dishonesty at play.\n\nThere's a dark irony here. Despite the SNP's failing, mismanagement and ability to conjure mass ennui, support for independence remains stubbornly at 50%, a sort of thrawn gesture of gallus defiance to the world. This is perhaps because, despite the failure of the political class, the Union itself lies in tatters: every single argument pushed out in 2014 is now an absurdist joke; the experience of living under the May, Johnson, Truss and Sunak regimes has confirmed every argument for self-determination. But most of all, as Ascherson concludes: \"There's a democratic problem, too. Ironically, by introducing democracy into the antique 1707 union, devolution showed why it no longer works. \"Partnership\" in a democratised union where 85% of the citizens belong to one member, England, can only be a fiction.\"\n\nAs John Swinney rightly attempts to inject some much-needed civility into public discourse, the fact remains that such is the contempt with which Scotland, and Scottish representatives are held that the crisis of the SNP is used as a proxy for the whole nation being in disarray and open to dogs abuse. As Neil Mackay points out this isn't symmetrical or part of a lively critical culture. He writes: \"Sturgeon is subjected to staggering levels of hate and misogyny online, as are nearly all women politicians. However, with Sturgeon we never hear many complaints from the opposing camp. Her looks, her dress-sense - even the miscarriage she experienced - are all fair game for those from the fevered fringes of the right and unionism.\"\n\n\"Would they be so quiescent if this was a woman from a political party they voted for? Humza Yousaf also endures intolerable attacks, specifically around race and religion. Again, almost universal silence from the right and the hard wing of unionism. Patrick Harvie of the Greens is targeted for grotesque homophobic abuse, with insults such as \"groomer\" thrown at him. There's been disgraceful dog-whistles directed at Harvie by those with a public platform. Would this be tolerated for a Labour or Conservative figure?\"\n\n\"The well-known comedian Janey Godley, seen as pro-independence and a supporter of progressive causes, suffers such appalling abuse online that it's sometimes difficult to read. She has cancer, yet those who hate her hound Godley with undisguised sadistic glee.\"\n\nSo what?\n\nWell if doors look closed and roots to independence look shut down, the defenders of the Union are reduced to abuse. If we are 'UnBrit's' so be it. I'll take it thanks. Others are triumphant at what they see as a great reset, the world returned to as they were pre 2014. Still hankering for a Kate Forbes leadership, and published just before Swinney's coronation the New Statesman wrote an editorial: \"A leader such as Ms Forbes would deliver the hard truths the SNP needs to hear; wealth creation as well as wealth redistribution matters; public services require reform rather than simply more resources; and unreflective progressivism alienates Scotland's moderate majority.\"\n\nSuch political themes - wealth creation - 'public service reform' - and reference to a silent majority are direct echoes of Thatcher and strange to be voiced in a journal previously proudly of the Left. But Scotland has long been seen a sort of recalcitrant child, misbehaving for not following the line given from London.\n\nThe crisis of the SNP is a profound one unlikely to be papered over by parashooting in a new leader, but it is reflective of a wider and deeper crisis in British politics such that triumphalism at their state of play is unfounded as we stare into the mirror at the prospect of a Starmer government.", "source": {"uri": "bellacaledonia.org.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bella Caledonia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I know that Humza will continue to make a substantial contribution to the public life of Scotland and I thank him for all that he has done as our Party Leader and First Minister.\n\nToday is the beginning of a new chapter in our party's history - a chapter that will be about coming together, uniting and dedicating ourselves to the service of Scotland.\n\nI want to express my heartfelt thanks to the many Party members, and the many Elected Members, at Westminster and Holyrood, and in our Councils, for their encouragement to me to stand for the Party leadership.\n\nMy decision to stand is not borne out of long-held ambition, but rather a profound sense of duty to my Party and my country.\n\nI know there is controversy for some that I am the only candidate to stand for the leadership. Perhaps not surprisingly I take a different view. For me, the fact that I am the only candidate demonstrates the Scottish National Party is now coming back together again.\n\nI promised I would create an inclusive and unified team. And I will do that.\n\nI promised I would enable open and respectful dialogue in the SNP. And I will do that.\n\nI promised to make sure the SNP looks outward to the people of our country and not inward amongst ourselves. And I will do that.\n\nI have had the privilege of contributing a significant amount to the SNP story.\n\nIn that time, I have seen the lows and the highs of our modern political history as a Party. And, over those highs and lows, one thing has been clear time after time:\n\nScotland wins when the SNP wins.\n\nYes, we have faced a rough time recently as a Party. But remember what has been happening during that rough time.\n\nThe Scottish child payment is lifting 100,000 children out of poverty.\n\nFree University tuition opens a better future to record numbers of young people from poorer backgrounds.\n\nAnd, the massive expansion of child care is giving children from every background a better start in life.\n\nSo however tough it has been recently for the SNP, never ever forget that at the same time, SNP policies and actions are transforming lives here and now in our country.\n\nAs I begin my leadership of the party I love, I want to speak not just to everyone here at this SNP gathering.\n\nI want to speak to each and every person in this country.\n\nTo those who know me and those who don't.\n\nTo those who support the SNP and those who never have.\n\nAnd, to those who support independence and those we are yet to convince.\n\nI want to set out the vision I have of our nation's future.\n\nI said when I launched my candidacy for leadership that I wanted to create a modern, diverse, dynamic Scotland.\n\nToday I am standing in a building that speaks of that future.\n\nIt is the Advanced Research Centre of the University of Glasgow.\n\nHere in the heart of one of the oldest universities in Europe, research into the newest, leading edge technologies push back the boundaries of what is possible.\n\nExperience and innovation combined.\n\nHistory and modernity together, forging a new future.\n\nThat is the perfect vision for Scotland.\n\nA country with a depth of history, can blend the old and the new and forge the best future for herself.\n\nA country where people have good jobs, the climate is protected, the vulnerable are lifted up and opportunity is available to all.\n\nThat is the new chapter I offer.\n\nOne built on experience.\n\nOn skills honed over decades.\n\nEvery moment of my journey devoted to building the new Scotland I believe is possible.\n\nLater this week, Scotland will choose a new First Minister.\n\nIn putting my name forward, it is important that I set out what kind of First Minister I will be.\n\nI spoke last week about unifying our party and about what we can do for Scotland together.\n\nI believe the same is true of our Parliament.\n\nIn 2021, the share of the vote commanded by Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all fell.\n\nThe SNP recorded our best ever share of the constituency vote.\n\nIn fact, we won more votes and a higher share of the votes in the constituency ballot than any party in the 25 year history of devolution.\n\nThat is our mandate but it does not give us a monopoly on good ideas.\n\nIt means that we have the right - in fact, the duty - to form the government. But it does not mean we can stop listening to people and voices outside our party.\n\nThe polarisation of politics does not serve our country well.\n\nToo often, too many people are too busy fighting to win battles when we should be seeking solutions to problems.\n\nThat is what I pledge I will seek to do.\n\nI will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well.\n\nThat does not mean debate will end - far from it - but it does mean that, should I be elected, I will first seek to find common ground, to join together in coalitions of the willing and solve the problems our country faces.\n\nWe need to stop shouting at each other and talk.\n\nMore than that, actually, we need to listen.\n\nAnd as First Minister, I will do exactly that.\n\nAnd Friends, I believe recent events show that this approach works.\n\nLast week I met with Kate Forbes. We came together and discussed the shared ambitions we have for our country and how best to go forward. I welcome Kate's support for my leadership.\n\nAnd over the weekend, I reached out to my party colleague Graeme McCormick.\n\nHe wanted to stand for election so he could be heard. So I listened and assured him the views of party members up and down the country will be properly listened to.\n\nThe simple lesson is that dialogue can bring us to points of agreement and strength.\n\nAnd that is my message today to every party in the Scottish Parliament. Focus on solutions to problems and you will find no one more willing to listen than me.\n\nTogether we can make a real difference to the lives of people in Scotland. That is the job we have all been sent to Parliament to do.\n\nOf course, I believe that this country could do more if we had the powers of a normal independent nation - the powers of independence. The cost of living crisis and the damaging impact of Brexit are two examples of Westminster decisions that are bad for Scotland. They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have Independence to make our own decisions and create our best future.\n\nI will always seek, with respect and courtesy, to persuade people of the case for Independence.\n\nAll I ask of those who oppose that vision is they also act with the same courtesy and respect.\n\nThat means Independence is not a reason for them to refuse to work with us to build the economy, support jobs and improve the health service.\n\nIf elected First Minister, my focus will be the economy, jobs, the cost of living. It will be the NHS, our schools and our public services. It will be addressing the climate crisis.\n\nSo to everyone in every party, to every MSP, to every MP. In fact, to everyone in our great country, I say this:\n\nJoin me.\n\nDo not let our disagreements dominate.\n\nJoin me as we open a new chapter.\n\nAs we create a vibrant economy in every part of our country.\n\nAs we tackle the challenges faced by the NHS.\n\nAs we build on the strengths of our schools.\n\nAs we build more homes.\n\nTake climate action.\n\nImprove public transport.\n\nAnd create jobs.\n\nThat's my job, that's our job.\n\nAnd I plan to get the job done.\n\nThank you\n\nJohn Swinney", "source": {"uri": "scotsindependent.scot", "dataType": "news", "title":

The SNP forming a minority government. A new First Minister. And now, the latest development in a long list of shake-ups - the role of independence minister has been scrapped.\n\nThe role - previously held by Jamie Hepburn - was tasked with advancing the case for Scottish independence across government departments.\n\nREAD MORE: Believe in Scotland to team up with Yes group for campaign day in Moffat\n\nHowever when the new ministerial team was introduced on Wednesday, the role had been axed, with Swinney arguing in The National that the role's responsibilities now fall on \"all Cabinet Secretaries and ministers\".\n\nWe spoke to grassroots activists to gather their reaction to there no longer being a minister for independence.\n\nHow close does independence feel now? What does this decision say about Swinney's priorities?\n\nThere's perhaps not as much outrage as you'd expect. In fact, some activists we spoke to didn't see much point in the role in the first place.\n\nInstead, some are suggesting that this is a time to reflect on the progress we're making with independence, and to remember that growing public support for independence starts at the grassroots level.\n\nHere's what people had to say.\n\nGordon MacIntyre-Kemp, founder of Believe in Scotland, called on the new First Minister to personally take on the portfolio of independence minister, and for the continuation of cross-party collaboration on progressing independence.\n\n\"We call on John Swinney to state officially that he personally is now the minister for independence going forward. Furthermore, we believe that every government minister and SNP spokespeople should be briefed to make the case for independence at every opportunity and with more consistency than the SNP have managed since 2014,\" he (below) said.\n\nHe added that the SNP should \"go all out for independence\" at a time when support for independence is high, but support for the SNP is \"languishing\".\n\n\"Believe in Scotland expects the SNP to maintain its focus on independence as the way to end the damage caused to Scotland's economy by Brexit by rejoining the EU,\" MacIntyre-Kemp continued.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney: Shortcuts and impatience will not win independence\n\n\"To end the cost of living crisis and leave the neoliberalism/austerity led economic approach, shared by all the London based parties, in the dustbin of failed economic approaches where it belongs and most importantly, invest in the wellbeing of Scotland's people.\"\n\nMacIntyre-Kemp added that he had worked \"very closely\" with both Swinney and Kate Forbes, the new Deputy First Minister, and said he was looking forward to finding out what their plans were for progressing support for independence.\n\n\"I think it makes sense the minister for indy role being scrapped. We need to work on building support for indy and I believe the best way to do that is through grassroots activism and good government. This move keeps the two separate and is no bad thing.\n\n\"I think indy feels closer than in 2014. However, not as close as we'd want or hope. The world is a very different place at the moment with challenges left right and centre. Indy is not at the forefront of folks' minds and we need to be honest about this, address the challenges through competent government and show people why indy is necessary.\n\n\"John's leadership slogan was uniting for independence. He's been a member all his adult life and believes in indy with every fibre of his being. I think dropping the role was an olive branch for cross party working and bringing people together. It does not mean he does not care about independence.\" - Logan Unwin, SNP activist\n\n\"Will it make any difference? Will anyone notice?\" - Ian McLean, via Twitter\n\n\"Creating the post of independence minister was a performative gesture. I don't recall Jamie Hepburn coming up with new strategies for getting past the UK Govt's ban on referendums. When he met with pro-indy grassroots groups he came across as passive.\n\n\"The post itself was meant to indicate to frustrated indy supporters that the Scottish Government was serious about pursuing indy. Similarly, the abolition of the post is to indicate to soft No voters that the Scottish Government won't prioritise independence over bread-and-butter issues.\n\n\"Whatever the SNP do, non-party affiliated groups like Pensioners for Independence will carry on fighting for the right to choose our own sovereign governments and keep our own taxes in Scotland.\" - Mary McCabe, Pensioners for Independence\n\nREAD MORE: MSP lodges Holyrood motion to recognise The National's arms exports series\n\n\"Independence is a long way away, and that's okay. To (successfully) win independence without dividing the country (like Brexit did) you need more than ~50% of the country to support it. You need devolution levels of support they saw in the 1997 referendum to take the whole country with you.\n\n\"The easiest way to get that? Is for the SNP to govern well. They need to demonstrate that they are capable of 'grown up' politics. That's how they achieved such a high vote share in 2011/2016/2021 and that's what they're lacking now. Scrapping the minister for independence role shows they are taking their responsibilities as the governing party of the country seriously and, in my humble opinion, should be commended.\n\n\"I recognise the merits of independence but do not think it's right to push for it at a time which will cause division and likely put us in a similar position that Brexit has (not just economically but also socially)!\" - Stewart Duncan\n\n\"It's a good move because it removes a stick that the media and opposition used to beat the Scottish govt with. Anyway, every minister and cab sec should be a strong advocate of independence so it shouldn't make any difference.\" - Dick Winchester, via Twitter", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType":

This is an admission that we live in a two-party system, and that while other parties, policies, and ideologies exist, it is only theirs that matter.\n\nREAD MORE: AI deepfake video of John Swinney on Sky News goes viral on Twitter\n\nThe most worrying part is that there was never any challenge from interviewers about this, but that's because - by virtue of the first-past-the-post voting system - they are basically right, it's just that they're saying the quiet part out loud: in England, you're voting for the party of Margaret Thatcher or the party with a leader who looks up to Margaret Thatcher; the party that introduced the two-child cap or the party that intends to keep the two-child cap; the party that took us out of the EU or the party that plans to keep us out of the EU ... you get the idea!\n\nIn Scotland, however, we have a third option. We know that regardless of how we vote, the now 543 English seats, of a total 650, will likely determine the next government and prime minister, so it's worth remembering that the SNP in Westminster has often acted as the parliament's conscience, and while the \"Official Opposition\" is meant to hold government to account, the SNP have held both government and opposition to account, and the SNP have constantly reminded the Labour Party of the values it once had, whilst also holding a mirror up to the naked fascism in the words and actions of the party opposite.\n\nUltimately, a vote for the SNP at the General Election is a vote to reject the idea that we must accept what either the Tories or Labour are offering us, because for as long as they - and the Liberal Democrats - continue to stand arm in arm, better together, under the red, white and blue banner of \"Unionism\", they will forever be offering us less than the SNP, with the prize of independence and all the powers that come with it, including democracy itself.\n\nJim Love\n\nIslay\n\nI ENJOYED reading Laura Webster's piece about Patrick Harvie (Back to the basics, May 5), but I was disturbed by the idea that those of us who voted SNP 1/Greens 2 would be put off doing so again by the ending of the Bute House Agreement.\n\nHarvie's patient explanation was well reported. Targets were set but not met, and not enough effort was put into saving the planet. Never was a truer word uttered, but it behoves anyone with progeny to move forward with some grit to try and save our precious and irreplaceable living space.\n\nREAD MORE: I made the Greens pro-independence - here's the truth about their approach to Yes\n\nI can easily understand why voting for the SNP in a Westminster General Election might hasten the demise of the Tories, but why not support the Greens when we are next allowed to vote for the Holyrood parliament? I find it unbelievable that, following Humza Yousaf's fatal mistake, any supporter of the SNP and Scottish independence would desist from voting for biodiversity and the survival of the human race.\n\nWould Labour be a better alternative? Surely not. What would be the point? They clearly aren't interested in either independence or our future.\n\nTony Kime\n\nKelso\n\nI WAS deeply impressed by Naomi Klein's address at the Seder in the Streets in New York, which was printed in The Guardian newspaper on April 24. She spoke of Zionism as a false idol, such as Jewish people are commanded to spurn.\n\nIn rabbinic tradition, as I understand it, the coming of the Messiah is supposed to herald the gathering of the chosen people in the promised land once again, and the rebuilding of the temple. The religious Zionist extremists seem to want to usurp this function, presumably thinking that if they gather the Jewish people and build their temple, destroying Al-Aqsa mosque in the process, they will force the Messiah's hand? I can only understand this as blasphemous. It's supposed to be God's work.\n\nREAD MORE: One-year-old killed by 'single gunshot to head' in Gaza\n\nRemember that Al-Aqsa is the third holiest site in Islam. Its destruction would surely ignite an explosion across the Muslim world, from Morocco to Indonesia. Israel's \"security\" minister, the hideous Ben-Gvir, has been repeatedly trying to incite trouble over the mosque, to such an extent that even in Netanyahu's extremist government, I believe he has now been relieved of responsibility for the site.\n\nFinally, there is a quote I came across a good number of years ago, attributed to an American priest, who I think aimed it at the Christian right, but it seems apt in this context: \"You can safely assume you've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot",

One decision which immediately attracted controversy was the axing of the post of minister for independence which was created by his predecessor Humza Yousaf.\n\nThe decision was greeted with predictable criticism from certain conspiracy theorist quarters who saw it as 'proof' that the Scottish Government and the SNP are not really interested in pursuing independence.\n\nIn the new slimmed-down cabinet, the minister for planning role was also dropped, as were specific briefs on the just transition, Europe and international development, and biodiversity.\n\nThere is an element of magical thinking amongst some in the wider Scottish independence movement who appear to believe that the SNP merely needs to engineer a massive constitutional confrontation with Westminster and Scotland would immediately shake free from the shackles of Westminster rule.\n\nSadly, that is not the case.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney addresses ending minister for independence role\n\nThe reality is that Scotland remains a nation in which there is no broad consensus on independence and the overriding priority of the independence movement and the pro-independence parties must be to build that wider consensus in Scottish society.\n\nIn an article for The National, the new first minister argued that competent government and \"respectful persuasion\" were the tools with which a pro-independence consensus could slowly be built across Scots society.\n\nThere is, however, an obvious problem with this formula.\n\nThe catastrophising and hysterical anti-independence media in Scotland obsessively focuses on the perceived failures of the Scottish Government but glosses over its successes.\n\nJohn Swinney with his Cabinet Ministers\n\nA recent example of this was the achievement of Yousaf in ensuring that Scotland was the only part of the UK where NHS strikes were avoided.\n\nYet BBC Scotland, which had clearly been gearing itself up for days of extensive Scottish Government-blaming coverage should the strikes have taken place, shamefully trotted through the then-first minister's success in less than 20 seconds.\n\nThis was not an isolated incident.\n\nIt's a regular occurrence in anti-independence media which routinely fails to place the challenges facing the Scottish Government into a wider UK context of its dependency on funding from Westminster and its lack of the full range of powers of an independent nation.\n\nIt's a media that acts as though the Scottish Government already had complete freedom of movement even as it relentlessly campaigns to prevent that ever coming to pass.\n\nI've said it before, but it bears repeating, the current devolution settlement in many respects acts as mechanism for devolving the blame for Westminster funding decisions to Holyrood.\n\nThis is a serious problem in a nation like Scotland where the disposition of the media is wildly unrepresentative of the range of views within the country on the constitutional issue which is the fulcrum of Scottish politics.\n\nThe Scottish media is overwhelmingly hostile to the idea of independence and that ensures that any pro-independence political party will struggle to build a reputation for competence in government.\n\nSwinney argues that there is no need in his new cabinet for a dedicated minister for independence as building the case for independence is a central part of the role of all ministers in his government.\n\nThat may well be true and as such is welcome and reassuring.\n\nIn his article for The National the First Minister wrote: \"Because the Scottish Government believes independence offers the best future for Scotland, all Cabinet Secretaries and ministers - not just one - are responsible for helping to bring about that better future.\"\n\nHowever, the optics of abolishing the post of a dedicated minister for independence are problematic at a time when the overriding need of the new first minister is to inspire confidence in the wider independence movement.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney announces new ministerial team - see the full list\n\nHis government remains committed to the furtherance of the case for independence at a time when it's difficult to see a clear path ahead due to the undemocratic behaviour of the Labour and Conservative parties.\n\nThe new first minister cannot risk allowing independence to be seen as an afterthought for his government, something which they'd gratefully accept if it fell magically into its lap.\n\nA pro-independence Scottish Government must be the spearhead of the wider grassroots independence movement which it must both lead and inspire.\n\nThe Labour backlash against Keir Starmer for his decision to admit a hard-right Tory MP into his party is continuing to gain strength.\n\nNatalie Elphicke, the erstwhile Conservative MP for Dover, crossed the floor of the House of Commons on Wednesday and now sits as a Labour MP.\n\nThe decision sparked anger amongst many in the Labour party given that Elphicke was considered hard right even by the standards of a Conservative party which has moved very far to the right in recent years.\n\nKeir Starmer welcomed Natalie Elphicke after defecting from the Tories\n\nElphicke was as staunch member of the hard right anti-EU European Research Group and was outspoken in her opposition to immigration and her support for the Rwanda policy and frequently spoke of her belief that even tougher measures should be taken against refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nYet Elphicke now sits as a Labour MP even as Diane Abbott has remained suspended from the Labour party for the best part of a year.\n\nLabour chair Anneliese Dodds is the latest senior Labour figure to sell their soul and has defended the decision to grant Elphicke's asylum application.\n\nDodds said she believed Elphicke was a good fit for Labour because her remarks on border security and housing were \"absolutely fundamental to the Labour party\".\n\nThey should have sent Elphicke to the Bibby Stockholm for months to await their decision.\n\nIt's not just Elphicke's hard right views on Europe and immigration that have sparked disquiet in the Labour party.\n\nThe decision to admit her has been controversial among many female Labour MPs because of Elphicke's defence of her former husband, the Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, who was convicted of sexual assault in 2020 and sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nShortly after his conviction, Elphicke told the Sun her husband had been the victim of a \"terrible miscarriage of justice\", and she cast doubt on his victims' testimonies.\n\nREAD MORE: Natalie Elphicke apologises for comments about ex-husband's victims\n\nShe said at the time: \"Charlie is charming, wealthy, charismatic and successful - attractive, and attracted to, women.\n\n\"All things that in today's climate made him an easy target for dirty politics and false allegations.\"\n\nElphicke, along with four other Tory MPs, was later sanctioned by the House of Commons Standards Committee for trying to influence the judge's ruling on her husband's appeal against his sentence and conviction.\n\nThe appeal failed and the Elphicke's divorced.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Scared he wouldn't quite get the votes and lose control of the already failing narrative of the SNP or just because he couldn't be bothered to actually have a contest?\n\nYou see what is becoming clearer and clearer to me - and most Scots - is that when push comes to shove the SNP just can't be bothered.\n\nThey couldn't be bothered to have a grown-up chat with their Green colleagues a fortnight ago and tell them of their stance that was making the Bute House agreement unworkable - instead, they just dumped them like you would an old bit of chewing gum at the bottom of your bag - unceremoniously, without thought and absolutely devoid of any feeling.\n\nWhich has brought all of this on.\n\nThey couldn't be bothered to have a leadership contest - is that because examining the reality of what Swinney has done in his previous roles? I'll give you one as a starter here - this was the man who was in charge of the SQA fiasco during Covid, which resulted in anguish, hurt and missed opportunities for thousands of our young people as well as a review of a then-world class system.\n\nOr is it simply that those who STILL hold the power cards within the SNP simply couldn't let someone with the sort of views that Kate Forbes has potentially lead the party - easier to deny the party members their democratic right to vote on a new leader.\n\nIn all honestly, as much as all of this vexes me - and it does - the real denying of democracy that frustrates me is the lack of a Scottish election.\n\nAvid readers of my column will know it's not unusual for me to say we need change or we need a general election now. But come on. We now need a Scottish election as well.\n\nTwo unelected leaders, two incompetent men who have been thrust upon Scotland to lead them - one not even with the express wishes of his own party! And we are supposed to just take it.\n\nWhat's even more baffling is the fact the SNP never stop mentioning the fact the Tories are at this carry-on in London. Imposing hopeless haddies on us as PM one after the other (I do agree with them on this) without calling a general election and listening to the will of the people.\n\nAnd why? Because both the SNP and the Conservatives are running scared - any soundbite of late - last week's elections in England gave us a bit of taste - indicates the Tories are toast.\n\nSo now, with our second unelected First Minister named and our second unelected Prime Minister still hanging on ...

I was 16 when I was first introduced to the concept and a passion - coupled with an insatiable autistic distaste for injustice - was ignited.\n\nI have spent those years campaigning fiercely for the principles that I hold dear. Equality, fairness, progression. I believe in those values to my core, and they underpin the very fibre of my being.\n\nI have taken some personal hits for being so fiercely protective of them - my personal safety and mental peace at the hands of online abuse being the biggest sacrifice of all.\n\nREAD MORE: Swinney cannot afford to treat independence as an afterthought\n\nBut, even if sometimes it feels tempting to capitulate when you are in the throes of 300-plus responses to a fairly innocuous tweet, I am physically incapable of doing so.\n\nThat's the thing about being an autistic person in this space - the political realm is not exempt from my black and white perspective.\n\nMy inner sense of right and wrong, just and unjust, is ingrained so deeply that it is unshakeable, whether it puts my safety at risk and makes me unpopular or not. People often seem perplexed that I continue to be vocal or to do what I do. They ask me if it's really worth it. My answer is that I don't have a choice. I am hard-wired to oppose what I believe is wrong and to stand up for what I think is right.\n\nWhich is why I find myself today almost paralysed. Confused and disappointed by the direction of the party I have given so much of my life to.\n\nWatching as that party leans into something I can't and have no willingness to defend. Feeling at odds with the party I have had so much faith in. Reading as those on the outside of it criticise the progressives on the inside, forgetting that for some of us, change isn't quite so easily swallowed or processed.\n\nI fiercely opposed a Kate Forbes (below) leadership bid last year, and remain very much of that persuasion. I think she is in many ways a capable leader, and can understand her appeal. But I will never support a candidate that vocally opposes social progress, and have seen the pockets of the right-wing that this kind of narrative appeals to.\n\nI don't believe a party that is meant to be progressive or left of centre should appeal to those pockets in any circumstance, regardless of the political appeal of the attempt to. There is being a broad church, and then there's just being a political party with no solid identity. Malleable to lurches in both directions of the political spectrum, and the inevitable erosion of public trust that goes with that.\n\nDespite what my Unionist critics will say, I don't want independence because I want to wave a flag. I want independence because I truly believe that it is the only route to the progressive, internationalist and forward-thinking nation that I know Scotland can be.\n\nI think, as do most indy supporters, that for as long as Scotland is weighed down by an outdated political institution like Westminster, its potential will be stifled.\n\nAnd I believe independence is not just a want, but a political need for the most vulnerable in our society who are failed unforgivably by our current political system, and who without independence will see little radical change in their circumstance.\n\nProgressing that core belief, however, cannot come at the sacrifice of social progress. What is the point of independence for our nation, if not to make it a better place? And why would anyone vote for it if the independent nation we are offering to the electorate doesn't offer the radical change they want and need?\n\nI understand the predicament politically that the SNP find themselves in. It has, without question, been difficult times for the party since the departure of Nicola Sturgeon (below).\n\nIt was always going to be. But with a new leader at the helm, and the promise of stability going forward, it was also an opportunity for the party to re-cement its progressive values.\n\nTo undo at least some of the damage that has been done to our progressive reputation over the past few years, and to re-affirm that the SNP are the party of progress. Fairness. Equality.\n\nInstead, and in the sole interest of saving our political skin, we now have a Deputy First Minister who has said she \"couldn't conceive of having an abortion\". And who would not have voted for equal marriage.\n\nA Deputy First Minister who said that her beliefs would influence her vote on such matters. I can't, in good conscience, defend it. I think the SNP have sold their soul in the interests of appeasing conservative voters. But winning an election won't matter when we look around and have abandoned our values.\n\nWhen we look around and the young progressives - the independence generation - have deserted us because we sold out their core beliefs for votes. When, perhaps most unforgivably, we look around and the LGBTQ community have lost the faith they once had in us.\n\nWhen we lose the vision for a progressive independent Scotland, we lose the debate. We are fighting for nothing if not progress - and if we lose sight of it, our argument collapses.\n\nREAD MORE: Kelly Given: Humza Yousaf's tenure will be remembered kindly\n\nSometimes the right thing to do is not the easiest, and I am positive a leadership contest would have been unhelpful for the party at this point in its journey - but a leadership contest, fought on the back of the values and principles I joined the SNP to promote and protect, would have been far more respectable than a back-door deal with social and fiscal conservatives to preserve our vote share.\n\nIntegrity is the hallmark of a good and trustworthy politician. In a society so jaded by politics, and so fed up with the grubbiness of it all, the worst possible move you can make is to sell yourself out for your own political gain.\n\nNot only is it morally wrong, it is entirely transparent - and the electorate will see it for what it is. It is the kind of politics Keir Starmer is a professional at. Not the kind of politics that the SNP indulge.\n\nThe SNP are the party I call home, and have done for a relatively long time. I have grown up in the party, and I have given a lot to it. Despite it all, I can't and won't be blindly loyal when I know in my heart that we have taken a wrong turn.\n\nThe SNP were once a safe space for marginalised groups, for people who believe wholeheartedly in the progressive argument for an independent nation. I think today yesterday finally eroded the very last of what was left of that reality.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Autism spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radical politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broad church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalism_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internationalism (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Berkshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/18059102/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552038", "eventUri": "eng-9552038", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

But I knew we were getting close to it.\"\n\nMr Salmond attributed part of the success of that election to the SNP's second-vote strategy, in which the party told Scots their second vote, on the regional ballot, should go to them to elect him as first minister.\n\nHe added it had been a campaign where \"everything went right\".\n\nMr Salmond said: \"Some campaigns everything goes wrong, it's happened to the SNP in the past, but that was a campaign where everything went right.\"\n\nSpeaking as Holyrood approaches the 25th anniversary of its first sitting on May 12, Mr Salmond said people across Scotland \"liked to be able to see that the Parliament had achieved things that matter, that are meaningful to the people\" such as free university education.\n\nNo longer an elected parliamentarian, he said that the Scottish Parliament was \"at its best and thought of the best the more ambitious it was for the country\".\n\nMeanwhile he urged those still at Holyrood: \"Keep your

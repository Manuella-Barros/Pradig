Stanford filed felony burglary charges against the 13 protestors, including one Stanford Daily reporter, for barricading themselves in the university president\u2019s and provost\u2019s office building. Involved students, who had bail set at $20,000, are banned from the campus until June 12, and seniors will not be allowed to graduate. The protestors demanded the school\u2019s divestment from Israel, financial disclosure from the 2022 fiscal year, and dropping disciplinary and criminal charges against all pro-Palestine students. \u201cThirteen individuals were arrested inside Building 10 this morning. In addition to going through the law enforcement process, any arrested individuals who are students will be immediately suspended. Any who are seniors will not be allowed to graduate. These actions are necessary based on the public safety threat posed to our campus community,\u201d wrote Stanford Interim President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez. Stanford also cleared out the school\u2019s pro-Palestine demonstration site, saying, \u201cThe situation on campus has now crossed the line from peaceful protest to actions that threaten the safety of our community.\u201d Stanford had allowed the site to remain occupied since April, making the escalation to felony charges and site dispersal a quick turn of events. Sit-ins at the president\u2019s office have a long history at Stanford, such as from the Vietnam War era. Stanford\u2019s website hosts an exhibit on many such instances of activism, including 1980s South Africa divestment protestors occupying the president\u2019s office. Stanford\u2019s core mission statement is outlined in a vision centered on embedding \u201cinclusion, civic engagement and a respect for robust discourse in education and residential life, preparing students for lives of active citizenship.\u201d The school\u2019s website even hosts a detailed archive of campus activism stretching back to 1891.

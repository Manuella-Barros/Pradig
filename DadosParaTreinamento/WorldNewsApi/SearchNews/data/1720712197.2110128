They need to also know the signs. They also need to know how not to be an abuser.\" Tara, who volunteers at the Gabby Petito Foundation as the administrator and bookkeeper, says, \u201cA lot of times they could just say, \u2018Oh, I love you so much, let's have a joint Snapchat.\u2019 But that starts with the controlling and, \u2018I want to view everything that you're doing.\u2019 So, they might not even realize that's the start of an abusive type of relationship. We would like to get into the schools and teach them to know what the signs are.\u201d Tara, 43, along with Gabby\u2019s father Joe Petito and Gabby\u2019s mother Nichole Schmidt and her husband Jim, created the Gabby Petito Foundation shortly after the death of the 22-year-old budding YouTube blogger, who disappeared on a cross-country journey with her fianc\u00e9 Brian Laundrie in the summer of 2021. Her body was later discovered near a campground in Wyoming. Laundrie, who died by suicide, was found in a nature preserve near his family\u2019s home in North Port, Fla., on Oct. 20, along with a backpack containing what the FBI described as a notebook \u201cclaiming responsibility\u201d for Gabby\u2019s strangulation death. The foundation focuses on raising awareness about domestic violence while also creating tougher laws and policies governing how police respond to reports of intimate partner abuse and missing persons. For more on Gabby Petito's legacy, subscribe now to PEOPLE, or pick up this week's issue, on newsstands Friday. The foundation has also championed the National Domestic Violence Hotline \u2014 to which they donated $100,000 in 2022 to help build the group\u2019s capacity \u2014 along with the Black and Missing Foundation and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. \u201cPeople are paying more attention to these issues, especially domestic violence,\u201d says Nichole, who along with Joe, Jim and Tara spoke on a panel at CrimeCon 2024 Nashville. \u201cWe get emails all the time from people saying, \u2018Gabby saved my life. She gave me the power to get out of my abusive relationship.\u2019 Survivors are coming out and telling their stories. Laws are changing and we\u2019re going to keep fighting.\u201d \u201cWe have to prevent this from happening to other people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt keeps us strong. Gabby works through us. We have to move forward and change the world together.\u201d Adds Joe, 45, a warehouse store chain manager who specializes in policy and legislation for the foundation, \"When you help one person, you ... help change the course of their life in a positive way, and you want to do that again.\" Jim, 42, who focuses on domestic violence awareness training for first responders for the foundation, says it is \u201coverwhelming\u201d how many people are affected by the crime. \u201cIt really made us come to the realization they need a lot of help out there, and if we can just help one or two along the way, it goes a long way,\" he says.

Tara says the non-profit would like to start a domestic violence prevention program for elementary, middle and high school students. \u201cThere are programs out there, so we don't really want to reinvent the wheel, but we would love to get a free program for all schools to be able to join in on this program to help with it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe're still learning. We're trying to learn as much as possible.\u201d \u201cWe might not see the changes happen for a couple of years, but kids need to know,\u201d says Tara. If you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org. All calls are toll-free and confidential.

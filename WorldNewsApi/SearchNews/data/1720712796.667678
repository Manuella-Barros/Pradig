This represents Clare\u2019s seventh Munster final defeat since 1998, but they will rue six wides shot from frees and the chance from Mark Rodgers that cannoned off the post in the second half. The Treaty men didn\u2019t threaten many goals, but in the middle of the second half they capitalised on a botched pass towards Peter Duggan to deliver a ball that eluded Clare full-back Conor Cleary. Lurking with intent was Gearoid Hegarty and his groundstroke was drilled under Banner goalkeeper Eibhear Quilligan. From that point on, Limerick exerted the sort of pressure they are comfortable with. Clare had their periods of dominance but their lack of cutting edge was exposed.

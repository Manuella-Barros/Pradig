While the who's who of Bollywood have been attending the ceremonies, superstar Shah Rukh Khan, who shares a close bond with the family, was nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe biggest names of B-town, including Salman Khan, Ranveer Singh, and others were seen performing at Anant and Radhika's sangeet recently, which ended with a concert by none other than Justin Bieber.

Later, the family travelled to the US and have been spending some time in solace there.\n\nHowever, Shah Rukh is expected to return to Mumbai before Anant and Radhika's wedding on July 12. It is to be noted that his eldest son Aryan Khan attended the sangeet night on Friday on behalf of his family, and was also spotted enjoying another party in the city recently.\n\nOn the work front, SRK is soon set to begin the shoot of his next, titled King.

This film, featuring Alia Bhatt in the lead, was co-produced by Bhatt's Eternal Sunshine Productions and Shah Rukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment.\n\nIn a recent interview with Mashable India, Vijay opened up about his experience working on a Shah Rukh Khan production and interacting with the superstar. Despite not having acted alongside Khan, Vijay shared that working under his production banner provided multiple opportunities to meet and engage with him.\n\nVijay praised Khan for his unique ability to make one feel special. He mentioned, \"He never makes you feel like you are having a business meeting with him. The conversation always feels personal, and he makes you believe that he only thinks about you the whole day.\"\n\nElaborating on this sentiment, Vijay humorously remarked, \"Inke jeevan mein agar koi hai toh woh main hoon, aur ye apni family se bhi baat karte honge mere baare mein, khaate waqt bhi meri hi filme lagaate honge (I am the only one around whom his life revolves, he must be talking about me with his family also, even while having his meal, he must be watching my film).\" This, he said, illustrates how Khan makes you feel incredibly special and valued.\n\nVijay also recounted telling SRK to call him whenever he wanted to talk, highlighting the personal rapport they share.\n\nCurrently, Vijay Varma is busy promoting 'Mirzapur' season 3, in which he plays a double role.

King Khan once again managed to rule the box office with his latest release Jaawan.\n\nMalayalam actor Jagadish's words about Shah Rukh are gaining attention. Jagadish opened up about his experience working with him. He said the bollywood actor has a remarkable ability to make his co-stars feel exceptionally special. He also spreads a lot of positive energy to his co-stars when he comes to the set.\n\n'I am lucky to have acted in three Hindi films. The films are Rajeev Kumar's Khushti, Priyadarshan directed Hungama and Billu Barber. I don't have words to say about SRK. Billu Barber was also a film produced by him. When Shah Rukh Khan, the producer, comes to the set, there is an energy. He is an actor of great spirits.\n\nHowever, he behaves humbly to all of us. He is not proud of being a producer.

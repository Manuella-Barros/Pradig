He later revealed in Spanish that the children were ages 4, 7 and 8, and shared that the 4-year-old was a little girl.\n\n\"All five victims were transported to SAMCI (San Antonio Military Medical Center) in pretty serious condition,\" Salazar continued. \"That's the latest information I'm able to release with regard to the injuries.\"\n\nThe officer went on to explain that they had \"some leads that we're following up on,\" adding that their organized crime group was at the scene following up.\n\nAnswering reporters' questions on the scene, Salazar said that a gray car had driven near where he was standing before \"two suspects got out on foot, walked around the front of the residence\" and then \"started shooting into the residence with long rifles.\"\n\nHe also noted that there may have been 20 to 25 shots fired with all five victims being inside the residence. \"I believe at least several of them were related,\" he added, noting that all the people inside were injured.\n\nRelated: Man Suspected of Murdering Surfers in Mexico Told Girlfriend He 'Killed' 3 Men, Court Hears\n\nThe officer also said he believes the residence was the intended target, explaining,

this point, I'm working on the premise that whoever shot into the house knew that there were kids,\" Salazar said. \"And I'll be honest with you if God forbid one of those children should come to pass, that charge is easily going to be upgraded to capital murder.\"\n\nAuthorities were unable to determine which way the suspects took off, adding that two suspects were on the run.\n\n\"We don't feel like this was a random shooting, the people here unfortunately knew who they were shooting at and I don't know that anyone can necessarily take great solace in that but just knowing that this is

investment in new special schools 'may be too little too late'", "body": "The Government's investment in new schools for children with special needs could be \"too little too late\", a school leaders' union has warned.\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) has announced the locations for 16 new free schools for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).\n\nIt comes after the Chancellor announced in his spring Budget that \u00a3105 million would be invested over the next four years to build new special schools, creating more than 2,000 additional places for children with Send in England.\n\nBut Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the union was worried the investment was \"too little too late\".\n\nGovernment data published in March found that around two in three special schools in England were at or over capacity in the last academic year.\n\nThere were approximately 4,000 more pupils on roll in special schools than the reported capacity, according to DfE data.\n\nMr Di'Iasio said: \"Government figures show that around two-thirds of special schools are at or over capacity, but these new special schools are unlikely to be up and running for several years.\n\n\"The pressure on places is happening right now and the lack of capacity in the system is the result of the Government's underinvestment in schools over the past 14 years.\n\n\"This is compounded by an absolute crisis in the special educational needs system in general with the level of need far outstripping the funding and specialist support that is available.\"\n\nHe added that the Chancellor's announcement of new special schools in his Budget in March did \"nothing to address the wider issue of the strain on special educational needs provision\".\n\n\"The new schools will take time to be built, and won't fix the current huge challenges schools and wider social care and health services are facing when it comes to lack of capacity, funding and staffing.\"\n\nHe added: \"Without significant investment across the whole system, pupils with Send will continue to be let down, despite schools' best efforts.\"\n\nA competition for academy trusts to run the new special schools will be launched in the coming days.\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan said:\u202f\"Special schools can truly transform children's lives, enabling pupils with special education needs and disabilities to thrive in environments that meet their needs.\n\n\"We're creating tens of thousands of special school places since 2010 and today's announcement takes us one step closer to our commitment of a record 60,000 more places for children with additional needs.\n\n\"I know how hard it can be for families trying to navigate the Send system, and the creation of more brilliant special schools is just one part of our plan to make sure every family and every child get the right support, in the right place at the right time.\"",

competition for academy trusts to run the schools will be launched in the coming days, the government said, but critics have argued the announcement isn't enough.\n\nMr Johnston said the 200 schools would provide 60,000 new places at special schools in total, but some parents told the BBC these still would not meet demand.\n\nThere were not enough resources to help children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) who can be taught within mainstream schools either, they added.\n\nMr Johnston said the budget for high-needs provision had gone up by 60% since 2019-20.\n\n\"What we know is that most children with special educational needs can have their needs met in a mainstream school,\" he said.\n\n\"Where that can we happen, we want it to happen.\n\n\"But of course there will always be some children that need a special school place, that's why we're creating 200 more special schools.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Herefordshire Council said it was delighted the county was among the areas to be included in the proposals.\n\nThe new Herefordshire special school will eventually cater for 80 children and young people, aged 2-16 years, with complex autism and severe learning difficulties, the authority said.\n\nCouncillor Ivan Powell, cabinet member for children and young people, said: \"This support will enable us to expand the number of specialist education places in Herefordshire, and enable more pupils to attend a school within their local community and to thrive in an educational environment that meet their needs well.\n\n\"We

get a brand new free special needs school for nearly 200 autistic pupils.\n\nFunding is to be given to BCP Council by the Department for Education's \u00a3105m nationwide investment in SEND services.\n\nA school for approximately 180 pupils, aged between three and 19 years and on the autism spectrum, will be built in Bournemouth within the next two years.\n\nCathi Hadley, BCP's director of children's services, said: \"This investment will help more children with special educational needs and disabilities receive a world-class education.\n\n\"Confirmation that a new school will be built in our area means we are providing vital specialist spaces for those pupils whose needs cannot be met in mainstream education.\n\nCathi Hadley\n\n\"But we also know that many children with SEND enjoy and achieve in mainstream education, and many parents want their children to be supported to stay there where they can.\n\n\"We have also been working hard with schools, our parent and carer forums and the DfE to increase specialist provision in mainstream schools where needed, so that those children who can enjoy and achieve in mainstream schools are able to do so.\n\n\"Alongside this work we continue to improve the timeliness of our services, with the backlog of educational health care plans (EHCPs) and educational psychologist (EPs) advice both reducing.\n\n\"We know it has been difficult for families to navigate the SEND system, but today's fantastic announcement of funding, and our improvement work, shows that we are committed to achieving the best for all the children and young people in BCP who need extra support to fulfil their full potential.\"\n\nIt's not clear exactly where the school will be built or how much money BCP Council is to receive at this stage.\n\nNews of this investment follows last month's announcement of a brand-new Dingley's Promise centre in Bournemouth.\n\nTobias Ellwood with education secretary Gillian Keegan (Image: Tobias Ellwood)\n\nBCP Council worked closely with the charity to provide a new nursery assessment centre to support children under five with SEND and their families.\n\nThe new centre aims to give children the best possible start in life by providing specialist support tailored to each child to help with their onward journey.\n\nAs part of the council's commitment to specialist provision, conversations with the DfE are continuing around a separate application for c\u00a35m capital funding to support the creation of a further specialist SEND provision for BCP's children and young people.\n\nIt's understood the school will be built in the east of Bournemouth, after MP Tobias Ellwood wrote to the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt on April 9 calling for it in his constituency.\n\nHe said: \"After multiple meetings with the Treasury and Department of Education calling for a new school, I am delighted to see Bournemouth has been selected as one of the 15 locations across the country to receive one.\n\n\"This is great news for Bournemouth.\"\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan added:\u202f\"I know how hard it can be for families trying to navigate the SEND system, and the creation of more brilliant special schools is just one part of our plan to make sure every family and every child get the right support, in the right place at the right time.\"", "source": {"uri": "bournemouthecho.co.uk", "dataType":

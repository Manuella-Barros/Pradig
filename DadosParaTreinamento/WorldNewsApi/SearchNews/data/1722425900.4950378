Friday morning at One Campus Martius, the city of Detroit\u2019s Office of Arts, Culture and Entrepreneurship (ACE) marked its fifth anniversary by announcing the 2024 Detroit ACE Honors winners, celebrating fine and performing artists who have given 25 years or more in service to Detroit arts. In a conversation with former WDIV-TV (Channel 4) anchor Carmen Harlan during the event, ACE director Rochelle Riley praised Mayor Mike Duggan for establishing the office in 2019 and said it\u2019s her pleasure to fight for the city\u2019s artists. \u201cI\u2019ve been to 28 countries,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe need to understand that we have the respect that we keep searching for, begging for, demand. People love Detroit. People know our Detroit artists; they are globally recognized. We don\u2019t pay attention. So my job is to make sure people know we\u2019re there.\u201d Still, she acknowledged major misconceptions about Detroit in other parts of the country, especially among those who\u2019ve never visited or come around in a long time. \u201c(Some) still think it\u2019s 1967. They still think that people burn cars, they still think that kids burn stuff on Halloween,\" Riley said. \"These are all things that have been attached to Detroit in a way that people don\u2019t see Detroit. All you\u2019ve got to do is get people here. I have friends who would not visit Detroit, (and) I finally got them to come. We rented a bed and breakfast \u2026 we went to the Motown Museum and went to a baseball game, and we had such fun, and they said, \u2018This is how you live?!\u2019 I said, \u2018What did you think I was doing?\u2019 \u201cEverybody in Detroit doesn\u2019t live in poverty. Everybody in Detroit doesn\u2019t need help. And those of us who can help, we do that just like you\u2019d do anyplace else. So, if we can get people to see the Detroit where we live, where we listen \u2026 Detroit has to claim it and own it. That\u2019s what I want us to do.\u201d 2024 Detroit ACE Honors recipients 2024\u2019s class of ACE honorees include: Marion Hayden, a Detroit-born jazz bassist and educator mentored by master trumpeter Marcus Belgrave.

The gallery, located in Midtown, continues to display fresh and daring art by respected creators. An award was also presented to The Ford Foundation for nearly a century of supporting the arts in Detroit. This group is the second class of honorees since ACE's advent; the previous ceremony was held in 2022. Catching up with the honorees \u201cArt has been an integral part of my life,\u201d N\u2019namdi said in a written statement, \u201cand it\u2019s so important for us here in Detroit because it is one of the things that binds us to each other and to our varied communities no matter what obstacles arise. I started the gallery to create a sense of community through art.\u201d Porter, who was on hand with her entire Detroit Public Theatre team supporting, was elated. \u201cI\u2019m humbled,\u201d Porter told the Free Press after the ceremony. \u201cI am dedicated to this city. \u2026 I wasn\u2019t born here, but once I got here, I got entrenched. I want to encourage and inspire especially seasoned artists. There\u2019s so many of us, and so many of us are still alive and thriving and working in our craft. \u201cKeeping the arts alive in the city is paramount, and the city\u2019s coming back big and bold. So I\u2019m honored to be among the giants. My motto is, \u2018What we need is quality theatre by any means necessary.\u2019\u201d Hayden, in a written statement, spoke of Detroit as her inspiration and guiding force. \u201cI love my city,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a hometown girl. I represent Detroit, literally, wherever I tour, and I talk about our beautiful city and our beautiful people and especially our artists, through my music. Detroit is a constant source of muse for me in my creative career.\u201d Massey, who\u2019s been in Detroit 47 years, said it\u2019s \u201cmind-blowing\u201d to be among legends as an ACE honoree. \u201cPublic art begins with the community it will serve,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, after nearly decades of creating large-scale public works of art for various cities, communities and neighborhoods throughout the Midwest, it is my belief that public art should be, first and foremost, meaningful to those who surround it.\u201d Waddles spoke of his love for Detroit and for helping others through music. \u201cIt\u2019s tremendously humbling to be thought of that well for a lifetime of work,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved this city, and it\u2019s always been a pleasure and honor to work here. I\u2019ve had many opportunities to move elsewhere. But I\u2019ve always thought it was important to add what God has given me to help try to enrich the community which I was born into.\" Making a positive impact During the ceremony, Detroit ACE also released The Quint Report, a 120-page book outlining the accomplishments and impact of the office over the last five years as it works to strengthen the city\u2019s creative workforce. \u201cArt is business,\u201d Riley said during the event. \u201cIf you\u2019re a dancer, you\u2019re a small business. If you\u2019re a musician, you\u2019re a small business \u2026 until you become a big business. And no matter what you do, if that\u2019s what you do, and if that\u2019s your passion, I don\u2019t want people to feel that if you are in Detroit \u2026 this has to be your side hustle. That is your job. That is a career. And I want to make sure that people have successful careers here in Detroit.\u201d Contact Free Press arts and culture reporter Duante Beddingfield at dbeddingfield@freepress.com.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hcnRzLzIwMjQvMDYvMjgvZGV0cm9pdC1vZmZpY2UtYXJ0cy1jdWx0dXJlLWVudHJlcHJlbmV1cnNoaXAtYWNlLWhvbm9ycy1jZXJlbW9ueS83NDI0OTI2NjAwNy_SAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Detroit arts legends celebrated at Detroit ACE Honors ceremony</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Detroit Free Press</font>", "url": "https://eu.freep.com/story/entertainment/arts/2024/06/28/detroit-office-arts-culture-entrepreneurship-ace-honors-ceremony/74249266007/", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/28/PDTF/74249782007-ac-ehonors-062824-es-05.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2399,1350,x0,y53&format=pjpg&width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:15:24", "author": "Detroit Free Press", "authors": ["Detroit Free Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.246}

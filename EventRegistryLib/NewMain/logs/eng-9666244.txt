It was, in his opinion, dismal. The Long Island native, a veteran of Steven Cohen's SAC Capital and later Cheyne Capital, was so appalled with the burritos and tacos that he resolved to start his own restaurant.\n\n\"Back then, Mexican food was something to have while you were having a margarita,\" said Marks on Wednesday (Jun 19). \"I remember walking into my office one day and telling my business partner, 'I got the next big idea. We are gonna reintroduce Mexican food to this country'.\"\n\nThat became a reality in 2006 when he and childhood friend Robert Hazan opened the first Guzman y Gomez (GYG) in Newtown, a suburb in Sydney's inner west. Eighteen years later, GYG has 185 restaurants in Australia, 17 in Singapore, five in Japan and four in the US, boasting network sales of A$759 million (S$684 million) last year.\n\nGYG shares begin trading on Thursday on the Australian Securities Exchange under the ticker GYG with a valuation of A$2.2 billion. With a stake worth more than A$200 million, Marks, 52, is the second-biggest shareholder after investment firm TDM Growth Partners, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nGYG's offering will raise A$335.1 million, with A$200 million to fund expansion plans and the rest going to existing shareholders. GYG wants to eventually grow to 1,000 restaurants in Australia, about the same number as McDonald's and plans to open 30 to 40 new joints each year.\n\n\"I always called GYG fast food. And everyone was like, 'No, no, you are fast casual, McDonald's is fast food,'\" Marks said. \"I said, 'McDonald's isn't food.'\"\n\nThat did not deter Guy Russo, the former chief executive officer of McDonald's Australia, from investing in 2009. He's now GYG's chairman and owns a stake worth more than A$140 million, according to the wealth index. His son, Gaetano Russo Jr, is the franchise owner of three GYG restaurants.\n\nIt's not the only family connection: The son of GYG's co-CEO Hilton Brett has also has entered into a letter of intent to become the franchisee of a restaurant later this year.\n\nBrett was appointed last October, after the company indicated Marks would be stepping down as CEO due to a health scare that turned out to be minor. The resignation never happened.\n\nGYG's A$2.2 billion valuation works out to A$10.6 million per restaurant. By comparison, Chipotle Mexican Grill, a staple of the US fast-casual restaurant scene, is valued at more than A$40 million per store, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nLast week, GYG increased the size of the initial share sale by almost 40 per cent, making it Australia's largest offering in nearly a year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nAnalysts at Morningstar are cautious on the company's valuation, saying it's too early to grant GYG an \"economic moat\" - a competitive advantage keeping rivals at bay. They estimate shares are worth A$15 each, 32 per cent lower than GYG's offering price.\n\n\"We expect Guzman will maintain attractive store economics over the next decade,\" analysts lead by Johannes Faul wrote in a Jun 7 note. \"However, we need to see firm evidence that the brand and store economics are holding up as the store roll out progresses to award a moat and extend our optimism beyond the next 10 years.\"\n\nOn a statutory basis, GYG lost A$2.3 million last year and projects a further A$16.2 million loss for 2024 before a profit in 2025.\n\nMarks said he got used to hard work early. His father was a \"pool hustler from Miami Beach\" with addiction issues who left Marks' mother to raise him, his twin brother and his disabled older brother. By the time he was eight, Marks was doing odd jobs to support his family.\n\nBut a gift for numbers helped him win a place at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating in 1994, he was recruited \"by a guy named Stevie Cohen\", Marks said. He landed a job on the equities desk of Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC Capital, staying for four years before heading to Cheyne Capital in London.\n\nMarks said he learned to \"laser focus and never compromise\", but eventually decided he was sick of betting on other people's businesses. \"I want to have my own,\" he said, \"and that's why I moved to Australia\".

Hazan currently serves as a non-executive director.\n\nThe company has built its business model around offering customers Mexican-inspired, clean food, with a strong emphasis on quality ingredients.\n\nFast forward to today, GYG boasts 185 restaurants in Australia alone, with a global footprint extending to 210 locations across Singapore, Japan, and the US.\n\nIt has plans to open 30 new restaurants by FY25, and aims to increase this to 40 annually within five years. Drive-thru outlets will be a particular focus.\n\nThe company asserts that this ambitious expansion strategy supports its valuation exceeding $2.2 billion.\n\nGYG also prides itself on its dual approach to ownership, which includes both company-owned and franchise-operated models.\n\nRecognising the importance of the franchise model, GYG maintains a very healthy median Return on Investment of 51% for its Australian franchisees.\n\nThe company's impressive growth trajectory speaks for itself, with global network sales climbing from $101 million to $759 million between FY15 and FY23, and projected to reach $1,138 million by FY25.\n\n\"GYG has laid out a doubling of EBITDA from FY23 to FY25, and forecasts new restaurant openings at a rate far higher than it has experienced historically,\" said Talevski.\n\n\"But, there is the everyday observer's question of, how can a burrito-slinging outfit create this much value?\n\n\"So naturally there will be some trepidation from investors around the idea of backing a franchise that extrapolates such rapid growth in a prospectus,\" he added.\n\n\"After all, how many burritos can Australians really eat, and how will the franchise defend competition with such low barriers to entry?\n\n\"And as cost of living pressures prompt consumer belt-tightening and producer inflation remains unpredictable, can GYG really replicate the success it has had at scale?\" said Talevski.\n\nIn the Australian Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) market, competition is highly fragmented.\n\nThe top five brands - McDonald's, KFC, Hungry Jack's, Domino's, and Subway - account for roughly half of the industry's sales according to research firm, Morningstar.\n\nGYG has established its own niche by targeting a younger demographic with a focus on healthy dining options.\n\nBecause of its higher-quality offerings, customers tend to spend about 15% more per transaction at GYG outlets compared to other major chains.\n\nAs a result, GYG has achieved impressive average unit sales volumes of approximately $4 million per store, according to the prospectus, which is comparable to top performers like McDonald's and KFC in Australia.\n\nBut overseas, GYG could be facing challenges with its international expansion plans.\n\nIts restaurants in Japan and Singapore operate under a master franchise agreement, and only contribute about 2% to EBITDA during normal business conditions.\n\nThe US stores, meanwhile, are currently losing money, and it's unlikely they'll turn a profit in the near future.\n\nMorningstar also pointed out that despite GYG's promising growth, it has yet to establish an economic moat in the cut-throat restaurant industry.\n\nMorningstar's moat rating is a measure of how strong a company's competitive advantage is. So when a company is assigned \"no moat,\" it suggests that it lacks significant competitive advantages or barriers that would protect it from competitors.\n\nMorningstar believes GYG's success hinges on maintaining strong store-level economics, which could be challenging amid its ambitious expansion plans and international ventures.\n\n\"The restaurant space is highly competitive. Switching costs are nonexistent for patrons, and barriers to entry are relatively low.\n\n\"We also think Guzman is likely to struggle to achieve a meaningful presence in the US against well-established and strong competitors both within the Mexican niche, like wide-moat Chipotle, and McDonald's.\"\n\nWhile GYG's growth potential is recognised, Morningstar believes there are more attractive investment opportunities on the ASX.\n\nThese include peers such as Domino's Pizza (ASX:DMP) and Collins Foods (ASX:CKF) - the operator of KFC and Taco Bell in Australia. Both these stocks are trading at significant discounts to their fair value, says the research firm.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Morningstar also suggests caution.\n\n\"Our fair value estimate for GYG is $15 per share. Against this, the $22 offer price is too high.\"\n\nGYG plans to issue a total of 11.1 million shares at $22 each, aiming to raise approximately $335.1 million for an initial market cap of around $2.2 billion.\n\nAfter accounting for approximately $210 million worth of shares already allocated to cornerstone investors, the shares available for the public are only around $125 million.\n\nKey institutional investors such as Aware Super, Cooper Investors, and Hyperion Asset Management have expressed support, along with existing shareholders like TDM Growth Partners and Barrenjoey Private Capital.\n\nThere are obviously some big names on that shareholder list which have been influential advocates for the company's business model and valuation, says Talevski.\n\n\"So much so that they have all agreed to escrow their shareholdings until the delivery of FY25 results to help calm the waters. But will it be enough?\" he said.\n\nThe proceeds from the IPO will be used to fuel GYG's growth strategy, primarily focused on expanding its corporate restaurant network in Australia.\n\nCo-founder and CEO Steven Marks has recently reaffirmed GYG's plans to grow its Australian network to over 1,000 restaurants, comparable to McDonald's, over the next two decades.\n\n\"We truly believe that fast food doesn't have to be bad food,\" said Marks.\n\n\"We look forward to sharing our food with more guests across Australia and overseas as we look to realise our plans to grow the network to more than 1,000 restaurants over the next 20+ years.\"\n\nMany analysts however have raised doubts about the company achieving this ambitious goal.\n\n\"As we saw with the NYSE listing of fitness franchise F45, it's one thing to plan growth on paper, and another to execute in the real world,\" said Talevski.\n\nAnd whether long-term performance lives up to expectations will take years to prove, he added.\n\nHowever, for now, Talevski says he's keeping a keen eye on whether investors will pay up for future growth and remain invested to see the stock stabilise post-IPO.\n\n\"Should it manage to do that when trading commences on the ASX, this will no doubt be a positive signal for other IPO hopefuls seeking the right window in which to list.\"\n\nThe views, information, or opinions expressed

As there is so much attention on the company, I am going to outline what attracts me to it and why I plan to buy shares.\n\nIt's scheduled to trade on the ASX on Thursday, 20 June 2024, on a conditional and deferred settlement basis. Normal trading is expected on the ASX on a normal settlement basis on 25 June 2024.\n\nThe business is planning to raise $200 million in primary proceeds and $135.1 million through existing investors selling down some of their stake.\n\nThe Mexican food company has grown significantly in the last several years.\n\nIn FY15, the business generated $101 million of global network sales, which increased to $759 million in the 2023 financial year. That's a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% over the period. Management is expecting further growth in the coming years.\n\nGuzman y Gomez has forecast that global network sales can increase to $954.4 million in FY24 and $1.14 billion in FY25. That would be an increase of around 50% between FY23 and FY25.\n\nI believe GYG can continue to grow its global network sales at a double-digit rate for years to come because of its growing Australian and international presence.\n\nThe company's pro-forma (underlying) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is expected to increase from $29.3 million in FY23 to $59.9 million in FY25.\n\nSome successful businesses have generated excellent returns by expanding their store networks. Just think about global winners like McDonald's, Yum! Brands, and Chipotle.\n\nI'm not suggesting GYG will do as well as those businesses. On the ASX, Collins Foods Ltd (ASX: CKF) has done very well for shareholders over the past decade. But GYG isn't a franchisee business like Collins Foods, so GYG can benefit from franchisee sales growth locally or globally.\n\nGuzman y Gomez has a hybrid restaurant ownership model with a mix of corporate and franchise restaurants. It has 185 restaurants in Australia, including 62 corporate restaurants and 123 franchise restaurants. The business has four corporate restaurants in the US.\n\nGYG also has 16 restaurants in Singapore and five restaurants in Japan which are owned and operated by separate master franchisees. GYG earns royalty revenue from franchisee sales.\n\nIn Australia, GYG expects to open 30 new restaurants in FY25 and thinks it can increase its annual openings to 40 per year within five years. It thinks it can reach over 1,000 Australian locations over the \"next 20+ years\". The Guzman y Gomez listing value may not be cheap, but I'm thinking about where the business may be in three years, five years and ten years, not just its position in June 2024.\n\nThe company plans to expand in the US, though it will \"continually assess and adjust the pace of restaurant expansion to ensure it is underpinned by robust restaurant economics.\" It's expecting to have seven US stores in FY25, up from four now.\n\nBecoming bigger can help drive the underlying profit margins and value of the business.\n\nInvestors often like to value a business based on how much profit it's making now and what it can make in the future. Rising profit margins can help the bottom line grow even faster than revenue.\n\nGuzman y Gomez showed in its prospectus that its EBITDA to global network sales margin was 3.8% in FY22 and 3.9% in FY23. GYG projects this to increase to 4.5% in FY24 and 5.3% in FY25. Rising margins are a promising sign of economies of scale.\n\nIn five years, the Mexican food business could be much bigger and earn even stronger margins (on much higher revenue), which bodes well for future profit.\n\nThere could be a lot of volatility with GYG shares in the short term because some investors think they're overvalued, and others think they have compelling long-term value. I'm planning to start with a minimal investment and then buy more on any weakness or buy more over time as the business executes its store rollout plan and delivers high margins.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motley Fool Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristan_harrison@fool.com.au", "name": "Tristan Harrison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzman_y_Gomez", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guzman y Gomez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexican cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Franchising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collins Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chain store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipotle_Mexican_Grill", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipotle Mexican Grill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yum!

Thursday's IPO is Australia's largest in nearly a year, with shares up 36% from the offer price. Funds will fuel GYG's plan to expand to 1,000 outlets in Australia over the next 20 years.\n\nAsia's version of Chipotle -- a Mexican fast-casual chain called Guzman y Gomez -- just went public in Australia.\n\nShares of the quick-service restaurant began trading on the Australian Securities Exchange on Thursday. The initial public offering brings GYG's valuation to 2.2 billion Australian dollars, or $1.47 billion.\n\nThe IPO is Australia's biggest in nearly a year. The Sydney-based chain sought to raise about $162 million, or about one-sixth of the company's value, through the limited-sale offering.\n\nIn the first few hours after trading, the company's shares climbed 36% from the offer price of about $15.\n\nAccording to GYG's prospectus, the company will use the money to expand to more than 1,000 outlets in Australia over the next two decades. McDonald's and Subway have about 970 and 1220 restaurants in Australia, respectively.\n\nGYG was founded by a former hedge fund trader, Steven Marks, in Sydney in 2005. It now has 185 restaurants in Australia, 17 in Singapore, five in Japan, and four in the US. The company said it notched $506 million in sales last year.\n\n\"We are still early in our mission to reinvent fast food and change the way the masses eat,\" Marks said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nIn comparison, Chipotle has 3,400 restaurants across North America and Europe. The US-based Mexican fast food chain is valued at $94 billion and posted a revenue of nearly $10 billion last year. Chipotle owns and operates all of its restaurants, unlike GYG, which follows a franchise model. Franchisors make money from an annual licensing fee and take a percentage of the location's revenue.\n\nMixed analyst sentiment\n\nDespite the chain's growth in the last two decades, some analysts are bearish.\n\nIn a Wednesday note before the IPO, Morningstar analysts valued the stock at 15 Australian dollars a share. They said that the offer price of 22 Australian dollars was expensive, given that GYG is at a far earlier stage than heavyweight competitors like McDonald's and Domino's. And they're not sure GYG can follow through on its plan to open 1,000 stores.\n\nGYG is backed by TDM Growth Partners, Barrenjoey Private Capital, Aware Super, Cooper Investors, Hyperion Asset Management, Firetrail Investments, and QVG Capital.\n\n\"The company and its highly conflicted investors and advisors have decided that A$2.2 billion is a reasonable valuation of this business,\" Michael Hutchens, the founder of financial modeling company Modano, wrote in a post on LinkedIn.\n\n\"This is irrespective of fact that it is struggling to make money and would in fact have gone broke over the past year if it didn't quietly do a pre-IPO raising of A$135 million,\" Hutchens wrote.\n\nGYG joins 11 other companies that have listed on the ASX so far this year. The ASX has seen a big slowdown in IPOs in the last few years as pandemic stimulus payments ended and the central bank raised interest rates to calm inflation. The number of floats in 2023 was 45, compared to 107 in 2022 and a record 241 listings in 2021.\n\nGYG's shares are not open to the general public. They are only available to institutional investors, eligible employees and franchise holders, and retail clients of brokerages who have been allocated GYG shares, the company said in a pre-IPO

The initial public offering brings GYG's valuation to 2.2 billion Australian dollars, or $1.47 billion.\n\nThe IPO is Australia's biggest in nearly a year. The Sydney-based chain sought to raise about $162 million, or about one-sixth of the company's value, through the limited-sale offering.\n\nIn the first few hours after trading, the company's shares climbed 36% from the offer price of about $15.\n\nAccording to GYG's prospectus, the company will use the money to expand to more than 1,000 outlets in Australia over the next two decades. McDonald's and Subway have about 970 and 1220 restaurants in Australia, respectively.\n\nGYG was founded by a former hedge fund trader, Steven Marks, in Sydney in 2005. It now has 185 restaurants in Australia, 17 in Singapore, five in Japan, and four in the US. The company said it notched $506 million in sales last year.\n\n\"We are still early in our mission to reinvent fast food and change the way the masses eat,\" Marks said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nIn comparison, Chipotle has 3,400 restaurants across North America and Europe. The US-based Mexican fast food chain is valued at $94 billion and posted a revenue of nearly $10 billion last year. Chipotle owns and operates all of its restaurants, unlike GYG, which follows a franchise model. Franchisors make money from an annual licensing fee and take a percentage of the location's revenue.\n\nMixed analyst sentiment\n\nDespite the chain's growth in the last two decades, some analysts are bearish.\n\nIn a Wednesday note before the IPO, Morningstar analysts valued the stock at 15 Australian dollars a share. They said that the offer price of 22 Australian dollars was expensive, given that GYG is at a far earlier stage than heavyweight competitors like McDonald's and Domino's. And they're not sure GYG can follow through on its plan to open 1,000 stores.\n\nGYG is backed by TDM Growth Partners, Barrenjoey Private Capital, Aware Super, Cooper Investors, Hyperion Asset Management, Firetrail Investments, and QVG Capital.\n\n\"The company and its highly conflicted investors and advisors have decided that A$2.2 billion is a reasonable valuation of this business,\" Michael Hutchens, the founder of financial modeling company Modano, wrote in a post on LinkedIn.\n\n\"This is irrespective of fact that it is struggling to make money and would in fact have gone broke over the past year if it didn't quietly do a pre-IPO raising of A$135 million,\" Hutchens wrote.\n\nGYG joins 11 other companies that have listed on the ASX so far this year. The ASX has seen a big slowdown in IPOs in the last few years as pandemic stimulus payments ended and the central bank raised interest rates to calm inflation. The number of floats in 2023 was 45, compared to 107 in 2022 and a record 241 listings in 2021.\n\nGYG's shares are not open to the general public. They are only available to institutional investors, eligible employees and franchise holders, and retail clients of brokerages who have been allocated GYG shares, the company said in a pre-IPO release.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This, in his opinion, is humiliating. The Long Island native, a veteran of Steven Cohen's SAC Capital and later Cheyne Capital, was so smitten with burritos and tacos that he decided to start his own restaurant.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n\"Back then, Mexican food was something you had to have when you had a margarita,\" Marks said in an interview Wednesday. \"I walked into my office one day and said to my business partner, 'I've got the next big idea. We're going to reintroduce Mexican food to this country.'\n\nIt became a reality in 2006 when he and childhood friend Robert Hassan opened the first Guzman y Gomez in Newtown, a suburb in Sydney's inner west. Eighteen years later, the Mexican-themed fast food chain has 185 restaurants in Australia, 17 in Singapore, five in Japan and four in the US, boasting network sales of A$759 million ($506 million) last year.\n\nGuzman y Gomez Ltd. The shares began trading on the Australian Securities Exchange on Thursday under the ticker GYG at a valuation of A$2.2 billion. After investment firm TDM Growth Partners, Marks, 52, has shares worth more than A$200 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nShares rose 36% to A$30 in the company's trading debut at 12:23pm in Sydney.\n\nTaking McDonald's\n\nGYG's offer will raise A$335.1 million, with A$200 million to fund expansion plans, with the remainder going to existing shareholders. GYG eventually wants to grow to 1,000 restaurants in Australia, the same number as McDonald's, with plans to open 30 to 40 new joints each year.\n\n\"I always call GYG fast food. Everyone said, 'No, no, you're fast casual, McDonald's is fast food,'\" Marks said. \"I said, 'McDonald's is not food'.\"\n\nThat didn't stop former McDonald's Australia CEO Guy Russo from investing in 2009. He is now chairman of GYG and owns more than A$140 million in shares, according to the Asset Index. His son, Gaetano Russo Jr., owns three GYG restaurants.\n\nIt's not the only family connection: GYG's co-CEO Hilton Brett's son has also entered into a letter of intent to become a restaurant owner later this year.\n\nBrett was appointed last October after the company indicated Marks would step down as CEO due to a health scare that turned out to be minor. The resignation never happened.\n\nGYG's A$2.2 billion valuation is A$10.6 million per restaurant. By comparison, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., a staple of the U.S. fast-casual restaurant scene, is valued at more than $40 million per store, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nEconomic moats\n\nLast week, GYG raised the size of its initial share sale by nearly 40%, making it Australia's biggest offering in nearly a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMorningstar Inc. Analysts are wary of the company's valuation, saying it is too early to give GYG an \"economic moat\" -- a competitive advantage that would keep rivals at bay. Their shares are worth A$15 each, 32% below GYG's offer price.\n\n\"We expect Guzm\u00e1n to maintain attractive store economics over the next decade,\" analysts led by Johannes Fall wrote in a June 7 note. \"However, as the store moves forward to deliver a moat and extend our confidence beyond the next 10 years, we should see solid evidence that the brand and store economics are sustainable.\"\n\nOn a statutory basis, GYG lost A$2.3 million last year and forecasts a further loss of A$16.2 million in 2024 before turning a profit in 2025.\n\nMarx says that he was early accustomed to hard work. His father was \"a pool hustler from Miami Beach\" with a drug addiction who left Marx to raise his mother, his twin brother, and his disabled older brother. By the age of eight, Marx was doing odd jobs to support his family.\n\nBut his gift for numbers helped him gain a place at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating in 1994, he was \"hired by a guy named Stevie Cohen,\" Marks said. He spent four years at Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC Capital's equity desk before moving to Cheyne Capital in London.\n\nMarks said he learned to be \"laser focused and never compromise,\" but eventually decided he was sick of betting on other people's businesses. \"I wanted to be on my own, that's why I moved to Australia,\" he said.\n\n-With assistance from Andrew Heathcote.\n\n(The fifth column adds stock performance after trading introduction.)", "source": {"uri": "highlandstoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mid Florida Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_lindsey@highlandstoday.com", "name": "Joe Lindsey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexican cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzman_y_Gomez", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guzman y Gomez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.A.C._Capital_Advisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.A.C.

It was, in his opinion, dismal. The American, a veteran of US hedge fund SAC Capital and later Cheyne Capital in London, was so appalled with the burritos and tacos that he resolved to start his own restaurant.\n\nIn 2006, Mr Marks and childhood friend Robert Hazan opened the first Guzman y Gomez (GYG) in Newtown, a suburb in Sydney's inner west. Eighteen years later, GYG has 185 restaurants in Australia, 17 in Singapore, five in Japan and four in the US, boasting network sales of A$759 million (S$684 million) last year.\n\nGYG shares begin trading on June 20 on the Australian Securities Exchange with a valuation of A$2.2 billion. With a stake worth more than A$200 million (S$180 million), Mr Marks, 52, is the second-biggest shareholder after investment firm TDM Growth Partners, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nGYG's offering will raise A$335.1 million, with A$200 million to fund expansion plans and the rest going to existing shareholders. GYG wants to eventually grow to 1,000 restaurants in Australia, about the same number as McDonald's, and plans to open 30 to 40 new joints each year.\n\nThat didn't deter Guy Russo, the former chief executive officer of McDonald's Australia, from investing in 2009. He's now GYG's chairman and owns a stake worth more than A$140 million, according to the wealth index.

The success signals positive investor sentiment despite a challenging market, raising the company's market capitalization to about A$3 billion.\n\nMexican food chain Guzman Y Gomez served up Australia's best initial public offering debut in three years with its shares leaping more than one-third on their first trading day on Thursday, sending an upbeat signal about investor sentiment. The Sydney startup's stock began trading at A$29.90 at midday local time (0200 GMT), a 36% premium to their A$22 issue price, against a flat overall market. They closed slightly higher at A$30.\n\nIt was the biggest first-day gain by a large Australian company since 2021 and the country's third-best performing IPO in five years, according to Dealogic. The company put up A$335.1 million ($224 million) of new stock, about one-sixth of the company, for trading. The share price increase raises the company's market capitalisation to about A$3 billion, from A$2.2 billion before its trading debut. In its listing prospectus, the company forecast a second consecutive net loss for 2024 but a profit in 2025 and outlined a plan to match the current Australian store count of McDonald's in 20 years.\n\nGuzman Y Gomez's (GYG) initial issue was closed to the public and largely involved selling shares to existing financiers and franchise owners. The share price surge on Thursday sends a hopeful signal about broader sentiment after high interest rates and inflation squashed demand through 2022 and 2023. Australian listings collapsed after a record 2021 as pandemic stimulus payments ended and the central bank raised interest rates to slow inflation. In 2024 so far, Australia has raised just A$98 million in IPOs, the second-lowest June half in more than a decade, according to LSEG data.\n\n\"It proves the adage that you can list a good company even in a bad market,\" said Campbell Welch, an adviser at Novus Capital who ran a small IPO for health services provider Freedom Care in November, one of 32 new listings in the country in 2023, compared with nearly 200 in 2021. \"It's pretty fully valued and a lot of things have to go right now to justify the valuation.\" A prospectus filed in May generated rolling headlines about GYG's target of opening at least 30 stores per year from 183 in Australia currently - a rate it has achieved just once, in 2023 - and about its omission of store lease liabilities and share-based payments from earnings projections. It also has outlets in Japan, Singapore and the United States.\n\nThe company said its accounting treatment of expenses was typical of franchise businesses. \"Once we're listed, the market will price us every day and our focus will be on the things we can control: selling burritos and delivering on our strategy,\" GYG founder and co-CEO Steven Marks said in a statement before the start of trading.\n\nThe company was not immediately available for comment. A Morningstar client note previously valued the stock at A$15 a share, saying the company with 3.5% of the country's fast food market had not established a competitive advantage which would justify its rapid expansion.\n\nSebastian Evans, chief investment officer at NAOS Asset Management, said GYG's small share register and ambitious growth narrative may support the stock given its familiarity with Australians. \"We will follow the business and have done so for some time, but we believe the significant ramp-up in store rollout and the proposed geographic split of these new stores adds to the amount of execution risk,\" Evans said.\n\n($1 = 1.4990 Australian dollars)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

The shares gained another percentage point to A$30.30 by 3.05pm.\n\nIt was the biggest first-day gain by a large Australian company since 2021 and the country's third-best performing IPO in five years, according to Dealogic.\n\nThe company put up A$335.1 million (US$224 million) of new stock, about one-sixth of the company, for trading. The share price increase raises the company's market capitalisation to about A$3 billion, from A$2.2 billion before its trading debut.\n\nIn its listing prospectus, the company forecast a second consecutive net loss for 2024 but a profit in 2025 and outlined a plan to match the current Australian store count of McDonald's in 20 years.\n\nGuzman Y Gomez's (GYG) initial issue was closed to the public and largely involved selling shares to existing financiers and franchise owners. The share price surge on Thursday sends a hopeful signal about broader sentiment after high interest rates and inflation squashed demand through 2022 and 2023.\n\nAustralian listings collapsed after a record 2021 as pandemic stimulus payments ended and the central bank raised interest rates to slow inflation. In 2024 so far, Australia has raised just A$98 million in IPOs, the second-lowest June half in more than a decade, according to LSEG data.\n\n\"It proves the adage that you can list a good company even in a bad market,\" said Campbell Welch, an adviser at Novus Capital who ran a small IPO for health services provider Freedom Care in November, one of 32 new listings in the country in 2023, compared with nearly 200 in 2021.\n\n\"It's pretty fully valued and a lot of things have to go right now to justify the valuation.\" A prospectus filed in May generated rolling headlines about GYG's target of opening at least 30 stores per year from 183 in Australia currently - a rate it has achieved just once, in 2023 - and about its omission of store lease liabilities and share-based payments from earnings projections. It also has outlets in Japan, Singapore and the United States.\n\nThe company said its accounting treatment of expenses was typical of franchise businesses.\n\n\"Once we're listed, the market will price us every day and our focus will be on the things we can control: selling burritos and delivering on our strategy,\" GYG founder and co-CEO Steven Marks said in a statement before the start of trading.\n\nThe company was not immediately available for comment.\n\nA Morningstar client note previously valued the stock at A$15 a share, saying the company with 3.5 per cent of the country's fast food market had not established a competitive advantage which would justify its rapid expansion.\n\nSebastian Evans, chief investment officer at NAOS Asset Management, said GYG's small share register and ambitious growth narrative may support the stock given its familiarity with Australians.\n\n\"We will follow the business and have done so for some time, but we believe the significant ramp-up in store rollout and the proposed geographic split of these new stores adds to the amount of execution risk,\" Evans said.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"},

The Sydney startup raised its market capitalisation to A$3 billion from A$2.2 billion, amidst investor optimism. The company plans a major expansion, aiming to match McDonald's Australian store count in 20 years.\n\nMexican food chain Guzman Y Gomez served up Australia's best initial public offering debut in three years with its shares leaping more than one-third on their first trading day on Thursday, sending an upbeat signal about investor sentiment. The Sydney startup's stock began trading at A$29.90 at midday local time (0200 GMT), a 36% premium to their A$22 issue price, against a flat overall market. The shares gained another percentage point to A$30.30 by 0505 GMT.\n\nIt was the biggest first-day gain by a large Australian company since 2021 and the country's third-best performing IPO in five years, according to Dealogic. The company put up A$335.1 million ($224 million) of new stock, about one-sixth of the company, for trading. The share price increase raises the company's market capitalisation to about A$3 billion, from A$2.2 billion before its trading debut.\n\nIn its listing prospectus, the company forecast a second consecutive net loss for 2024 but a profit in 2025 and outlined a plan to match the current Australian store count of McDonald's in 20 years. Guzman Y Gomez's (GYG) initial issue was closed to the public and largely involved selling shares to existing financiers and franchise owners. The share price surge on Thursday sends a hopeful signal about broader sentiment after high interest rates and inflation squashed demand through 2022 and 2023.\n\nAustralian listings collapsed after a record 2021 as pandemic stimulus payments ended and the central bank raised interest rates to slow inflation. In 2024 so far, Australia has raised just A$98 million in IPOs, the second-lowest June half in more than a decade, according to LSEG data. \"It proves the adage that you can list a good company even in a bad market,\" said Campbell Welch, an adviser at Novus Capital who ran a small IPO for health services provider Freedom Care in November, one of 32 new listings in the country in 2023, compared with nearly 200 in 2021.\n\n\"It's pretty fully valued and a lot of things have to go right now to justify the valuation.\" A prospectus filed in May generated rolling headlines about GYG's target of opening at least 30 stores per year from 183 in Australia currently - a rate it has achieved just once, in 2023 - and about its omission of store lease liabilities and share-based payments from earnings projections. It also has outlets in Japan, Singapore and the United States. The company said its accounting treatment of expenses was typical of franchise businesses.\n\n\"Once we're listed, the market will price us every day and our focus will be on the things we can control: selling burritos and delivering on our strategy,\" GYG founder and co-CEO Steven Marks said in a statement before the start of trading. The company was not immediately available for comment.\n\nA Morningstar client note previously valued the stock at A$15 a share, saying the company with 3.5% of the country's fast food market had not established a competitive advantage which would justify its rapid expansion. Sebastian Evans, chief investment officer at NAOS Asset Management, said GYG's small share register and ambitious growth narrative may support the stock given its familiarity with Australians.\n\n\"We will follow the business and have done so for some time, but we believe the significant ramp-up in store rollout and the proposed geographic split of these new stores adds to the amount of execution risk,\" Evans said.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nIn the first few hours after trading, the company's shares climbed 36% from the offer price of about $15.\n\nAccording to GYG's prospectus, the company will use the money to expand to more than 1,000 outlets in Australia over the next two decades. McDonald's and Subway have about 970 and 1220 restaurants in Australia, respectively.\n\nGYG was founded by a former hedge fund trader, Steven Marks, in Sydney in 2005. It now has 185 restaurants in Australia, 17 in Singapore, five in Japan, and four in the US. The company said it notched $506 million in sales last year.\n\n\"We are still early in our mission to reinvent fast food and change the way the masses eat,\" Marks said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nIn comparison, Chipotle has 3,400 restaurants across North America and Europe. The US-based Mexican fast food chain is valued at $94 billion and posted a revenue of nearly $10 billion last year. Chipotle owns and operates all of its restaurants, unlike GYG, which follows a franchise model. Franchisors make money from an annual licensing fee and take a percentage of the location's revenue.\n\nDespite the chain's growth in the last two decades, some analysts are bearish.\n\nIn a Wednesday note before the IPO, Morningstar analysts valued the stock at 15 Australian dollars a share. They said that the offer price of 22 Australian dollars was expensive, given that GYG is at a far earlier stage than heavyweight competitors like McDonald's and Domino's. And they're not sure GYG can follow through on its plan to open 1,000 stores.\n\nGYG is backed by TDM Growth Partners, Barrenjoey Private Capital, Aware Super, Cooper Investors, Hyperion Asset Management, Firetrail Investments, and QVG Capital.\n\n\"The company and its highly conflicted investors and advisors have decided that A$2.2 billion is a reasonable valuation of this business,\" Michael Hutchens, the founder of financial modeling company Modano, wrote in a post on LinkedIn.\n\n\"This is irrespective of fact that it is struggling to make money and would in fact have gone broke over the past year if it didn't quietly do a pre-IPO raising of A$135 million,\" Hutchens wrote.\n\nGYG joins 11 other companies that have listed on the ASX so far this year. The ASX has seen a big slowdown in IPOs in the last few years as pandemic stimulus payments ended and the central bank raised interest rates to calm inflation. The number of floats in 2023 was 45, compared to 107 in 2022 and a record 241 listings in 2021.\n\nGYG's shares are not open to the general public. They are only available to institutional investors, eligible employees and franchise holders, and retail clients of brokerages who have been allocated GYG shares, the company said in a pre-IPO release.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubhangi_goel@businessinsider.com", "name": "Shubhangi Goel", "type":

"Mexican-themed fast food restaurant chain Guzman y Gomez has stunned on its debut on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), surging 36 percent on the market on its first day of trade.\n\nThe company joined the ASX at 12 p.m. on June 20 with an initial public offering price (IPO) of $22 per share.\n\nBy the close of trade, Guzman y Gomez's shares had rocketed by 36 percent to $30, and the company is now worth more than $3 billion.\n\nThe listing has been dubbed by investors as the biggest public offering on the Australian market in three years.\n\nIn Australia, the company has 185 restaurants including 62 corporate restaurants and 123 franchise restaurants.\n\nFurther, the company has 16 restaurants in Singapore and four in Japan, along with four corporate restaurants in the United States.\n\nThe company is planning to open 1,000 stores in Australia over the next 20 years including 30 per year in the immediate future.\n\nAt an IPO ceremony at the ASX building in Sydney on June 20, Mr. Marks described the listing as \"emotional.\"\n\n\"We've been working so hard for 20 years, and the values and culture is so strong, and we're building this amazing business, and hopefully, you can see that today,\" he told media.\n\n\"This is a big milestone for all of us, and it's truly just the beginning.\"\n\nThe company's IPO valued the company at a market capitalisation of $2.2 billion, before it surged to more than $3 billion.\n\nAhead of the listing, Guzman y Gomez (GYG) said proceeds of the IPO would be used to fund GYG's growth strategy over coming years.\n\nMr. Marks said over the last 18 years, the team at GYG have been obsessed with providing guests with the freshest, cleanest, and fastest made-to-order Mexican-inspired food.\n\nCo-CEO Hilton Brett said he expects GYG's sales growth to continue via the opening of new restaurants and increasing sales in existing restaurants.\n\n\"In addition to our delicious food, that growth has been underpinned by compelling restaurant economics which has allowed us to invest in our restaurant network, our teams and our systems,\" he said.\n\nGYG says one of its core values is \"it's all about the food,\" providing customers with Mexican-inspired clean food.\n\n\"The quality of its food is central to its operational model, with every item of food on its Australian menu prepared using 100 percent clean ingredients from September 2019,\" the company said ahead of its IPO.\n\nThe company's global network sales rose from $101 million to $759 million between the 2015 and 2023 financial year.\n\nGYG's fast food peers on the ASX include Collins Foods, operator of KFC and Taco Bell, and Domino's Pizza Enterprises.\n\nDomino's shares rose 0.44 percent on the ASX to $36.48 on June 20, while Collins Foods shares leaped 0.54 percent to $9.30.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

How the shares perform will send a signal about broader sentiment after high interest rates and inflation squashed demand through 2022 and 2023.\n\nAustralian listings collapsed after a record 2021 as pandemic stimulus payments ended and the central bank raised interest rates to slow inflation. In 2024 so far, Australia has raised just A$98 million in IPOs, the second-lowest June half in more than a decade, according to LSEG data.\n\n\"Guzman Y Gomez will be a bit of a bellwether,\" said Campbell Welch, an adviser at Novus Capital who ran a small IPO for health services provider Freedom Care in November, one of 32 new listings in the country in 2023, compared with nearly 200 in 2021.\n\n\"It's still pretty tough to raise money but some of these things look like they're resolving themselves. I don't see why it can't succeed.\"\n\nA prospectus filed in May generated rolling headlines about GYG's target of opening at least 30 stores per year from 183 in Australia currently - a rate it has achieved just once, in 2023 - and about its omission of store lease liabilities and share-based payments from earnings projections.\n\nThe company said its accounting treatment of expenses was typical of franchise businesses.\n\n\"Once we're listed, the market will price us every day and our focus will be on the things we can control: selling burritos and delivering on our strategy,\" GYG founder and co-CEO Steven Marks said in a statement.\n\nA Morningstar client note valued the stock at A$15 a share, below its A$22 issue price, saying the company with 3.5% of the country's fast food market had not established a competitive advantage which would justify its rapid expansion.\n\nWithout that advantage \"we are hesitant to fully bake in management's 1,000-store long-term projection\", Morningstar analyst Johannes Faul wrote.\n\n\"The restaurant space is highly competitive. Switching costs are nonexistent for patrons and barriers to entry are relatively low.\"\n\nSebastian Evans, chief investment officer at NAOS Asset Management, said GYG's small share register and ambitious growth narrative may support the stock given its familiarity with Australians.\n\n\"We will follow the business and have done so for some time, but we believe the significant ramp-up in store rollout and the proposed geographic split of these new stores adds to the amount of execution risk,\" Evans said.\n\nEmanuel Datt, principal of investment manager Datt Capital, said the fact GYG considered a private sale before choosing a listing - as reported by Australian media - indicates \"public markets may be falling back into favour.\"\n\n($1 = 1.4997 Australian dollars)\n\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye;

The Australian IPO landscape saw a significant drop-off after 2021 with the conclusion of pandemic stimulus payments and subsequent interest rate hikes. In the first half of 2024, only A$98 million was raised through IPOs - the second-lowest June half in over a decade. Now, with GYG stepping up, there's renewed hope. Though the company expects a net loss in 2024, it aims for profitability by 2025 and plans to expand aggressively, looking to match McDonald's store count in Australia within 20 years.\n\nThe performance of GYG's shares could signal broader market sentiment shifts after a period plagued by high interest rates and inflation, both of which have previously dampened investor demand. If GYG thrives, it might rekindle investor interest and confidence in the Australian IPO market.\n\nThe bigger picture: Reviving market confidence.\n\nAdvisers at Novus Capital are optimistic about GYG's chances, despite the tough capital-raising environment. The company's decision to opt for a public listing over a private sale might indicate growing confidence in public markets.

Now, the real adventure begins -- one filled with retail shareholders, ASX disclosures, and public financial reporting.\n\nGYG shares are up 36% to $30.00 in afternoon trade.\n\nYou might wonder: Who are the burrito believers, the enchilada embracers, and the quesadilla crusaders? The people putting their money behind the Mexican-inspired fast-food joint growing into a more valuable company in the years to come.\n\nNo need to wonder. Let me spill the beans on Guzman y Gomez shares.\n\nAscribed a market capitalisation of around $2.2 billion, investors of GYG are hungry for growth. The valuation translates to an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) multiple of 32.5 times -- a figure attracting plenty of scepticism.\n\nDespite this, many existing shareholders held tight to their stakes throughout the IPO. An insatiable appetite of investors wanting in and insiders not giving up much meant the public offer was heavily oversubscribed -- reportedly 20 times as much.\n\nNow making its way onto the ASX, we know who the biggest investors are of this in-demand listing.\n\nAs shown above, the largest owner of Guzman y Gomez shares is TDM Custodial Services at 28.23%. Being a 'custodial service', this would be shares held by Sydney-based TDM Growth Partners on behalf of its clients.\n\nOther notable holders in the top 10 are co-founders Steven Marks and Robert Hazan. The third largest holding is Evan Jason Pty Limited, denoted as 'Marks Family account'. Meanwhile, Hazan lands sixth on the list through an investment held under RBH Pty Limited.\n\nThe top 20 investors hold 85.71% of shares in Guzman y Gomez.\n\nWith a further 14.29% (or 14.5 million shares) unaccounted for, who are the other investors?\n\nIt's hard to know exactly. Shareholders outside the top 20 are not required to be disclosed to the public.\n\nHowever, there's a good chance that most of the remaining investors are the general public -- people like you and me. After all, the fast-food company issued 11.1 million GYG shares as part of its IPO.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motley Fool Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mitchell_lawler@fool.com.au", "name": "Mitchell Lawler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Motley Fool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzman_y_Gomez", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guzman y Gomez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burrito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchilada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enchilada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quesadilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quesadilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/investor-does-mexican-wave-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666244", "eventUri": "eng-9666244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Learn More\n\nTime is ticking down to one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) the ASX has seen in years. Tomorrow, Guzman y Gomez shares will join the ASX boards, giving all Australian investors the opportunity to buy shares in this Mexican-themed fast food chain.\n\nAs we've covered extensively here at the Fool, Guzman's ASX IPO has been long in the making. After years of rumours, the company will make its ASX debut tomorrow when its shares begin trading on the public markets on a deferred settlement basis from midday - 11.1 million Guzman shares, to be precise.\n\nYep, the company hopes to float 11.1 million shares on the ASX, with an IPO price of $22 a pop. If all goes to plan, that would value the business at around $2.2 billion. The restaurant chain's ticker code is set to be the easily-memorable GYG.\n\nAs we've also covered this month, this valuation could be described as 'optimistic'. My Fool colleague James recently went through the views of Tamim Asset Management's Ron Shamgar. There was an extract of what the fund manager had to say on Guzman's \"eye-watering\" $22 IPO price:\n\nThe IPO values GYG at an enterprise value to operating earnings multiple of 32.5 times, significantly higher than Domino's Pizza at around 18 times and Collins Foods Limited at just over 14 times...\n\nWhile GYG's growth ambitions are impressive, investors would be wise to approach this IPO with caution. The rich valuation in comparison to other QSR players raises questions about whether the hype surrounding the offering is justified...\n\nHistory has shown that many high-profile IPOs struggle to live up to their lofty expectations once the initial excitement fades. Rather than getting caught up in the frenzy, prudent investors may be better served by waiting on the sidelines to see how GYG's growth story unfolds as a public company.\n\nThis is notable. If Guzman does command a market capitalisation of $2.2 billion, it would slide right between KFC operator Collins Foods Ltd (ASX: CKF) and Domino's Pizza Enterprises Ltd (ASX: DMP). Domino's and Collins Foods currently boast market caps of $1.09 billion and $3.3 billion respectively.\n\nInterestingly, when Collins Foods debuted on the ASX boards back in 2011, it floated at a stock price of $2.50. But only a few months later, early investors were nursing a nasty burn when the company fell down to less than $1.20 per share.\n\nOf course, those who held on have done well, given that Collins Foods stock was asking $9.26 at Wednesday's close. But no doubt, those investors who buy Guzman shares when they list on the ASX will be hoping for a different outcome.\n\nPotential Guzman investors might find confidence in the fact that management and the company's largest investors will be in their bunker, financially speaking. Even after Guzman's IPO, senior management (including founder Steven Marks) and existing substantial investors will still hold 62% of the company's outstanding stock.\n\nNo doubt these big fish will be the ones watching tomorrow's Guzman IPO with the most anticipation.

In 2024 so far, Australia has raised just A$98 million in IPOs, the second-lowest June half in more than a decade, according to LSEG data.\n\n\"It proves the adage that you can list a good company even in a bad market,\" said Campbell Welch, an adviser at Novus Capital who ran a small IPO for health services provider Freedom Care in November, one of 32 new listings in the country in 2023, compared with nearly 200 in 2021. \"It's pretty fully valued and a lot of things have to go right now to justify the valuation.\"\n\nA prospectus filed in May generated rolling headlines about Guzman Y Gomez's target of opening at least 30 stores per year from 183 in Australia currently - a rate it has achieved just once, in 2023 - and about its omission of store lease liabilities and share-based payments from earnings projections. It also has outlets in Japan, Singapore and the United States.\n\nThe company said that its accounting treatment of expenses was typical of franchise businesses. \"Once we're listed, the market will price us every day and our focus will be on the things we can control: selling burritos and delivering on our strategy,\" Guzman Y Gomez founder and co-CEO Steven Marks said before the start of trading. The company was not immediately available for comment.\n\nA Morningstar client note previously valued the stock at A$15 a share, saying the company with 3.5 per cent of the country's fast food market had not established a competitive advantage which would justify its rapid expansion.\n\nSebastian Evans, chief investment officer at NAOS Asset Management, said that Guzman Y Gomez's small share register and ambitious growth narrative may support the stock given its familiarity with Australians. \"We will follow the business and have done so for some time, but we believe the significant ramp-up in store rollout and the proposed geographic split of these new stores adds to the amount of execution risk,\" Evans said.

Guzman y Gomez owns everything, including the brand, IP, recipes and systems.\n\nIt's easy to sound smart by being gloomy about the future of a stock, doing a useful service by shocking financial investors into mending their irrational ways to avoid the looming disaster; that's what bears do. But the future of Guzman y Gomez will likely be positive, possibly outstripping expectations by a long margin. Like any good venture capitalists, the first road to success for a company begins with its founder.\n\nUS-born founder and chief executive Steve Mark has the right charisma and upbeat tone to drive the corporate culture forwards - from the mantra of the \"clean is the new healthy\" branding to how the company has involved staff in fundraising events since 2008 for Misi\u00f3n M\u00e9xico, an Australian-founded charity that helps young people in Tapachula, Mexico, break the cycle of poverty.\n\nMarks underpins this culture with a clear communication style that articulates the company's growth strategy for all stakeholders, especially investors. This approach has successfully pulled in Capital Research Global Investors, which own stakes in Chipotle, Yum! Brands and Mediterranean food chain Cava. Other industry bigwigs include Matthew Grounds at Barrenjoey, Aware Super, Cooper Investors, Hyperion, Firetrail and QVG.\n\nThe product is the best quick-service restaurant chain in Australia. When we go out for a fast-food experience, my young daughters want Guzman y Gomez over McDonald's or KFC. They might be too young to be stock analysts, but they certainly reflect the desire of a quality offering.\n\nFurthermore, the franchise works and the stores make a lot of money (second to McDonald's). It's a good time to remember that sales revenues have risen consistently over the past 10 years and the growth looks to increase. So even if Marks matches the understated growth forecasts for 2025, the stock is almost guaranteed to do well.\n\nChipotle has a market capitalisation of $136 billion. Which one has the highest probability of going up 2x or 5x or 10x? I know which one I would own. Guzman y Gomez tastes better than Chipotle, in my opinion, and it's no doubt the reason Capital Research Group Investors, who are large investors in Chipotle, are coming into Guzman y Gomez.\n\nMarks' short-term goals are modest, even as the IPO prospectus has forecast for FY25. They plan to add 30 stores by the end of the 2025, which will certainly boost revenues from an estimated $339 million by June 30, 2025, to $428 million, at a growth rate of 37.6 per cent. Meanwhile, EBITDA is forecast to grow slightly faster, at 39.3 per cent, which means they should comfortably beat the FY25 forecast.\n\nAdd to this that the power of passive money in the market is undeniable. In Australia, that is dominated by the S&P/ASX 200. At Guzman y Gomez's market capitalisation - once escrowed shares are released - 30 per cent of the register will have to be held by passive index funds. The market has its own machinations of funds trading around the passive index funds, and it's the reason Guzman y Gomez is an important ASX arrival.\n\nSuccess for Guzman y Gomez is largely guaranteed, and if you take a medium-to-long-term view, then the price of the IPO is less relevant. If Guzman y Gomez meets or exceeds their FY25 results, then it certainly has justified that this spicy burrito is a recipe for high growth.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzman_y_Gomez", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guzman y Gomez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Collins Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningstar,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morningstar, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-food_restaurant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fast-food restaurant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domino's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino's_Pizza_Enterprises", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domino's Pizza Enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipotle_Mexican_Grill", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipotle Mexican Grill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franchising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yum!

The Nuix IPO was a disaster for the ages that probably spared Adore Beauty the blushes of that distinction. And the ghost of Myer still haunts after all these years.\n\nSo the local market can't really stomach another flop.\n\nOf course, this time could very well be different.\n\nWhat we can say for certain is this IPO pitch is coming off a long run-up. Ever since Hamish Douglass bought into Guzman y Gomez to fire up Magellan's private capital business back in 2020, the general investing public has been primed to believe this is a great business.\n\nThat investment was then passed over to Barrenjoey's high-net-worth clients to fire up their asset management business.\n\nAnd then Guzman y Gomez found its way into the Hearts & Minds charity fund, even forcing it to rewrite its investment mandate. Each time, the valuation has ticked up.\n\nSo this IPO has been a long time coming and Sydney's most skilled bankers are fully invested and highly incentivised to make this work.\n\nA bet on Guzman y Gomez, at least in the short term, is a bet on their abilities to orchestrate a successful listing. That's how some of the smart money is playing it.\n\nThe float has been limited in size, creating some scarcity. The equity funds that have bought in must be confident that the stock will trade up until the end of the financial year so they can book performance fees.\n\nAfter that, Guzman y Gomez could be ready for index inclusion, putting further upward pressure on the stock as passive funds squeeze in. This is a float that doesn't even need that much goodwill to work.\n\nIn the long run, the performance of Guzman y Gomez and its ability to grow in line with the optimism of its prospectus will no doubt determine its long-term fate.\n\nHere there is division. The forward valuation looks high, but others say the earnings may be undercooked and it may deliver.\n\nWhile analysts are pulling apart the numbers, we've been searching for comparable listings to better understand the scars and biases.\n\nIn 2010, QR National privatised via an IPO, and the media and local fund managers were scolded for being too negative.\n\nBankers told us the global investor base apparently understood the rail industry better, so they rightly backed the deal.\n\nBut years later, a broker suggested that management may have been a little more open about the rationalisation in their Paris and London meetings than the Melbourne briefings.\n\nAnother comparable is Collins Food. That IPO was a disaster, but it turned out that despite a few early stumble the management were the real deal. The trick was to buy it cheaper than the offer price.\n\nBankers will be hoping that the US markets provide some positive omens. The best IPO of the past 12 months there has been restaurant chain Cava, which has doubled in value since its July 2023 float and trades on a price to earnings multiple of 185 times.\n\nMexican fast food chain Chipotle also split investors but has delivered a 4500 per cent return to investors and is a hedge fund favourite.\n\nThe last time a chief executive ran around town in a hoodie and Morgan Stanley bumped off Goldman Sachs for a lucrative role, the float went very well indeed. Investors in the Facebook IPO aren't worried about the price any more.\n\nIf Guzman y Gomez's bankers can get a float away at an expensive valuation that might bode well for other companies trying to list - particularly PE firms that are waiting for a stronger market.\n\nThere are also a bunch of private venture companies - mostly of the soured 2021 vintage - waiting for a whiff of optimism to be offloaded so impatient investors can be reunited with their money.\n\nSo, if you liked Guzman y Gomez, you'll love the long line that sits behind it.\n\nAnd so we're torn. We're all fully invested in our public markets. The ASX needs good companies to list, and replace those that are going private or going offshore. Good IPOs are good for everyone.\n\nBut the scars of bad floats run deep, and so the investing public has every right to question what's been sold.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news",

Learn More\n\nThe Guzman y Gomez Ltd (ASX: GYG) share price soared more than 30% on its first day on the ASX, trading at around $30. Investors that bought shares at $22 are already sitting on big gains.\n\nInterested prospective investors now face a difficult question: Is the Mexican food business a good investment or too expensive?\n\nI wrote several days ago that I planned to buy GYG shares. After seeing such a strong rise on the opening day, I decided not to buy at $30 on the first day amid the strong buying interest.\n\nPut simply, a large number of investors wanted to buy while not many shares were for sale. The management and large institutional investors seemed to want to keep their shares, so buyers had to pay what sellers were asking for if they wanted shares on the first day.\n\nAccording to reporting by the Australian Financial Review, Cyan Investment Management's Dean Fergie believes it was fear of missing out (FOMO) that led to the huge increase in the Guzman y Gomez share price. Fergie said:\n\nI feel the whole price is a bit engineered, there's not a lot of free float, so you're not getting new buyers in there. And the people that are in there have an incentive to keep the share price high in the short term.\n\nIf you're a big fund with a pile of money, you're probably going to be buying a few shares to keep the price nice and high ... so my cynical view is that until all the escrows are out and there's a bunch of free float for the stock, I don't know how relevant the actual price is for the long-term valuation.\n\nI feel the bottom-line earnings numbers, even taking into account potential growth going forward, just don't stack up from a valuation perspective - I'm a fundamental bottom-line investor rather than a hype and excitement kind of guy.\n\nThere's two sides of the coin, you've got people who are invested and they're either believers or want to ride the hype and they're pumping it up, and then there are others like me that aren't involved and saying this just doesn't make any financial sense.\n\nIt must be noted that the IPO price was $22 (and franchisees were able to buy shares through the IPO offer at $18). Shares issued through the IPO will be allotted on 24 June 2024 and can be traded on 25 June 2024.\n\nOnce some new shareholders see they can sell their shares at a good, quick profit, I wouldn't be surprised to see the GYG share price move back at least a little towards the listing price of $22.\n\nIf investors believe GYG can become a much bigger business in five years, then today could represent a good price for the long term, but I expect it to see a lot of volatility.\n\nThe business now has a market capitalisation of $3 billion, and it's expected to generate underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) of $43 million in FY24. That puts it at around 70x FY24's underlying EBITDA, which looks high to me, at least for the short term.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motley Fool Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristan_harrison@fool.com.au", "name": "Tristan Harrison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Motley Fool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzman_y_Gomez", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guzman y Gomez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_float", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public float"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexican cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergie_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fergie (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Financial_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Financial Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franchising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Yellow-and-confetti-celebration-16_9-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666244", "eventUri": "eng-9666244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

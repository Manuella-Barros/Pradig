{"id": 225014984, "title": "Glasgow Riverside Festival organisers to host one-day event following cancellation", "text": "Bosses behind the Riverside Festival will host the \u201cultimate\u201d one-day event in Glasgow after the festival was cancelled due to increasing costs. The organisers of the electronic music event confirmed at the start of May they had made the \u201cextremely difficult decision\u201d to cancel following a ten-year run. They told their followers that the cancellation was due to \u201clower-than-expected sales and increased infrastructure, staff, transport, and artist costs, all in an over-saturated event landscape\u201d. However, bosses behind the event have now teamed up with Electric Frog to bring a one-off outdoor event to Glasgow\u2019s Riverside Museum on Saturday, August 31. Headlining the single stage event will be Australian-based DJ Skin on Skin, with his only Scottish show this year, and he will be joined by co-headliner KETTAMA. \u201cHeavyweight\u201d support will be provided from acts including La La, Hayley Zalassi and Dija. Riverside promoter Dave Clarke has described the event as the \u201cperfect way to end the summer\u201d. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to finally be able to share this news of what is our first outdoor, one main stage event at the Riverside Museum. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard behind the scenes to bring this exciting party to the Clydeside. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to welcome everyone down for a day of unmissable music, dancing and electric vibes. It\u2019s a great way to end the summer\u201d General sale for the event will be available from 10am, Monday, June 3.", "summary": "The one-day event, which will be held outside Glasgow\u2019s Riverside Museum, comes following the cancellation of the Riverside Festival.", "url": "https://news.stv.tv/west-central/glasgow-riverside-festival-organisers-to-host-one-day-event-following-cancellation", "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3e2fba76535ac049e2bd2029ba9d617a-1716983352.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:21:16", "author": "Calum Loudon", "authors": ["Calum Loudon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tv", "sentiment": 0.194}

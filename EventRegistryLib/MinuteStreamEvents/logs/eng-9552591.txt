More than 240 deaths have been associated with this major shock, according to the Japanese Red Cross Society.\n\nThe timing of the swarm was also unusual compared to the typical sequence of aftershocks, according to Frank.\n\n\"They have this statistical signature that suggests the earthquakes are driven by something else,\" he said.\n\nAn earthquake-affected road buried under snow on Japan's Noto Peninsula in January. Akram Muthanna/Anadolu via Getty Images file\n\nHe and the other study authors compared the pattern of earthquakes on the Noto Peninsula to a pattern of pressure within subsurface pores. This model takes into account factors above ground that change the pressure within the rocks beneath it, such as seasonal changes in sea level, fluctuations in atmospheric pressure, heavy rain, or snow events.\n\nThe results indicated that the weight of the snowpack on the Noto Peninsula led to increased pressure in those pores. The researchers believe that pressure changes from the addition and removal of weight as snow accumulates and then melts could destabilize pre-existing faults.\n\n\"If you have enough snow, it will push the ground down, and if you remove the snow, it will bounce back,\" Frank said.\n\nSome previous research has also suggested that environmental factors can play a role in initiating earthquakes. In a 2019 study, Shelley and his colleagues found that spring snowmelt flowing into cracks in the ground near a caldera in the area around Mammoth Lakes, California, likely triggered a cluster of earthquakes.\n\nMelting ice has rapidly recharged groundwater, and pressure changes appear to trigger activity on relatively shallow faults. The researchers found that seismic activity in the region has historically been about 37 times more likely during wet periods than during dry periods.\n\nSuch research has sparked scientists' curiosity about whether climate change could have a small effect on the behavior of earthquakes.\n\n\"There are more studies that show a link in some cases between the timing of earthquakes and these processes that occur at the surface,\" Shelley said. \"My understanding of climate change projections is that there is more extreme weather, more prolonged dry spells and more intense periods of rain. This may make these impacts more pronounced.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noto_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noto Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Advances", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science Advances"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_swarm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake swarm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stress (mechanics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Planetary science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Red_Cross_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japanese Red Cross Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_Society_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geological Society of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moment magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aftershock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowmelt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snowmelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caldera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fault (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_Lakes,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammoth Lakes, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mammoth Lakes, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240507-noto-eathquake-ch-1650-41bddf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552591", "eventUri": "eng-9552591", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-14", "textStart": 1796, "textEnd": 1806}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

But what if our weather and climate change could play a role too? A new study by MIT scientists suggests that heavy rains and snowstorms caused by climate change have the potential to trigger swarms of earthquakes.\n\nNoto Peninsula and earthquake swarm\n\nThe focus of the MIT study was on an area in Japan called the Noto Peninsula. This finger-shaped land mass has witnessed continuous seismic activity for more than a decade. The specific type of earthquake activity observed is known as an earthquake swarm, which is characterized by a series of small earthquakes that occur continuously without an obvious main event.\n\nResearchers at MIT aim to unravel the mysteries behind these persistent seismic disturbances on the Noto Peninsula. Their earthquake research went beyond the usual focus on subterranean activity and entered the world of climate change data.\n\n\"We see that snowfall and other environmental loading at the surface affects the stress state underground, and the timing of heavy rainfall events is closely linked to the onset of this earthquake swarm,\" noted William Frank, an assistant professor at MIT.\n\nMore about the earthquake swarm\n\nWhen we think of earthquakes, we usually envision one large shock followed by a series of smaller tremors. This sequence begins with the \"mainshock,\" the main and largest event of the earthquake, followed by smaller tremors known as \"aftershocks.\" These aftershocks can last for weeks, months, or even years as the Earth's crust adjusts after the initial rupture.\n\nBut an earthquake swarm works differently. Unlike a typical earthquake sequence that has a distinct mainshock, an earthquake swarm lacks a single, identifiable main event. Instead, it is characterized by a series of smaller, continuous earthquakes of roughly similar magnitude. A swarm may persist for days, weeks, or even months without a clear focal point.\n\nThe main difference between a typical earthquake sequence and an earthquake swarm is that there is no distinct main shock. In a traditional earthquake sequence, aftershocks generally decrease in strength over time.\n\nIn an earthquake swarm, tremors are of the same size and occur without a consistent pattern. While a typical earthquake sequence often follows a predictable decay pattern, a swarm can persist for an unpredictable period, sometimes extending over years.\n\nThis phenomenon is exactly what is shaking Japan's Noto Peninsula, a rugged region extending into the Sea of Japan. Since late 2020, hundreds of small earthquakes have rocked the region in an unusual swarm.\n\nInstead of starting with a main tremor, the Noto Peninsula swarm began with a gradual increase in seismic activity. The earthquakes intensified and clustered, producing continuous tremors in contrast to the main aftershock pattern.\n\nHistory of Japan\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Japan's Noto Peninsula is an area accustomed to occasional tremors. This area has a history of seismic activity extending back more than a decade. However, in recent years, these disorders have reached new heights. Since 2020, the peninsula has been a hotbed of small but persistent earthquake swarms.\n\nThe constant shaking has raised concerns and prompted a search for answers. The team of researchers from MIT decided to embark on an in-depth investigation, looking for patterns within the seismic history of the region. They carefully analyzed earthquake catalogs and records of past tremors, and delved into detailed meteorological data in search of a possible explanation for these severe earthquakes.\n\nClimate change and earthquake swarms\n\nBy analyzing the frequency of earthquakes on the Noto Peninsula, the researchers identified a clear seismic change. Before 2020, the occurrence of earthquakes appeared sporadic, with no clear pattern emerging. However, a dramatic shift occurred in 2020. The earthquakes began to cluster together tightly in time, signaling the start of the ongoing swarm.\n\nBut the real surprise came when the researchers studied seismic velocity, which is the speed at which waves resulting from earthquakes travel through the Earth's layers. This measurement revealed a noticeable relationship. Changes in earthquake speed appear to follow a seasonal rhythm, which interestingly aligns with the timing of the earthquake swarm.\n\nThis discovery raised a puzzling question: What environmental factor, caused by climate change, could affect the timing and intensity of earthquakes on the Noto Peninsula?\n\nSnow, climate change and earthquakes\n\nHeavy snowfall events also turn out to be an important piece of the puzzle. When snow accumulates, it adds enormous weight to the ground. This weight, combined with rainfall, increases what scientists call \"pore fluid pressure.\" This is the pressure exerted by fluids within small cracks and gaps in the rock below us.\n\nThink of it like a sponge. Submerged rocks, heavy by snow and rain, are more susceptible to forces deep underground, sometimes causing them to fail and slide -- leading to earthquakes. It is important to note that this does not replace plate tectonics as the primary cause of earthquakes, but it can act as a final push.\n\nEffects of climate change on earthquakes\n\nThe big question now is whether this link between climate events and earthquakes is limited to the Noto Peninsula in Japan, or if it has broader global implications. Researchers at MIT believe this association could extend beyond this single region. The findings suggest that other locations around the world may also be vulnerable to climate-influenced earthquakes.\n\nAs the undeniable reality of climate change unfolds, it brings with it an increase in extreme weather events. This includes periods of heavy rain and snowfall. The MIT study suggests that these intensified weather patterns could exacerbate the effects observed in Japan, leading to more frequent or even stronger earthquakes in vulnerable areas.\n\nThe research highlights the complex interaction between Earth's different systems - the delicate balance between the atmosphere, the solid ground beneath our feet, and the potential for seismic activity. Further investigations are needed to establish the relationship between climate change and earthquakes to identify specific areas that may be most at risk.\n\n\"If we are heading towards a changing climate, with more extreme rainfall events occurring... that will change how the Earth's crust is loaded,\" Professor Frank said.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Science Advances.\n\n-- -\n\nLike what I read?

Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have revealed a link between weather events and seismic activity\n\nFor centuries, scientists have focused on the collision of tectonic plates and subsurface faults as the main causes of earthquakes. However, the MIT study, led by Assistant Professor William Frank of MIT's Department of Earth, suggests that certain weather conditions, such as heavy snowfall and rain, can also play an important role in triggering seismic events.\n\nWeather events, earthquakes and seismic activity\n\nThe study focuses on a series of earthquakes that struck the Noto Peninsula in Japan, revealing a relationship between intense rainfall episodes and seismic activity. \"We see that snowfall and other environmental loading at the surface affects the stress state underground, and the timing of heavy rainfall is closely linked to the onset of this seismic swarm,\" according to Frank.\n\nIn contrast to a typical earthquake sequence, which is characterized by a mainshock followed by an aftershock, the Noto Peninsula experienced an \"earthquake swarm\" with multiple earthquakes continuing without any obvious mainshock.\n\nThe researchers analyzed seismic data over a period of 11 years, and noted the synchronization between changes in seismic velocity and seasonal patterns of snowfall and precipitation.\n\nEarthquake swarm\n\nThrough modeling, the team demonstrated how seasonal rainfall affects underground pore fluid pressure, which affects the propagation of seismic waves. \"When it rains or snows, it adds weight, which increases pore pressure, allowing seismic waves to travel through them more slowly,\" Frank explains. \"When all that weight is removed, through evaporation or runoff, suddenly, the pore pressure drops and the seismic waves become faster.\"\n\nThe study found that heavy snowfall events, in particular, were strongly linked to the timing of earthquakes on the Noto Peninsula. Frank emphasizes that while tectonic activity remains the primary cause of earthquakes, climatic factors can serve as secondary influencing factors.\n\nFrank and his team expect that similar weather-triggered seismic activity could occur in other regions around the world. As climate change leads to more extreme rainfall events, the impact of weather on earthquakes may become more pronounced in the future.\n\n\"When we first want to understand how earthquakes work, we look at plate tectonics, because that is the number one reason why earthquakes happen and always will,\" says Frank. \"But, what other things can affect when and how an earthquake occurs? That's when you start moving to second-order controlling factors, and climate is clearly one of those factors.\"\n\nArticles recommended by the editor\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noto_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noto Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seismic wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_swarm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake swarm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pore_water_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pore water pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fault (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plate tectonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stress (mechanics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reflection seismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aftershock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precipitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evaporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface runoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/iStock-1487001908.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552591", "eventUri": "eng-9552591", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

But what if our weather and climate change can also play a role? A new study led by MIT scientists suggests that the heavy rains and snowstorms caused by climate change have the potential to trigger earthquake swarms.\n\nThe focus of the MIT study was a region in Japan called the Noto Peninsula. This finger-shaped landmass has experienced ongoing earthquake activity for over a decade. The specific type of earthquake activity observed is known as an earthquake swarm, characterized by a series of smaller quakes happening continuously without a clear main event.\n\nThe researchers at MIT aimed to unravel the mysteries behind this relentless seismic unrest in the Noto Peninsula. Their investigation on earthquakes went beyond the usual focus on subterranean activity and ventured into the realm of climate change data.\n\n\"We see that snowfall and other environmental loading at the surface impacts the stress state underground, and the timing of intense precipitation events is well-correlated with the start of this earthquake swarm,\" noted William Frank, an assistant professor at MIT.\n\nWhen we think of earthquakes, we usually picture one large shock followed by a series of smaller tremors. This sequence starts with the \"mainshock,\" the primary and largest earthquake event, and is followed by smaller tremors known as \"aftershocks.\" These aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, or even years as the Earth's crust readjusts after the initial rupture.\n\nAn earthquake swarm, however, operates differently. Unlike a typical earthquake sequence that features a distinct mainshock, an earthquake swarm lacks a single, identifiable main event. Instead, it's characterized by a series of smaller, ongoing earthquakes of roughly similar magnitude. The swarm may continue for days, weeks, or even months without a clear focal point.\n\nThe key difference between a typical earthquake sequence and an earthquake swarm lies in the absence of a distinct mainshock. In a conventional earthquake sequence, aftershocks generally decrease in magnitude over time.\n\nIn an earthquake swarm, the tremors are of similar magnitude and occur without a consistent pattern. While a typical earthquake sequence often follows a predictable decay pattern, a swarm can last for an unpredictable period, sometimes stretching over years.\n\nThis phenomenon is precisely what's shaking up Japan's Noto Peninsula, a rugged region that juts into the Sea of Japan. Since late 2020, hundreds of small earthquakes have rattled the region in an unusual swarm.\n\nInstead of starting with a mainshock, the Noto Peninsula swarm began with a gradual increase in seismic activity. The earthquakes intensified and clustered, creating persistent tremors unlike the mainshock-aftershock model.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Japan's Noto Peninsula is a region accustomed to occasional tremors. This area has a history of seismic activity stretching back over a decade. However, in recent years, this unrest has reached new heights. Since 2020, the peninsula has become a hotbed of small but continuous earthquakes swarms.\n\nThe constant shaking has raised concerns and prompted a quest for answers. The team of MIT researchers decided to embark on an in-depth investigation, looking for patterns within the seismic history of the region. They meticulously analyzed earthquake catalogs and records of past tremors, and dove into detailed meteorological data in search of a potential explanation for these relentless quakes.\n\nBy analyzing earthquake frequency in the Noto Peninsula, the researchers pinpointed a distinct seismic change. Prior to 2020, the occurrence of quakes appeared sporadic, displaying no discernible pattern. However, a dramatic shift took place in 2020. Earthquakes began to cluster together tightly in time, signaling the initiation of the ongoing swarm.\n\nBut the real surprise came when researchers investigated seismic velocity - the speed at which earthquake-generated waves travel through Earth's layers. This measurement revealed a remarkable correlation. Changes in seismic velocity seemed to follow a seasonal rhythm, intriguingly aligned with the timing of the earthquake swarm.\n\nThis discovery raised a tantalizing question: What environmental factor, caused by climate change, could potentially influence the timing and intensification of earthquakes in the Noto Peninsula?\n\nHeavy snowfall events, as it turns out, are a critical piece of the puzzle. When snow piles up, it adds immense weight to the earth. This weight, combined with rainfall, increases what scientists call \"pore fluid pressure.\" That's the pressure fluids exert within the minuscule cracks and gaps in the bedrock beneath us.\n\nThink of it like a sponge. Waterlogged rock, heavy from snow and rain, is more susceptible to the forces deep underground, sometimes causing it to fail and slip - resulting in earthquakes. It's important to note that this doesn't replace plate tectonics as the earthquakes' primary cause, but it can act as the final push.\n\nThe big question now is whether this link between climate events and earthquakes is specific to Japan's Noto Peninsula, or if it has broader global implications. Researchers at MIT believe this connection could extend far beyond this single region. The findings suggest that other locations around the world might also be susceptible to earthquakes influenced by climate.\n\nAs the undeniable reality of climate change unfolds, it brings with it an increase in extreme weather events. This includes periods of intense precipitation and snowfall. The MIT study indicates that these intensified weather patterns could potentially exacerbate the effects observed in Japan, leading to more frequent or even stronger earthquakes in vulnerable areas.\n\nThe research underscores the complex interplay between various Earth systems - the delicate balance between the atmosphere, the solid ground beneath our feet, and the potential for seismic activity. Further investigations are needed to solidify the connection in climate change and earthquake to pinpoint the specific regions that might be most at risk.\n\n\"If we're going into a climate that's changing, with more extreme precipitation events...that will change how the Earth's crust is loaded,\" said Professor Frank.\n\nLike what you read?

Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have revealed a link between weather events and seismic activity\n\nFor centuries, scientists have focused on the collision of tectonic plates and subsurface faults as the primary triggers of earthquakes.

According to Frank, \"We see that snowfall and other environmental loading at the surface impacts the stress state underground, and the timing of intense precipitation events is well-correlated with the start of this earthquake swarm.\"\n\nUnlike typical earthquake sequences, which are characterised by a main shock followed by an aftershock, the Noto Peninsula experienced an \"earthquake swarm\" with multiple ongoing quakes and no obvious main shock.\n\nThe researchers analysed seismic data over 11 years and observed a synchronisation between changes in seismic velocity and seasonal patterns of snowfall and precipitation.\n\nThrough modelling, the team demonstrated how seasonal precipitation influences underground pore fluid pressure, which affects seismic wave propagation. \"When it rains or snows, that adds weight, which increases pore pressure, which allows seismic waves to travel through slower,\" Frank explains. \"When all that weight is removed, through evaporation or runoff, all of a sudden, that pore pressure decreases and seismic waves are faster.\"\n\nThe study found that heavy snowfall events, in particular, were strongly correlated with the timing of earthquakes in the Noto Peninsula.

The study is the first to show that climate conditions could initiate some quakes.\n\n\"We see that snowfall and other environmental loading at the surface impacts the stress state underground, and the timing of intense precipitation events is well-correlated with the start of this earthquake swarm,\" says study author William Frank, an assistant professor in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). \"So, climate obviously has an impact on the response of the solid earth, and part of that response is earthquakes.\"\n\nThe new study focuses on a series of ongoing earthquakes in Japan's Noto Peninsula. The team discovered that seismic activity in the region is surprisingly synchronized with certain changes in underground pressure, and that those changes are influenced by seasonal patterns of snowfall and precipitation. The scientists suspect that this new connection between quakes and climate may not be unique to Japan and could play a role in shaking up other parts of the world.\n\nLooking to the future, they predict that the climate's influence on earthquakes could be more pronounced with global warming.\n\n\"If we're going into a climate that's changing, with more extreme precipitation events, and we expect a redistribution of water in the atmosphere, oceans, and continents, that will change how the Earth's crust is loaded,\" Frank adds. \"That will have an impact for sure, and it's a link we could further explore.\"\n\nThe study's lead author is former MIT research associate Qing-Yu Wang (now at Grenoble Alpes University), and also includes EAPS postdoc Xin Cui, Yang Lu of the University of Vienna, Takashi Hirose of Tohoku University, and Kazushige Obara of the University of Tokyo.\n\nSeismic speed\n\nSince late 2020, hundreds of small earthquakes have shaken up Japan's Noto Peninsula - a finger of land that curves north from the country's main island into the Sea of Japan. Unlike a typical earthquake sequence, which begins as a main shock that gives way to a series of aftershocks before dying out, Noto's seismic activity is an \"earthquake swarm\" - a pattern of multiple, ongoing quakes with no obvious main shock, or seismic trigger.\n\nThe MIT team, along with their colleagues in Japan, aimed to spot any patterns in the swarm that would explain the persistent quakes. They started by looking through the Japanese Meteorological Agency's catalog of earthquakes that provides data on seismic activity throughout the country over time. They focused on quakes in the Noto Peninsula over the last 11 years, during which the region has experienced episodic earthquake activity, including the most recent swarm.\n\nWith seismic data from the catalog, the team counted the number of seismic events that occurred in the region over time, and found that the timing of quakes prior to 2020 appeared sporadic and unrelated, compared to late 2020, when earthquakes grew more intense and clustered in time, signaling the start of the swarm, with quakes that are correlated in some way.\n\nThe scientists then looked to a second dataset of seismic measurements taken by monitoring stations over the same 11-year period. Each station continuously records any displacement, or local shaking that occurs. The shaking from one station to another can give scientists an idea of how fast a seismic wave travels between stations. This \"seismic velocity\" is related to the structure of the Earth through which the seismic wave is traveling. Wang used the station measurements to calculate the seismic velocity between every station in and around Noto over the last 11 years.\n\nThe researchers generated an evolving picture of seismic velocity beneath the Noto Peninsula and observed a surprising pattern: In 2020, around when the earthquake swarm is thought to have begun, changes in seismic velocity appeared to be synchronized with the seasons.\n\n\"We then had to explain why we were observing this seasonal variation,\" Frank says.\n\nSnow pressure\n\nThe team wondered whether environmental changes from season to season could influence the underlying structure of the Earth in a way that would set off an earthquake swarm. Specifically, they looked at how seasonal precipitation would affect the underground \"pore fluid pressure\" - the amount of pressure that fluids in the Earth's cracks and fissures exert within the bedrock.\n\n\"When it rains or snows, that adds weight, which increases pore pressure, which allows seismic waves to travel through slower,\" Frank explains. \"When all that weight is removed, through evaporation or runoff, all of a sudden, that pore pressure decreases and seismic waves are faster.\"\n\nWang and Cui developed a hydromechanical model of the Noto Peninsula to simulate the underlying pore pressure over the last 11 years in response to seasonal changes in precipitation. They fed into the model meteorological data from this same period, including measurements of daily snow, rainfall, and sea-level changes. From their model, they were able to track changes in excess pore pressure beneath the Noto Peninsula, before and during the earthquake swarm. They then compared this timeline of evolving pore pressure with their evolving picture of seismic velocity.\n\n\"We had seismic velocity observations, and we had the model of excess pore pressure, and when we overlapped them, we saw they just fit extremely well,\" Frank says.\n\nIn particular, they found that when they included snowfall data, and especially, extreme snowfall events, the fit between the model and observations was stronger than if they only considered rainfall and other events. In other words, the ongoing earthquake swarm that Noto residents have been experiencing can be explained in part by seasonal precipitation, and particularly, heavy snowfall events.\n\n\"We can see that the timing of these earthquakes lines up extremely well with multiple times where we see intense snowfall,\" Frank says. \"It's well-correlated with earthquake activity. And we think there's a physical link between the two.\"\n\nThe researchers suspect that heavy snowfall and similar extreme precipitation could play a role in earthquakes elsewhere, though they emphasize that the primary trigger will always originate underground.\n\n\"When we first want to understand how earthquakes work, we look to plate tectonics, because that is and will always be the number one reason why an earthquake happens,\" Frank says. \"But, what are the other things that could affect when and how an earthquake happens?

These tremors, originating from depths of up to 15 kilometers, have left scientists scratching their heads about the cause of this unusual seismic activity. Now, a team of researchers led by Qing-Yu Wang from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has proposed a surprising culprit: heavy rainfall and snowfall.\n\nAt first glance, the idea that the weather could influence earthquakes may seem far-fetched. After all, earthquakes are typically associated with the movement of tectonic plates and the buildup of stress in the Earth's crust. However, the study, published in Science Advances, offers compelling evidence that suggests the weight of water from rain and snow could be the straw that breaks the camel's back, tipping the delicate balance of stress in the subsurface and triggering earthquakes.\n\nThe team arrived at this startling conclusion after analyzing over a decade's worth of seismic data from beneath the Noto Peninsula. By carefully measuring the speed of seismic waves traveling through the Earth's crust, they were able to detect subtle changes in the properties of the rock over time. Surprisingly, they found that the seismic waves consistently slowed down during the winter months and sped back up in the summer.\n\nIntrigued by this seasonal pattern, the researchers set out to investigate whether it could be related to the weight of snow and rain pressing down on the land surface. To test this hypothesis, they created a sophisticated 3D computer model that simulated how the pressure of fluids in the pores and fractures of the rock would change in response to these seasonal environmental forces.\n\nThe model revealed a striking correlation: the seismic waves were indeed highly sensitive to changes in pore pressure, slowing down as the pressure increased each winter under the weight of heavy snow and rainfall. This finding suggests that the often-overlooked influence of surface processes like precipitation could play a significant role in triggering earthquakes.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. The researchers also noticed a puzzling long-term trend in the seismic data: in the years leading up to the earthquake swarm, the seismic waves were gradually speeding up, suggesting that the rocks were becoming increasingly compressed. Then, just before the swarm began in late 2020, the wave speeds suddenly decreased.\n\nTo unravel this mystery, the team turned to GPS data, which can detect minute movements of the land surface. They found that the period of increasing seismic wave speeds corresponded with a subtle sinking of the ground surface, while the abrupt slowdown in late 2020 matched up with a distinct uplift.\n\nThe researchers propose that these changes in ground level and seismic wave speed could be caused by the movement of fluids deep within the crust. They suggest that in the years before the swarm, fluids were gradually draining away from the region, allowing the rock to compact and the ground to subside. But in late 2020, something triggered an influx of high-pressure fluids, possibly from a deeper reservoir, causing the rock to expand and the ground to uplift.\n\nRemarkably, the heavy snowfall in the winter of 2020 may have been the trigger that unleashed this chain of events. The researchers believe that the additional weight of the snow increased the pore pressure in the subsurface just enough to destabilize the delicate balance of stress on deep faults, allowing high-pressure fluids to infiltrate and ultimately triggering the earthquake swarm.\n\nThis groundbreaking study paints a fascinating picture of the complex web of factors that can influence earthquake activity, from the weight of rain and snow on the surface to the movement of fluids kilometers underground. It also raises intriguing questions about the potential impact of climate change on seismic hazards.

As centuries of seismic studies have made clear, it's the collision of tectonic plates and the movement of subsurface faults and fissures that primarily trigger a temblor.\n\nBut MIT scientists have now found that certain weather events may also play a role in setting off some quakes.\n\nIn a study appearing today in Science Advances, the researchers report that episodes of heavy snowfall and rain likely contributed to a swarm of earthquakes over the past several years in northern Japan. The study is the first to show that climate conditions could initiate some quakes.\n\n\"We see that snowfall and other environmental loading at the surface impacts the stress state underground, and the timing of intense precipitation events is well-correlated with the start of this earthquake swarm,\" says study author William Frank, an assistant professor in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). \"So, climate obviously has an impact on the response of the solid earth, and part of that response is earthquakes.\"\n\nThe new study focuses on a series of ongoing earthquakes in Japan's Noto Peninsula. The team discovered that seismic activity in the region is surprisingly synchronized with certain changes in underground pressure, and that those changes are influenced by seasonal patterns of snowfall and precipitation. The scientists suspect that this new connection between quakes and climate may not be unique to Japan and could play a role in shaking up other parts of the world.\n\nLooking to the future, they predict that the climate's influence on earthquakes could be more pronounced with global warming.\n\n\"If we're going into a climate that's changing, with more extreme precipitation events, and we expect a redistribution of water in the atmosphere, oceans, and continents, that will change how the Earth's crust is loaded,\" Frank adds. \"That will have an impact for sure, and it's a link we could further explore.\"\n\nThe study's lead author is former MIT research associate Qing-Yu Wang (now at Grenoble Alpes University), and also includes EAPS postdoc Xin Cui, Yang Lu of the University of Vienna, Takashi Hirose of Tohoku University, and Kazushige Obara of the University of Tokyo.\n\nSince late 2020, hundreds of small earthquakes have shaken up Japan's Noto Peninsula -- a finger of land that curves north from the country's main island into the Sea of Japan. Unlike a typical earthquake sequence, which begins as a main shock that gives way to a series of aftershocks before dying out, Noto's seismic activity is an \"earthquake swarm\" -- a pattern of multiple, ongoing quakes with no obvious main shock, or seismic trigger.\n\nThe MIT team, along with their colleagues in Japan, aimed to spot any patterns in the swarm that would explain the persistent quakes. They started by looking through the Japanese Meteorological Agency's catalog of earthquakes that provides data on seismic activity throughout the country over time. They focused on quakes in the Noto Peninsula over the last 11 years, during which the region has experienced episodic earthquake activity, including the most recent swarm.\n\nWith seismic data from the catalog, the team counted the number of seismic events that occurred in the region over time, and found that the timing of quakes prior to 2020 appeared sporadic and unrelated, compared to late 2020, when earthquakes grew more intense and clustered in time, signaling the start of the swarm, with quakes that are correlated in some way.\n\nThe scientists then looked to a second dataset of seismic measurements taken by monitoring stations over the same 11-year period. Each station continuously records any displacement, or local shaking that occurs. The shaking from one station to another can give scientists an idea of how fast a seismic wave travels between stations. This \"seismic velocity\" is related to the structure of the Earth through which the seismic wave is traveling. Wang used the station measurements to calculate the seismic velocity between every station in and around Noto over the last 11 years.\n\nThe researchers generated an evolving picture of seismic velocity beneath the Noto Peninsula and observed a surprising pattern: In 2020, around when the earthquake swarm is thought to have begun, changes in seismic velocity appeared to be synchronized with the seasons.\n\n\"We then had to explain why we were observing this seasonal variation,\" Frank says.\n\nThe team wondered whether environmental changes from season to season could influence the underlying structure of the Earth in a way that would set off an earthquake swarm. Specifically, they looked at how seasonal precipitation would affect the underground \"pore fluid pressure\" -- the amount of pressure that fluids in the Earth's cracks and fissures exert within the bedrock.\n\n\"When it rains or snows, that adds weight, which increases pore pressure, which allows seismic waves to travel through slower,\" Frank explains. \"When all that weight is removed, through evaporation or runoff, all of a sudden, that pore pressure decreases and seismic waves are faster.\"\n\nWang and Cui developed a hydromechanical model of the Noto Peninsula to simulate the underlying pore pressure over the last 11 years in response to seasonal changes in precipitation. They fed into the model meteorological data from this same period, including measurements of daily snow, rainfall, and sea-level changes. From their model, they were able to track changes in excess pore pressure beneath the Noto Peninsula, before and during the earthquake swarm. They then compared this timeline of evolving pore pressure with their evolving picture of seismic velocity.\n\n\"We had seismic velocity observations, and we had the model of excess pore pressure, and when we overlapped them, we saw they just fit extremely well,\" Frank says.\n\nIn particular, they found that when they included snowfall data, and especially, extreme snowfall events, the fit between the model and observations was stronger than if they only considered rainfall and other events. In other words, the ongoing earthquake swarm that Noto residents have been experiencing can be explained in part by seasonal precipitation, and particularly, heavy snowfall events.\n\n\"We can see that the timing of these earthquakes lines up extremely well with multiple times where we see intense snowfall,\" Frank says. \"It's well-correlated with earthquake activity. And we think there's a physical link between the two.\"\n\nThe researchers suspect that heavy snowfall and similar extreme precipitation could play a role in earthquakes elsewhere, though they emphasize that the primary trigger will always originate underground.\n\n\"When we first want to understand how earthquakes work, we look to plate tectonics, because that is and will always be the number one reason why an earthquake happens,\" Frank says. \"But, what are the other things that could affect when and how an earthquake happens? That's when you start to go to second-order controlling factors, and the climate is obviously one of those.\"", "source": {"uri": "technologynetworks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Technology Networks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noto_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noto Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seismic wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_swarm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake swarm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Precipitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Advances", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science Advances"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pore_water_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pore water pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fissure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stress (mechanics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fault (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plate tectonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_crust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth's crust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tohoku_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tohoku University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan Meteorological Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Vienna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tokyo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Tokyo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reflection seismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aftershock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://assets.technologynetworks.com/production/dynamic/images/content/386591/heavy-snowfall-may-contribute-to-some-earthquakes-386591-640x360.jpg?cb=20240509", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552591", "eventUri": "eng-9552591", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

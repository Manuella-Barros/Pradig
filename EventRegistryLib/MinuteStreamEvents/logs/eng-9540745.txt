The stakes are high for the third and final orbital flight test for Starliner, as it's the first with a crew on board.\n\nJust like Elon Musk's SpaceX capsule, Starliner is intended to be a vehicle that can ferry astronauts to and from the space station as NASA pivots to more partnerships with private industry. But Boeing has largely lagged behind its competitor, which launched its first crewed mission in 2020, according to Reuters.\n\nHere's what to know about Monday's scheduled launched and how to watch it live.\n\nChina launches lunar probe:Mission is to get samples from far side of moon\n\nWhat to know about the Boeing Starliner, crew\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the ISS.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying the commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are Navy test pilots who have flown in space twice, according to Florida Today, a USA TODAY Network publication.\n\nThe astronauts will be in space for a little more than a week testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems. After the mission, the pair will board the Starliner for a return trip to Earth and a parachute and airbag landing in the American Southwest.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone,\" NASA Associate Administrator James Free told reporters during a recent flight readiness review, according to Florida Today. \"The lives of our crew members, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all.\"\n\nHow to watch the Boeing Starliner launch\n\nBoeing and NASA are targeting 10:34 p.m. ET on Monday for Starliner's launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The capsule will fly to space on top of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nExpect more coverage when the Starliner is expected to dock to the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module at 12:46 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nWhat went wrong on past Boeing tests\n\nDozens of software and engineering issues resulted in the failure of a previous attempt in 2019 to send an uncrewed Starliner to the ISS for a week.\n\nWhile it reached orbit, the capsule failed to reach the space station and instead returned to Earth, according to Florida Today. That mission raised questions and doubts about NASA's future with Boeing, which is scheduled to fly six crewed astronaut missions once it's certified as safe for flight, Reuters reported.\n\nThe follow up flight test in 2022 met standards of docking to the space station and successfully landed, but not without the discovery of multiple issues as Boeing crews inspected the spacecraft later on, Florida Today reported.\n\nEngineers have expressed a high level of confidence about the upcoming launch, the outlet reported.\n\n\"Our process in human spaceflight is very robust. We design around redundancy,\" Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Starliner program, said during a March NASA news conference. \"We test, test, and test.\"\n\nNASA paid Boeing, SpaceX to develop spacecraft\n\nBoeing was selected along with SpaceX to provide spacecrafts that would transport astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit for NASA.\n\nBoeing's contract with the U.S. space agency awarded in 2014 was good for $4.8 billion, while SpaceX received $3.1 billion, according to Florida Today.\n\nThe partnership is part of NASA's\u202fcommercial crew program\u202fin which the space agency is paying private companies to build spacecraft capable of ferrying trained astronauts to the space station for scientific missions.

The stakes are high for the third and final orbital flight test for Starliner, as it's the first with a crew on board.\n\nJust like Elon Musk's SpaceX capsule, Starliner is intended to be a vehicle that can ferry astronauts to and from the space station as NASA pivots to more partnerships with private industry. But Boeing has largely lagged behind its competitor, which launched its first crewed mission in 2020, according to Reuters.\n\nHere's what to know about Monday's scheduled launched and how to watch it live.\n\nChina launches lunar probe: Mission is to get samples from far side of moon\n\nWhat to know about the Boeing Starliner, crew\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the ISS.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying the commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are Navy test pilots who have flown in space twice, according to Florida Today, a USA TODAY Network publication.\n\nThe astronauts will be in space for a little more than a week testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems. After the mission, the pair will board the Starliner for a return trip to Earth and a parachute and airbag landing in the American Southwest.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone,\" NASA Associate Administrator James Free told reporters during a recent flight readiness review, according to Florida Today. \"The lives of our crew members, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all.\"\n\nHow to watch the Boeing Starliner launch\n\nBoeing and NASA are targeting 10:34 p.m. ET on Monday for Starliner's launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The capsule will fly to space on top of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nExpect more coverage when the Starliner is expected to dock to the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module at 12:46 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nWhat went wrong on past Boeing tests\n\nDozens of software and engineering issues resulted in the failure of a previous attempt in 2019 to send an uncrewed Starliner to the ISS for a week.\n\nWhile it reached orbit, the capsule failed to reach the space station and instead returned to Earth, according to Florida Today. That mission raised questions and doubts about NASA's future with Boeing, which is scheduled to fly six crewed astronaut missions once it's certified as safe for flight, Reuters reported.\n\nThe follow up flight test in 2022 met standards of docking to the space station and successfully landed, but not without the discovery of multiple issues as Boeing crews inspected the spacecraft later on, Florida Today reported.\n\nEngineers have expressed a high level of confidence about the upcoming launch, the outlet reported.\n\n\"Our process in human spaceflight is very robust. We design around redundancy,\" Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Starliner program, said during a March NASA news conference. \"We test, test, and test.\"\n\nNASA paid Boeing, SpaceX to develop spacecraft\n\nBoeing was selected along with SpaceX to provide spacecrafts that would transport astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit for NASA.\n\nBoeing's contract with the U.S. space agency awarded in 2014 was good for $4.8 billion, while SpaceX received $3.1 billion, according to Florida Today.\n\nThe partnership is part of NASA's\u202fcommercial crew program\u202fin which the space agency is paying private companies to build spacecraft capable of ferrying trained astronauts to the space station for scientific missions. Under NASA's more ambitious Artemis lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the moon and eventually Mars.\n\nIn March, SpaceX had its most successful test yet of the Starship rocket needed for NASA's Artemis missions. While in orbit, the Starship hit several key milestones and conducted a handful of in-flight tests that are a crucial step forward for it to be reliable and functional.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station.

The CST-100 Starliner with two astronauts aboard was due for liftoff at 10:34 p.m. (0234 GMT on Tuesday) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carried atop an Atlas V rocket furnished by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew are headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), two years after the Starliner completed its first test voyage to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. Boeing, whose commercial plane operations are in disarray after several sequential crises, badly needs a space win for its Starliner venture, a years-delayed program with more than $1 billion in cost overruns.\n\nWhile Boeing has struggled, SpaceX has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA, which is backing a new generation of privately built spacecraft that can ferry its astronauts and other customers to the ISS and, under the space agency's more ambitious Artemis program, to the moon and eventually Mars. Starliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nRiding aboard the Starliner, designed to carry up to seven crew members, are veteran NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain, and Sunita \"Sunni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy aviator and test pilot. They have logged a combined 500 days in space over the course of two missions each to the space station. Wilmore is the designated commander for Monday's flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually. WEATHER FORECASTS FAVORABLE\n\nLaunch forecasts on Monday called for a 95% chance of favorable weather conditions, and ULA said on social media that \"all systems remain 'go'\" for an on-time liftoff. The launch would mark the first crewed voyage to space using an Atlas rocket since the storied family of Atlas launch vehicles first sent astronauts, including John Glenn, on orbital flights for NASA's Mercury program in the 1960s.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the space station after a flight of about 26 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth early on Wednesday. Wilmore and Williams are expected to remain at the space station for about a week before riding the Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for crewed NASA missions.\n\nThe test flight comes at an especially critical moment for Boeing. Its airplane business is dealing with fallout from a midair blowout of a cabin panel door plug on a nearly new 737 MAX 9 in January, as well as previous deadly crashes of two 737 MAX jets. Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing, beset by years of development setbacks and more than $1.5 billion in charges for the aerospace giant on a $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA.\n\nThe space agency wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, which is expected to retire around 2030. NASA is encouraging private development of new space stations that could replace the ISS after its retirement, potentially giving Starliner new destinations. The first attempt by Boeing to send an uncrewed Starliner to the space station in 2019 failed due to dozens of software and engineering glitches.

Meanwhile, Boeing's rival under NASA's commercial crew program - SpaceX - has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency's astronauts.\n\nNow, NASA and Boeing have finally deemed the Starliner spacecraft ready for its ultimate test: allowing astronauts to test-drive the vehicle in outer space.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be on board Monday's mission, riding Starliner to the International Space Station for a weeklong stay.\n\nThroughout their flight, Wilmore and Williams will conduct a series of tests, including briefly taking over the controls of the autonomous spacecraft and evaluating how the vehicle operates for astronauts.\n\nA smooth flight could be a winning moment for Boeing's spaceflight program and the company overall, which has been in the hotseat due to issues with its commercial airplane division.\n\nHere's what to know about Starliner's journey before its historic crewed test flight.\n\nOfficials at Boeing have sought to make clear that Starliner operates separately from the sector at the company responsible for commercial aircraft. And the Starliner team's primary interest is in ensuring a smooth test mission and crew safety, according to Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner program manager at Boeing.\n\n\"We have humans flying on this vehicle. We always take that so seriously,\" Nappi said during a news briefing last week. \"I spent my career in this business, and it always has been the top of the list.\"\n\nThe two Starliner astronauts have waited years for the spacecraft to be deemed ready to carry crew. After several astronauts rotated in and out of assignments on Starliner's Crew Flight Test, Wilmore received his appointment in 2020. NASA moved Williams onto this flight in 2022 after initially assigning her in 2018 to a later Starliner mission.\n\n\"We've had a couple (of) launch dates, and we've been like, 'OK, we're ready to go,'\" Williams said at a Wednesday news conference. \"But now it's like, heck - five days. It is actually, finally real, and I sort of have to pinch myself a little bit to understand, actually, we're going.\"\n\nRELATED: Ever wanted to be an astronaut? NASA is now accepting applications for Artemis moon mission\n\nAt a news briefing last month, Steve Stich, the program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said that NASA required Boeing and SpaceX to meet a certain threshold regarding the risk the mission would result in the death of astronauts - 1 in 270.\n\n\"Boeing exceeds that number with a 1 in 295 loss of crew number,\" he said.\n\nBoeing received a NASA contract to build Starliner in 2014 at the same time the space agency selected SpaceX to build its Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nNASA gave the companies deals worth up to $6.8 billion combined, hoping that Boeing and SpaceX would both have their capsules ready to fly as soon as 2017.\n\nThat expectation didn't pan out.\n\nSpaceX took longer than planned, flying the inaugural astronaut launch of its Crew Dragon capsule in the summer of 2020. It has since completed 13 missions to orbit for NASA astronauts and paying customers.\n\nBut Boeing - despite NASA officials initially believing the Starliner would be ready before SpaceX's Crew Dragon - faced years of additional delays, setbacks and added expenses that have cost the company more than $1 billion, according to public financial records.\n\nNotably, the first Starliner test mission, flown without crew in late 2019, was riddled with missteps. The vehicle misfired in orbit, a symptom of software problems that included a coding error that set an internal clock off by 11 hours.\n\nA second uncrewed flight test in 2022 uncovered additional software issues and trouble with some of the vehicle's thrusters.\n\nThose hang-ups delayed the inaugural crewed flight into 2023. But then a new slate of problems arose - the spacecraft's parachutes had some components that were weaker than expected, and tape in the vehicle was found to be flammable.\n\nBoeing then had to remove more than a mile's worth of that tape and complete additional tests of the parachutes.\n\nFinally, after a decade of development, NASA and Boeing have cleared the vehicle to fly astronauts.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have taken a measured approach when responding to questions about the Starliner spacecraft's development woes.\n\n\"I understand it when you say 'setback,'\" Wilmore said during the recent news conference. \"But honestly, with all the discovery - that's what we would term it - that we've had, it's been steps forward.\n\n\"It's not been a setback, it's been pressing forward,\" he said. \"And our families have lived that with us.\"\n\nWilliams added that she is prepared to go into Monday's mission with the expectation that small issues may arise.\n\n\"We always find stuff, and we are going to continually find stuff,\" she said Wednesday. \"Everything's not going to be absolutely perfect as we fly the spacecraft. And that's really what our goal is. We've got it to a point - all of us, big team - got it to a point that we feel very safe and comfortable with how this spacecraft flies, and we have backup procedures in case we need those.\"\n\n\"We're here,\" Williams said, \"because we're ready.\"", "source": {"uri": "6abc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "6abc Action News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outer space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14772981_050624-wpvi-boeing-starlink-launch-preview-430a-vo-video-vid.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Wilmore is the designated commander for Monday's flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually.\n\nWEATHER FORECASTS FAVORABLE\n\nLaunch forecasts on Monday called for a 95% chance of favorable weather conditions, and ULA said on social media that \"all systems remain 'go'\" for an on-time liftoff.\n\nThe launch would mark the first crewed voyage to space using an Atlas rocket since the storied family of Atlas launch vehicles first sent astronauts, including John Glenn, on orbital flights for NASA's Mercury program in the 1960s.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the space station after a flight of about 26 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth early on Wednesday.\n\nWilmore and Williams are expected to remain at the space station for about a week before riding the Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for crewed NASA missions.\n\nThe test flight comes at an especially critical moment for Boeing. Its airplane business is dealing with fallout from a midair blowout of a cabin panel door plug on a nearly new 737 MAX 9 in January, as well as previous deadly crashes of two 737 MAX jets.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing, beset by years of development setbacks and more than $1.5 billion in charges for the aerospace giant on a $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA.\n\nThe space agency wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, which is expected to retire around 2030. NASA is encouraging private development of new space stations that could replace the ISS after its retirement, potentially giving Starliner new destinations.\n\nThe first attempt by Boeing to send an uncrewed Starliner to the space station in 2019 failed due to dozens of software and engineering glitches. A second attempt in 2022 succeeded, paving the way for Monday night's mission.\n\nDepending on the outcome, Starliner is booked to fly at least six more crewed missions to the space station for NASA.\n\nAt a pre-flight briefing with NASA officials on Friday, Boeing vice president Mark Nappi said the company and the space agency were \"in total agreement\" that the Starliner was ready to fly with crew, adding, \"we can't be more confident.\"\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson said. \"That's why we put two test pilots on board.\"\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Sam Holmes and Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The stakes are high for the third and final orbital flight test for Starliner, as it's the first with a crew on board.\n\nJust like Elon Musk's SpaceX capsule, Starliner is intended to be a vehicle that can ferry astronauts to and from the space station as NASA pivots to more partnerships with private industry. But Boeing has largely lagged behind its competitor, which launched its first crewed mission in 2020, according to Reuters.\n\nHere's what to know about Monday's scheduled launched and how to watch it live.\n\nChina launches lunar probe: Mission is to get samples from far side of moon\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the ISS.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying the commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are Navy test pilots who have flown in space twice, according to Florida Today, a USA TODAY Network publication.\n\nThe astronauts will be in space for a little more than a week testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems. After the mission, the pair will board the Starliner for a return trip to Earth and a parachute and airbag landing in the American Southwest.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone,\" NASA Associate Administrator James Free told reporters during a recent flight readiness review, according to Florida Today. \"The lives of our crew members, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all.\"\n\nBoeing and NASA are targeting 10:34 p.m. ET on Monday for Starliner's launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The capsule will fly to space on top of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nExpect more coverage when the Starliner is expected to dock to the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module at 12:46 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nDozens of software and engineering issues resulted in the failure of a previous attempt in 2019 to send an uncrewed Starliner to the ISS for a week.\n\nWhile it reached orbit, the capsule failed to reach the space station and instead returned to Earth, according to Florida Today. That mission raised questions and doubts about NASA's future with Boeing, which is scheduled to fly six crewed astronaut missions once it's certified as safe for flight, Reuters reported.\n\nThe follow up flight test in 2022 met standards of docking to the space station and successfully landed, but not without the discovery of multiple issues as Boeing crews inspected the spacecraft later on, Florida Today reported.\n\nEngineers have expressed a high level of confidence about the upcoming launch, the outlet reported.\n\n\"Our process in human spaceflight is very robust. We design around redundancy,\" Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Starliner program, said during a March NASA news conference. \"We test, test, and test.\"\n\nBoeing was selected along with SpaceX to provide spacecrafts that would transport astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit for NASA.\n\nBoeing's contract with the U.S. space agency awarded in 2014 was good for $4.8 billion, while SpaceX received $3.1 billion, according to Florida Today.\n\nThe partnership is part of NASA's commercial crew program in which the space agency is paying private companies to build spacecraft capable of ferrying trained astronauts to the space station for scientific missions. Under NASA's more ambitious Artemis lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the moon and eventually Mars.\n\nIn March, SpaceX had its most successful test yet of the Starship rocket needed for NASA's Artemis missions. While in orbit, the Starship hit several key milestones and conducted a handful of in-flight tests that are a crucial step forward for it to be reliable and functional.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched March 3 and docked March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nIf the mission is a success, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to NASA.\n\nContributing: Brooke Edwards, Florida Today\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nTwo NASA astronauts have reached the final hours before a long-awaited launch attempt aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule, marking the first crewed mission of the brand-new spacecraft.\n\nStarliner -- which the aerospace giant designed to rival SpaceX's prolific Crew Dragon capsule -- is set to take off for its inaugural crewed test run at 10:34 p.m. ET Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nNASA will webcast the event on its channels beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET Monday. CNN will carry live updates of the mission online shortly before liftoff.\n\nWeather or technical issues can always force a rocket launch to scrub all the way up until the countdown clock strikes zero, but the forecast for this evening is as good as it gets. Weather officials have said there's only a 5% chance that clouds, winds or storms will interrupt tonight's takeoff.\n\nThis mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing's spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency's Commercial Crew Program. The Starliner would join SpaceX's Crew Dragon in NASA's push to collaborate with private industry partners, expanding the United States' options for ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nThe mission crew members are veteran astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, each of whom has ventured to space on two previous journeys aboard NASA space shuttle and Russian Soyuz missions.\n\nNASA astronauts Suni Williams (left) Butch Wilmore pose after they arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on April 25, in Cape Canaveral, Florida, ahead of the Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test. Terry Renna/AP\n\n\"They're checking out a lot of the systems: the life support, the manual control,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during a Friday news conference. \"That's why we put two test pilots on board -- and of course the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of Butch and Suni are extensive.\"\n\nWhat to expect\n\nIf all goes to plan, the crew will board the Starliner capsule and lift off atop an Atlas V rocket Monday night. The spacecraft -- carrying the astronauts -- will break away from the rocket after reaching orbit and begin firing its own engines. The Starliner will then spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station, where the vehicle is expected to dock at 12:46 a.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week aboard the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside.\n\nThe two will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.\n\nBoeing vs. SpaceX\n\nMuch is riding on a smooth test flight. NASA has been waiting half a decade for Starliner to begin flying crew, and the development of Starliner was beset by years of delays, setbacks and blunders. More broadly, Boeing as a company has suffered years of scandals in its aircraft division that have tarnished the legacy aerospace giant's brand.\n\n\"We got through a pretty rigorous process to get here,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner program manager at Boeing, of the development process during the Friday briefing. \"And really where my source of confidence comes from is going through that process.\"\n\nIf successful, the Crew Test Flight could queue up Boeing to begin flying routine trips to the space station on NASA's behalf.\n\nThe US space agency selected Boeing to develop Starliner -- alongside SpaceX and its Crew Dragon capsule -- in 2014, hoping the commercial companies could create complementary new means of ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station after the space shuttle program retired in 2011.\n\nSpaceX ultimately beat Boeing to the launchpad, carrying out its crewed flight test of the Crew Dragon capsule in May 2020. SpaceX has handled most of NASA's crew transportation needs since then.\n\n\"We cheer for SpaceX. That's something that is very important to our country and very important to NASA to have that access.\" Nappi said during a March news briefing. \"And we're looking forward to providing (astronaut transportation services) as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackie_wattles@cnn.com", "name": "Jackie Wattles", "type": "author",

Boeing's Starliner is set to launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida, marking its inaugural crewed test flight.Boeing is finally ready to send two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) for the first time aboard its Starliner space capsule. The CST-100 Starliner test mission scheduled for Monday night is years in the making and serves as a final demonstration before the spacecraft can be approved for routine trips to orbit. The stakes are high for the third and final orbital flight test for Starliner, as it's the first with a crew on board.\n\nSimilar to SpaceX's Dragon capsule, Starliner is part of NASA's strategy to foster collaborations with private industry for space exploration. However, Boeing has faced setbacks compared to its competitors, notably SpaceX, which achieved its first crewed mission in 2020.\n\nAs per a report by USA Today, the upcoming mission will feature two seasoned NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both distinguished Navy test pilots, Wilmore and Williams boast extensive spaceflight experience, with multiple missions under their belts. With Wilmore's combat expertise and Williams' diverse flight background, the duo is primed to undertake a little over a week of testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems in orbit.\n\nScheduled for 10:34 p.m. ET on Monday, the Boeing Starliner launch will unfold from Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop an Atlas V rocket. NASA will provide live coverage starting at 6:30 p.m. on various platforms, including NASA+, NASA Television, the agency's official app, YouTube page, and website. A post-launch news conference is also on the agenda, offering viewers real-time insights into this historic moment.\n\nDespite past setbacks, Boeing remains optimistic, emphasizing the rigorous testing regimen and commitment to safety in human spaceflight endeavors.\n\nWhy is Starliner taking so long?\n\nEngineers eventually identified moisture intrusion and corrosion as the root cause of the problem, leading to another lengthy delay. However, the second Starliner test flight in May 2022 was a success, docking at the space station as planned and returning to Earth with a pinpoint landing.\n\nHow much did Boeing get for Starliner?\n\nBoeing received over $4 billion in federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about $2.6 billion. The Starliner is set to be launched atop the iconic Atlas V rocket, marking the first time a manned flight will utilize the Atlas V since the Mercury space flights of the 1960s, including John Glenn's famous first orbit in 1962.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109890553,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-78336,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Boeing's rival under NASA's commercial crew program -- SpaceX -- has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency's astronauts.\n\nNow, NASA and Boeing have finally deemed the Starliner spacecraft ready for its ultimate test: allowing astronauts to test-drive the vehicle in outer space.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be on board Monday's mission, riding Starliner to the International Space Station for a weeklong stay.\n\nThroughout their flight, Wilmore and Williams will conduct a series of tests, including briefly taking over the controls of the autonomous spacecraft and evaluating how the vehicle operates for astronauts.\n\nA smooth flight could be a winning moment for Boeing's spaceflight program and the company overall, which has been in the hotseat due to issues with its commercial airplane division.\n\nHere's what to know about Starliner's journey before its historic crewed test flight.\n\nOfficials at Boeing have sought to make clear that Starliner operates separately from the sector at the company responsible for commercial aircraft. And the Starliner team's primary interest is in ensuring a smooth test mission and crew safety, according to Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner program manager at Boeing.\n\n\"We have humans flying on this vehicle. We always take that so seriously,\" Nappi said during a news briefing last week. \"I spent my career in this business, and it always has been the top of the list.\"\n\nThe two Starliner astronauts have waited years for the spacecraft to be deemed ready to carry crew. After several astronauts rotated in and out of assignments on Starliner's Crew Flight Test, Wilmore received his appointment in 2020. NASA moved Williams onto this flight in 2022 after initially assigning her in 2018 to a later Starliner mission.\n\n\"We've had a couple (of) launch dates, and we've been like, 'OK, we're ready to go,'\" Williams said at a Wednesday news conference. \"But now it's like, heck -- five days. It is actually, finally real, and I sort of have to pinch myself a little bit to understand, actually, we're going.\"\n\nAt a news briefing last month, Steve Stich, the program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said that NASA required Boeing and SpaceX to meet a certain threshold regarding the risk the mission would result in the death of astronauts -- 1 in 270.\n\n\"Boeing exceeds that number with a 1 in 295 loss of crew number,\" he said.\n\nBoeing received a NASA contract to build Starliner in 2014 at the same time the space agency selected SpaceX to build its Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nNASA gave the companies deals worth up to $6.8 billion combined, hoping that Boeing and SpaceX would both have their capsules ready to fly as soon as 2017.\n\nThat expectation didn't pan out.\n\nSpaceX took longer than planned, flying the inaugural astronaut launch of its Crew Dragon capsule in the summer of 2020. It has since completed 13 missions to orbit for NASA astronauts and paying customers.\n\nBut Boeing -- despite NASA officials initially believing the Starliner would be ready before SpaceX's Crew Dragon -- faced years of additional delays, setbacks and added expenses that have cost the company more than $1 billion, according to public financial records.\n\nNotably, the first Starliner test mission, flown without crew in late 2019, was riddled with missteps. The vehicle misfired in orbit, a symptom of software problems that included a coding error that set an internal clock off by 11 hours.\n\nA second uncrewed flight test in 2022 uncovered additional software issues and trouble with some of the vehicle's thrusters.\n\nThose hang-ups delayed the inaugural crewed flight into 2023. But then a new slate of problems arose -- the spacecraft's parachutes had some components that were weaker than expected, and tape in the vehicle was found to be flammable.\n\nBoeing then had to remove more than a mile's worth of that tape and complete additional tests of the parachutes.\n\nFinally, after a decade of development, NASA and Boeing have cleared the vehicle to fly astronauts.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have taken a measured approach when responding to questions about the Starliner spacecraft's development woes.\n\n\"I understand it when you say 'setback,'\" Wilmore said during the recent news conference. \"But honestly, with all the discovery -- that's what we would term it -- that we've had, it's been steps forward.\n\n\"It's not been a setback, it's been pressing forward,\" he said. \"And our families have lived that with us.\"\n\nWilliams added that she is prepared to go into Monday's mission with the expectation that small issues may arise.\n\n\"We always find stuff, and we are going to continually find stuff,\" she said Wednesday. \"Everything's not going to be absolutely perfect as we fly the spacecraft. And that's really what our goal is. We've got it to a point -- all of us, big team -- got it to a point that we feel very safe and comfortable with how this spacecraft flies, and we have backup procedures in case we need those.\"\n\n\"We're here,\" Williams said, \"because we're ready.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The first time an Atlas V rocket has lifted astronauts into space. The first launch of humans from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Launch Complex 41.\n\nBut on a day of firsts, there is one thing that's not: the two NASA astronauts flying Starliner to the International Space Station bring with them extensive experience in space and at the orbiting outpost. Astronaut Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, the Starliner pilot, described the mission last week as \"feeling like going home.\"\n\nWilliams and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore , the mission commander, share Navy test pilot backgrounds and both have flown on two NASA missions to the station. Both have been training years for this flight, as they waited through multiple delays. The Starliner, like SpaceX's Dragon, is being contracted by NASA to ferry crews to-and-from the ISS.\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention ... they are checking out a lot of the systems, the life support, the manual control, all of those things that you want to be checked out,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at a Friday news conference. \"That's why we put two test pilots onboard.\"\n\nThe Starliner capsule is set to launch atop the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on the Crewed Flight Test mission at 10:34 p.m. Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Launch Complex 41. The early weather outlook appears good with a 95 percent chance of acceptable conditions for launch.\n\n\"We're at peak performance right now and we're really looking forward to executing this weekend, executing the launch and executing the mission in the same way that we got here,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager for Boeing's Starliner program. \"We're ready to go.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the mission.\n\nDon't miss the next rocket launch: Is there a launch today? Upcoming rocket launch schedule for SpaceX, ULA, NASA in Florida\n\nStarliner will launch from Space Force Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe pad has been the launch site for historic missions beginning with the Titan rockets in 1965. Other notable missions include the New Horizons deep space probe, the Voyager spacecraft and even the Curiosity Mars rover.\n\nWhat has never happened from the pad before: the launch of humans. The Atlas V rocket has launched from the site since 2002, but this will be the first time it carries astronauts to space.\n\nTo prepare for this mission, the launch complex recently saw the addition of a crew access arm.\n\nAnother interesting note: the last crewed launch from this military side of the Cape occurred in 1968 with the launch of Apollo 7. All other crewed launches since have taken place from Kennedy Space Center.\n\nAlso, this will be only the sixth time in history NASA astronauts have flown a new spacecraft. These include: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle, Dragon, and now Starliner.\n\nThe day the Starliner spacecraft was finally mated to the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket for the crew flight test was a long time coming for the team at Boeing.\n\nNASA originally awarded Boeing the contract to fly astronauts in 2014, alongside SpaceX. Boeing received $4.8 billion for Starliner while SpaceX received $3.1 billion for Dragon. Both companies were part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which replaced the space shuttle after its retirement in 2011.\n\nBoth were late to deliver, hoping to launch as soon as 2017 and restore NASA astronauts access to space from American soil (NASA astronauts were hitching rides aboard the Russian Soyuz).\n\nFollowing a successful crewed demo flight in 2020, SpaceX has since flown eight NASA crews and multiple private crews to the ISS.\n\nAfter facing multiple setbacks, including issues found after a successful uncrewed docking with the ISS and landing in 2022, Boeing hopes to prove the capability of its Starliner spacecraft to take on its designated role ferrying NASA crews to the station.\n\nOnce successful, Starliner will fly NASA crews in rotation with SpaceX's Dragon- a needed redundancy to ensure NASA access to low Earth orbit.\n\nGoing beyond this test flight, according to Boeing, NASA has already contracted for six crewed missions on Starliner.\n\nNASA astronaut and former NASA Associate Administrator and former KSC Director Bob Cabana told FLORIDA TODAY that the success of Boeing Starliner is essential to ensure NASA always has a way to access the station.\n\n\"We want that dissimilar redundancy,\" said Cabana, adding that NASA cannot rely on solely one company.\n\nWith the commercial crew program charged with ensuring access to low Earth orbit, NASA continues to work on its Artemis program, which will fly a crew around the Moon as soon as late 2025. That will mark the first time humans have returned to the Moon since the Apollo missions ended over five decades ago.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY spoke with Kim Ess, manager of the Integrated Performance Office (IPO) in NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP) at Johnson Space Center. Ess explained that NASA has done demonstration testing alongside Boeing to ensure the safety of the spacecraft.\n\n\"We took more risks when it was just a test flight,\" Ess said on the topic of the second uncrewed flight in 2022. \"Now that our payload, our two crew members, Butch and Suni, we did a lot more research.\"\n\nShe explained that NASA provided Boeing requirements to meet before this crewed flight, and Boeing returned with the necessary results.\n\n\"In many cases, we do an independent verification of those requirements,\" Ess said. She used the example of Boeing demonstrating that they would be able to return the crew safely during a simulation of the landing. NASA ran the same simulation at the organization's Johnson Space Center to compare the data.\n\n\"Any differences, we bring in and we talk with them and see 'okay, did you have an error in your model, or did we have an error in our model, or are these true differences?'\" Ess said.\n\n\"As long as they're along the same lines, we're good. And we have done that extensively for this flight,\" Ess said.\n\nBoeing calls it the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner, or simply \"Starliner\". Like SpaceX's Crew Dragon, it can carry a mix of crew and cargo or up to seven crew memebers.\n\nWith a total height of 16.5 ft (capsule + service module combined) and a diameter of 15 ft, it is a what Boeing refers to as \"a next-generation space capsule.\"\n\nThat ship was remembered for its underwater observation chamber and being equipped with a helicopter and submersibles, assisting in scientific expeditions. Williams mentioned being excited by Cousteau's television show as a young girl and looked forward to watching his expeditions.\n\nAfter gaining a B.S. in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Williams graduated from Florida Tech in 1995 with her M.S. in Engineering Science.\n\nLast year, she gave a commencement speech to the 2023 Florida Tech graduates.\n\nWilliams' first chance to fly to space came when assigned to STS-116. On December 9, 2006, Williams and crew took off onboard Space Shuttle Discovery for a six month stay onboard the ISS.\n\nWilliams returned to the ISS during Expedition 32/33. Launching from Kazakhstan in a Soyuz spacecraft on July 14, 2012, Williams saw another long stay onboard the space station. After that 127-day visit to space, she accumulated a total of 322 days spent off the planet.\n\nNow, she said, she's been waiting a long time for this moment.\n\n\"With each launch that was rescheduled, I've been given perspective I would've never had without those delays,\" Williams said before going on to explain how the crew not only got more time to learn about the spacecraft, but to also help shape the Starliner program.\n\nDuring a preflight NASA Q and A, Wilmore and Williams mentioned the new Astro Van. Unlike SpaceX crews, who ride in a Tesla, Boeing astronauts will ride to the rocket in a new van. This ride to the pad is reminiscence of the shuttle days, during which NASA astronauts rode in a similar van.\n\nOf course, there will be music on the way.\n\nAsked what would be on their playlist, Wilmore quipped \"Epic music.\" Smiling, he added, \"It's in a fight scene in Top Gun Maverick, it's on my playlist.\"\n\nGuardians at the Gate and Freedom Fighters are two songs Wilmore has on his list.\n\nWilliams, however, is going for a more relaxing feeling before launch. \"A bit of Country Western and a little bit of Pop. I got a little bit of Kenney Chesney, a little bit of Zac Brown ready to go,\" she said.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY's Space Team will continue to bring you the latest information on the mission. While the launch is currently set for 10:34 p.m. Monday, various factors can change this.\n\nFollow the FLORIDA TODAY Live Blog on launch day as we await the liftoff of Starliner.\n\nTo received launch alerts and updates, download the free FLORIDA TODAY app and enable push alerts from the app settings.\n\nA night launch is difficult to miss under clear conditions. If you are on the Space Coast, simply look towards the sky above the area south of the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nShould conditions Monday night cause a scrub, the next backup launch opportunity is 10:11 p.m. Tuesday. But so far, weather looks like it will cooperate.\n\nPlans call for Starliner to dock with the station about 26 1/2 hours after launch.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will be busy testing all aspects of Starliner. Being a test flight, demonstrating that the spacecraft preforms as it should will be the crew's main focus.\n\nEss told FLORIDA TODAY that one of the biggest objectives is the crew's ability to take manual control of Starliner. While Starliner is autonomous, there must be the ability to control the spacecraft manually in case of an emergency situation.\n\n\"Prior to docking to the space station ... we're going to approach and then stop, and the crew is going to go through several flight test objectives for manual control and demonstrate that they can do it,\" said Ess.\n\nEss said the crew also will be monitoring the spacecraft's software performance.\n\nOnce Starliner receives certification to fly NASA crews, it will carry a crew of four on Starliner-1. For this reason, Williams and Wilmore stated during a May 1st press briefing that Crew-8, four astronauts who are currently onboard the ISS, will provide assistance in checking out that the spacecraft can comfortably fit a crew of four in space.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore stated that they plan to give Crew-8 the full Starliner tour.\n\nWhile their stay onboard the ISS is expected to be approximately eight days, there remains the possibly of this stay being extended due to various factors, such as weather at the landing site.

Wilmore is the designated commander for Monday's flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually.\n\nWEATHER FORECASTS FAVORABLE\n\nLaunch forecasts on Monday called for a 95% chance of favorable weather conditions, and ULA said on social media that \"all systems remain 'go'\" for an on-time liftoff.\n\nThe launch would mark the first crewed voyage to space using an Atlas rocket since the storied family of Atlas launch vehicles first sent astronauts, including John Glenn, on orbital flights for NASA's Mercury program in the 1960s.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the space station after a flight of about 26 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth early on Wednesday.\n\nWilmore and Williams are expected to remain at the space station for about a week before riding the Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for crewed NASA missions.\n\nThe test flight comes at an especially critical moment for Boeing. Its airplane business is dealing with fallout from a midair blowout of a cabin panel door plug on a nearly new 737 MAX 9 in January, as well as previous deadly crashes of two 737 MAX jets.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing, beset by years of development setbacks and more than $1.5 billion in charges for the aerospace giant on a $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA.\n\nThe space agency wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, which is expected to retire around 2030. NASA is encouraging private development of new space stations that could replace the ISS after its retirement, potentially giving Starliner new destinations.\n\nThe first attempt by Boeing to send an uncrewed Starliner to the space station in 2019 failed due to dozens of software and engineering glitches. A second attempt in 2022 succeeded, paving the way for Monday night's mission.\n\nDepending on the outcome, Starliner is booked to fly at least six more crewed missions to the space station for NASA.\n\nAt a pre-flight briefing with NASA officials on Friday, Boeing vice president Mark Nappi said the company and the space agency were \"in total agreement\" that the Starliner was ready to fly with crew, adding, \"we can't be more confident.\"\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson said. \"That's why we put two test pilots on board.\"\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Sam Holmes and Will Dunham)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nBoeing's spaceflight program may reach a significant milestone Monday night with the launch of its Starliner spacecraft, carrying -- at long last -- two NASA astronauts to orbit.\n\nThe mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could take off as soon as Monday at 10:34 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nLive coverage of the event will stream on NASA channels beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET Monday, according to the space agency.\n\nThe occasion is a decade in the making -- the culmination of Boeing's efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nDevelopment hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner's path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing's rival under NASA's commercial crew program -- SpaceX -- has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency's astronauts.\n\nNow, NASA and Boeing have finally deemed the Starliner spacecraft ready for its ultimate test: allowing astronauts to test-drive the vehicle in outer space.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be on board Monday's mission, riding Starliner to the International Space Station for a weeklong stay.\n\nThroughout their flight, Wilmore and Williams will conduct a series of tests, including briefly taking over the controls of the autonomous spacecraft and evaluating how the vehicle operates for astronauts.\n\nA smooth flight could be a winning moment for Boeing's spaceflight program and the company overall, which has been in the hotseat due to issues with its commercial airplane division.\n\nHere's what to know about Starliner's journey before its historic crewed test flight.\n\nThe human component\n\nOfficials at Boeing have sought to make clear that Starliner operates separately from the sector at the company responsible for commercial aircraft. And the Starliner team's primary interest is in ensuring a smooth test mission and crew safety, according to Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner program manager at Boeing.\n\n\"We have humans flying on this vehicle. We always take that so seriously,\" Nappi said during a news briefing last week. \"I spent my career in this business, and it always has been the top of the list.\"\n\nNASA astronauts Suni Williams, left, and Butch Wilmore pose for a photo after they arrived at Starliner's launch site in Florida on April 25, 2024. Terry Renna/AP\n\nThe two Starliner astronauts have waited years for the spacecraft to be deemed ready to carry crew. After several astronauts rotated in and out of assignments on Starliner's Crew Flight Test, Wilmore received his appointment in 2020. NASA moved Williams onto this flight in 2022 after initially assigning her in 2018 to a later Starliner mission.\n\n\"We've had a couple (of) launch dates, and we've been like, 'OK, we're ready to go,'\" Williams said at a Wednesday news conference. \"But now it's like, heck -- five days. It is actually, finally real, and I sort of have to pinch myself a little bit to understand, actually, we're going.\"\n\nAt a news briefing last month, Steve Stich, the program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said that NASA required Boeing and SpaceX to meet a certain threshold regarding the risk the mission would result in the death of astronauts -- 1 in 270.\n\n\"Boeing exceeds that number with a 1 in 295 loss of crew number,\" he said.\n\nStarliner's rocky path\n\nBoeing received a NASA contract to build Starliner in 2014 at the same time the space agency selected SpaceX to build its Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nNASA gave the companies deals worth up to $6.8 billion combined, hoping that Boeing and SpaceX would both have their capsules ready to fly as soon as 2017.\n\nThat expectation didn't pan out.\n\nSpaceX took longer than planned, flying the inaugural astronaut launch of its Crew Dragon capsule in the summer of 2020. It has since completed 13 missions to orbit for NASA astronauts and paying customers.\n\nBut Boeing -- despite NASA officials initially believing the Starliner would be ready before SpaceX's Crew Dragon -- faced years of additional delays, setbacks and added expenses that have cost the company more than $1 billion, according to public financial records.\n\nNotably, the first Starliner test mission, flown without crew in late 2019, was riddled with missteps. The vehicle misfired in orbit, a symptom of software problems that included a coding error that set an internal clock off by 11 hours.\n\nA second uncrewed flight test in 2022 uncovered additional software issues and trouble with some of the vehicle's thrusters.\n\nThose hang-ups delayed the inaugural crewed flight into 2023.

Meanwhile, Boeing's rival under NASA's commercial crew program -- SpaceX -- has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency's astronauts.\n\nNow, NASA and Boeing have finally deemed the Starliner spacecraft ready for its ultimate test: allowing astronauts to test-drive the vehicle in outer space.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be on board Monday's mission, riding Starliner to the International Space Station for a weeklong stay.\n\nThroughout their flight, Wilmore and Williams will conduct a series of tests, including briefly taking over the controls of the autonomous spacecraft and evaluating how the vehicle operates for astronauts.\n\nA smooth flight could be a winning moment for Boeing's spaceflight program and the company overall, which has been in the hotseat due to issues with its commercial airplane division.\n\nHere's what to know about Starliner's journey before its historic crewed test flight.\n\nThe human component\n\nOfficials at Boeing have sought to make clear that Starliner operates separately from the sector at the company responsible for commercial aircraft. And the Starliner team's primary interest is in ensuring a smooth test mission and crew safety, according to Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner program manager at Boeing.\n\n\"We have humans flying on this vehicle. We always take that so seriously,\" Nappi said during a news briefing last week. \"I spent my career in this business, and it always has been the top of the list.\"\n\nThe two Starliner astronauts have waited years for the spacecraft to be deemed ready to carry crew. After several astronauts rotated in and out of assignments on Starliner's Crew Flight Test, Wilmore received his appointment in 2020. NASA moved Williams onto this flight in 2022 after initially assigning her in 2018 to a later Starliner mission.\n\n\"We've had a couple (of) launch dates, and we've been like, 'OK, we're ready to go,'\" Williams said at a Wednesday news conference. \"But now it's like, heck -- five days. It is actually, finally real, and I sort of have to pinch myself a little bit to understand, actually, we're going.\"\n\nAt a news briefing last month, Steve Stich, the program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said that NASA required Boeing and SpaceX to meet a certain threshold regarding the risk the mission would result in the death of astronauts -- 1 in 270.\n\n\"Boeing exceeds that number with a 1 in 295 loss of crew number,\" he said.\n\nStarliner's rocky path\n\nBoeing received a NASA contract to build Starliner in 2014 at the same time the space agency selected SpaceX to build its Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nNASA gave the companies deals worth up to $6.8 billion combined, hoping that Boeing and SpaceX would both have their capsules ready to fly as soon as 2017.\n\nThat expectation didn't pan out.\n\nSpaceX took longer than planned, flying the inaugural astronaut launch of its Crew Dragon capsule in the summer of 2020. It has since completed 13 missions to orbit for NASA astronauts and paying customers.\n\nBut Boeing -- despite NASA officials initially believing the Starliner would be ready before SpaceX's Crew Dragon -- faced years of additional delays, setbacks and added expenses that have cost the company more than $1 billion, according to public financial records.\n\nNotably, the first Starliner test mission, flown without crew in late 2019, was riddled with missteps. The vehicle misfired in orbit, a symptom of software problems that included a coding error that set an internal clock off by 11 hours.\n\nA second uncrewed flight test in 2022 uncovered additional software issues and trouble with some of the vehicle's thrusters.\n\nThose hang-ups delayed the inaugural crewed flight into 2023. But then a new slate of problems arose -- the spacecraft's parachutes had some components that were weaker than expected, and tape in the vehicle was found to be flammable.\n\nBoeing then had to remove more than a mile's worth of that tape and complete additional tests of the parachutes.\n\nFinally, after a decade of development, NASA and Boeing have cleared the vehicle to fly astronauts.\n\n'Everything's not going to be absolutely perfect'\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have taken a measured approach when responding to questions about the Starliner spacecraft's development woes.\n\n\"I understand it when you say 'setback,'\" Wilmore said during the recent news conference. \"But honestly, with all the discovery -- that's what we would term it -- that we've had, it's been steps forward.\n\n\"It's not been a setback, it's been pressing forward,\" he said. \"And our families have lived that with us.\"\n\nWilliams added that she is prepared to go into Monday's mission with the expectation that small issues may arise.\n\n\"We always find stuff, and we are going to continually find stuff,\" she said Wednesday. \"Everything's not going to be absolutely perfect as we fly the spacecraft. And that's really what our goal is. We've got it to a point -- all of us, big team -- got it to a point that we feel very safe and comfortable with how this spacecraft flies, and we have backup procedures in case we need those.\"\n\n\"We're here,\" Williams said, \"because we're ready.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Boeing's Nappi is reluctant to discuss other potential customers until this inaugural crew flight is over. But the company has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will

(AP) -- After years of delays and stumbles, Boeing is finally poised to launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA.\n\nIt's the first flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule with a crew on board, a pair of NASA pilots who will check out the spacecraft during the test drive and a weeklong stay at the space station.\n\nREAD MORE: Boeing is launching astronauts into space in its Starliner capsule. Here's what to know\n\nNASA turned to U.S. companies for astronaut rides after the space shuttles were retired. Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of unoccupied test flights.\n\nBoeing program manager Mark Nappi wishes Starliner was further along. \"There's no doubt about that, but we're here now.\"\n\nThe company's long-awaited astronaut demo is slated for liftoff Monday night.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nThe capsule\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed.\n\nThe crew\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts.

Wilmore is the designated commander for Monday's flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually.\n\nLaunch forecasts on Monday called for a 95% chance of favorable weather conditions, and ULA said on social media that \"all systems remain 'go'\" for an on-time liftoff.\n\nThe launch would mark the first crewed voyage to space using an Atlas rocket since the storied family of Atlas launch vehicles first sent astronauts, including John Glenn, on orbital flights for NASA's Mercury program in the 1960s.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the space station after a flight of about 26 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth early on Wednesday.\n\nWilmore and Williams are expected to remain at the space station for about a week before riding the Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for crewed NASA missions.\n\nThe test flight comes at an especially critical moment for Boeing. Its airplane business is dealing with fallout from a midair blowout of a cabin panel door plug on a nearly new 737 MAX 9 in January, as well as previous deadly crashes of two 737 MAX jets.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing, beset by years of development setbacks and more than $1.5 billion in charges for the aerospace giant on a $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA.\n\nThe space agency wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, which is expected to retire around 2030. NASA is encouraging private development of new space stations that could replace the ISS after its retirement, potentially giving Starliner new destinations.\n\nThe first attempt by Boeing to send an uncrewed Starliner to the space station in 2019 failed due to dozens of software and engineering glitches. A second attempt in 2022 succeeded, paving the way for Monday night's mission.\n\nDepending on the outcome, Starliner is booked to fly at least six more crewed missions to the space station for NASA.\n\nAt a pre-flight briefing with NASA officials on Friday, Boeing vice president Mark Nappi said the company and the space agency were \"in total agreement\" that the Starliner was ready to fly with crew, adding, \"we can't be more confident.\"\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson said. \"That's why we put two test pilots on board.\"\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles;

Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of unoccupied test flights.\n\nBoeing program manager Mark Nappi wishes Starliner was further along. \"There's no doubt about that, but we're here now.\"\n\nThe company's long-awaited astronaut demo is slated for liftoff Monday night.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts. The duo have been involved in the capsule's development and insist Starliner is ready for prime time, otherwise they would not strap in for the launch.\n\n\"We're not putting our heads in the sand,\" Williams told The Associated Press. \"Sure, Boeing has had its problems. But we are the QA (quality assurance). Our eyes are on the spacecraft.\"\n\nStarliner will blast off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It will be the first time astronauts ride an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Sixty-two years later, this will be the 100th launch of the Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft.\n\n\"We're super careful with every mission. We're super, duper, duper careful\" with human missions, said Tory Bruno, CEO of ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station in roughly 26 hours. The seven station residents will have their eyes peeled on the approaching capsule. The arrival of a new vehicle is \"a really big deal. You leave nothing to chance,\" NASA astronaut Michael Barratt told the AP from orbit. Starliner will remain docked for eight days, undergoing checkouts before landing in New Mexico or elsewhere in the American West.\n\nBoth companies' capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA's Orion capsules for moon missions. Wilmore and Williams briefly will take manual control to wring out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was in the station delivery business and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing will use a more traditional \"astrovan\" equipped with a video screen that Wilmore said will be playing \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\nOne big difference at flight's end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station's planned end in 2030. Boeing's Nappi is reluctant to discuss other potential customers until this inaugural crew flight is over. But the company has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will deliver cargo to the station later this year or next, before accepting passengers.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts. The duo have been involved in the capsule's development and insist Starliner is ready for prime time, otherwise they would not strap in for the launch.\n\n\"We're not putting our heads in the sand,\" Williams told The Associated Press. \"Sure, Boeing has had its problems. But we are the QA (quality assurance). Our eyes are on the spacecraft.\"\n\nStarliner will blast off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It will be the first time astronauts ride an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Sixty-two years later, this will be the 100th launch of the Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft.\n\n\"We're super careful with every mission. We're super, duper, duper careful\" with human missions, said Tory Bruno, CEO of ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station in roughly 26 hours. The seven station residents will have their eyes peeled on the approaching capsule. The arrival of a new vehicle is \"a really big deal. You leave nothing to chance,\" NASA astronaut Michael Barratt told the AP from orbit. Starliner will remain docked for eight days, undergoing checkouts before landing in New Mexico or elsewhere in the American West.\n\nBoth companies' capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA's Orion capsules for moon missions. Wilmore and Williams briefly will take manual control to wring out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was in the station delivery business and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing will use a more traditional \"astrovan\" equipped with a video screen that Wilmore said will be playing \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\nOne big difference at flight's end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station's planned end in 2030. Boeing's Nappi is reluctant to discuss other potential customers until this inaugural crew flight is over. But the company has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will deliver cargo to the station later this year or next, before accepting passengers.\n\nPictured at top: Boeing's Starliner capsule atop an Atlas V rocket is rolled out to the launch pad at Space Launch Complex 41 in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on May 4, 2024.

Wilmore is the designated commander for Monday's flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary, and the test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually.\n\nWith forecasts calling for a 95% chance of favorable weather conditions, ULA completed a launch readiness review on Friday and gave a \"go\" to proceed toward countdown at Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe launch would mark the first crewed voyage to space using an Atlas rocket since the storied family of Atlas launch vehicles first sent astronauts, including John Glenn, on orbital flights for NASA's Mercury program in the 1960s.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the space station after a flight of about 26 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth early on Wednesday.\n\nWilmore and Williams are expected to remain at the space station for about a week before riding the Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for crewed NASA missions.\n\nSuccess is vital before the Starliner gains final approval to begin routine operational flights under NASA's commercial crew program, providing the space agency its first alternative to sending astronauts to low-Earth orbit from U.S. soil since Elon Musk's SpaceX began doing so in 2020.\n\nThe test flight comes at an especially critical moment for Boeing, whose commercial aircraft unit has endured a succession of safety crises in recent years.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing, beset by years of development setbacks and more than $1.5 billion in cost overruns for the aerospace giant on a $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA.\n\nThe first attempt by Boeing to send an uncrewed Starliner to the space station in 2019 failed due to dozens of software and engineering glitches. A second attempt in 2022 succeeded, paving the way for Monday night's mission.\n\nDepending on the outcome, Starliner is booked to fly at least six more crewed missions to the space station for NASA.\n\nAt a pre-flight briefing with NASA officials on Friday, Boeing vice president Mark Nappi said the company and the space agency were \"in total agreement\" that the Starliner was ready to fly with crew, adding, \"we can't be more confident.\"\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson said. \"That's why we put two test pilots on board.\"", "source":

NASA chief Bill Nelson reiterated the significance of the mission, emphasising the safety measures in place for this test flight with two experienced test pilots on board.\n\n(With Reuters inputs)", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/starliner-hero-0920-1280x720-171499390995316_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of unoccupied test flights.\n\nBoeing program manager Mark Nappi wishes Starliner was further along. \"There's no doubt about that, but we're here now,\" he said.\n\nThe company's long-awaited astronaut demo is slated for liftoff Monday night.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then, last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts.\n\nThe duo has been involved in the capsule's development and insists that Starliner is ready for prime time; otherwise, they would not strap in for the launch.\n\n\"We're not putting our heads in the sand,\" Williams told The Associated Press (AP). \"Sure, Boeing has had its problems. But we are the QA (quality assurance). Our eyes are on the spacecraft.\"\n\nStarliner will blast off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It will be the first time astronauts ride an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn, who became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962.\n\nSixty-two years later, this will be the 100th launch of the Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites, as well as spacecraft.\n\n\"We're super careful with every mission. We're super, duper, duper careful with human missions,\" said Tory Bruno, CEO of ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station in roughly 26 hours. The seven station residents will have their eyes peeled on the approaching capsule. The arrival of a new vehicle is \"a really big deal. You leave nothing to chance,\" NASA astronaut Michael Barratt told the AP from orbit.\n\nStarliner will remain docked for eight days, undergoing checkouts before landing in New Mexico or elsewhere in the American West.\n\nBoth companies' capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA's Orion capsules for moon missions.\n\nWilmore and Williams will briefly take manual control to wring out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX was already in the station delivery business and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for the crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing will use a more traditional \"Astrovan\" equipped with a video screen that Wilmore said will be playing \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\nOne big difference at the flight's end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station's planned end in 2030. Boeing's Nappi is reluctant to discuss other potential customers until this inaugural crew flight is over. But the company has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple of weeks.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini-shuttle, Dream Chaser, will deliver cargo to the station later this year or next, before accepting passengers.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The flight, if it succeeds, will become the second private firm being able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS.\n\nThe launch is scheduled to take place on 10:34 p.m. EDT Monday, May 6, ie May 7 at 8.04 am Indian Standard Time.\n\nBoeing's competitor Elon Musk's SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in the year 2020. It has sent 12 crewed missions to the ISS since 2020.

The Starliner flight to the ISS is expected to last about 26 hours, and the two astronauts will live and work on the ISS for 8 days before undocking and returning to Earth on May 15.\n\nDuring the test flight, the astronaut duo will take the Starliner through a series of tests before NASA certifies it to be fit to fly to space on rotational missions to the ISS under the US space agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nUnlike previous US capsules that splashed down in the sea on returning to Earth, the Starliner will touch down on land at a site somewhere in the western part of the United States, NASA said.\n\nBoth the astronoauts will be launching on a United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore were both former commanders of the International Space Station.\n\nWilliams, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology. Her first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007) launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Station, according to NASA.\n\nWhile onboard, Williams established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.Selected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Williams has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks.\n\nWilliams worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old, Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.\n\nBoeing has planned six manned missions for the platform over the next six years, the projected end of the ISS' operating lifespan.\n\nNASA plans to use both SpaceX's Dragon and Boeing's Starliner to send up astronauts at least every six months from US soil. Both Boeing and SpaceX were given the responsibility in 2014 by NASA to send commercial crew missions to the ISS.\n\nBoeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner,

But Boeing has largely lagged behind its competitor, which launched its first crewed mission in 2020, as reported by Reuters.\n\nIt was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the ISS.\n\nWho are the astronauts on board the Boeing Starliner?\n\nThe two NASA astronauts on board the Starliner for Monday's launch are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, both Navy test pilots who have previously flown in space twice.

Tests will be performed to check it is working properly, and then Williams and Wilmore will reboard the capsule to return home.\n\nA successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by the numerous setbacks in the Starliner program.\n\nIn 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, the capsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching the ISS.\n\nThen in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.\n\nThe empty vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022. But problems since then have delayed Monday's crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA's use on regular ISS missions.\n\nNASA associate administrator Jim Free had predicted the mission would not be hiccup-free.\n\n\"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, things we expect to learn, being a test mission. We may encounter things we don't expect,\" Free said, noting that Starliner is just the sixth US-built class of vessel for NASA astronauts.\n\nSpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club in 2020, following the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle programs.\n\nIn 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules.\n\nOnce Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to ferry astronauts to the ISS.\n\nEven though the ISS is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used to taxi humans to future private space stations, which several companies are planning to build.\n\nla/bpe/nro/caw\n\nMore from this section\n\nStriking deals to end campus protests, some colleges invite discussion of their investments", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station_programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (planet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/61/261aa674-24f1-5094-8397-c1eb121023a0/6638757767184.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

CNN will carry live updates of the mission online shortly before liftoff.\n\nWeather or technical issues can always force a rocket launch to scrub all the way up until the countdown clock strikes zero, but the forecast for this evening is as good as it gets. Weather officials have said there's only a 5% chance that clouds, winds or storms will interrupt tonight's takeoff.\n\nThis mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing's spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency's Commercial Crew Program. The Starliner would join SpaceX's Crew Dragon in NASA's push to collaborate with private industry partners, expanding the United States' options for ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nThe mission crew members are veteran astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, each of whom has ventured to space on two previous journeys aboard NASA space shuttle and Russian Soyuz missions.\n\n\"They're checking out a lot of the systems: the life support, the manual control,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during a Friday news conference. \"That's why we put two test pilots on board -- and of course the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of Butch and Suni are extensive.\"\n\nIf all goes to plan, the crew will board the Starliner capsule and lift off atop an Atlas V rocket Monday night. The spacecraft -- carrying the astronauts -- will break away from the rocket after reaching orbit and begin firing its own engines. The Starliner will then spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station, where the vehicle is expected to dock at 12:46 a.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week aboard the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside.\n\nThe two will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.\n\nMuch is riding on a smooth test flight. NASA has been waiting half a decade for Starliner to begin flying crew, and the development of Starliner was beset by years of delays, setbacks and blunders. More broadly, Boeing as a company has suffered years of scandals in its aircraft division that have tarnished the legacy aerospace giant's brand.\n\n\"We got through a pretty rigorous process to get here,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner program manager at Boeing, of the development process during the Friday briefing. \"And really where my source of confidence comes from is going through that process.\"\n\nIf successful, the Crew Test Flight could queue up Boeing to begin flying routine trips to the space station on NASA's behalf.\n\nThe US space agency selected Boeing to develop Starliner -- alongside SpaceX and its Crew Dragon capsule -- in 2014, hoping the commercial companies could create complementary new means of ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station after the space shuttle program retired in 2011.\n\nSpaceX ultimately beat Boeing to the launchpad, carrying out its crewed flight test of the Crew Dragon capsule in May 2020. SpaceX has handled most of NASA's crew transportation needs since then.\n\n\"We cheer for SpaceX. That's something that is very important to our country and very important to NASA to have that access.\" Nappi said during a March news briefing. \"And we're looking forward to providing (astronaut transportation services) as well.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Since 2020, Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine flights for NASA, while Boeing has only been able to conduct unmanned trial flights.\n\nStressing that Starliner's development should be further along the road, Boeing program manager Mark Nappi said, \"There is no doubt about that, but we are here now.\"\n\nThe company's long-awaited flight with astronauts on board is scheduled for liftoff on April 6 evening, and if successful, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to transport astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule measures some 10 feet tall and 15 feet in diameter and can carry seven people. However, NASA crews typically number four astronauts.\n\nAboard the craft will be veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore, 61, and Sunita Williams, 58, who are retired Navy captains.

Astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams will pilot the Starliner on its inaugural crewed flight -- a crucial final test before NASA can authorize Boeing to conduct routine flights to and from the space station for the agency.\n\nThe stakes are high. This will be Boeing's first launch with humans aboard its spaceship, and it comes after years of delays, technical setbacks and significant budget overruns. If successful, the flight will enable Boeing to challenge the dominance held by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has been ferrying NASA astronauts to and from the orbiting outpost since 2020.\n\nBoth companies' spacecraft were developed under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which was established after its space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. The goal: incentivize and help fund the creation of new, commercially built vehicles capable of flying to and from low-Earth orbit.\n\nAt a preflight briefing last week, Wilmore said safety is paramount and that previous Starliner launch attempts -- both uncrewed and crewed -- were delayed because the capsule simply was not ready until now.\n\n\"Why do we think it's as safe as possible? We wouldn't be standing here if we didn't,\" Wilmore told reporters.\n\nStill, there are inherent risks with any new spacecraft or rocket.\n\n\"Do we expect it to go perfectly? This is the first human flight of the spacecraft,\" Wilmore said. \"I'm sure we'll find things out. That's why we do this. This is a test flight.\"\n\nThe plan is for the astronauts to dock with the space station the following day and spend about a week there before returning to Earth and touching down at Starliner's primary landing site in New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range.\n\nWhile NASA astronauts have for years been flying aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, the agency does not want to rely on a single company, said Makena Young, a fellow with the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Having that second option is really important because it adds redundancy and resiliency,\" Young said. \"In space systems, there are always redundancies, because if something goes wrong, you want to make sure that you have backups.\"\n\nBoeing's journey to this first crewed flight has been turbulent. In 2019, the Starliner's uncrewed debut was cut short after software glitches prevented the capsule from attempting to dock at the space station. Subsequent fuel valve issues caused several delays before Boeing was able to successfully demonstrate in 2022 that the Starliner could dock at the ISS and return to Earth.\n\nEarlier this year, Boeing's aviation arm came under fire after a panel blew out midflight on one of its 737 Max 9 airplanes. That major mishap increased scrutiny of the entire company, and it likely raised the stakes for the upcoming Starliner flight, Young said.\n\n\"Having a successful launch will be an incredibly important reminder of [Boeing's] capabilities,\" she said. \"They'll be able to show that they are a reliable operator who is able to complete difficult missions and can continue to innovate.\"\n\nYoung added that the challenges Boeing faced in getting the Starliner to this point show just how tough human spaceflight can be.\n\n\"I think that we forget because we've done it now for decades, but space is still a very difficult environment,\" she said. \"It's actually very difficult to successfully get off the ground.\"\n\nWilliams said she and Wilmore have confidence in the Starliner program and their mission ahead.\n\n\"We feel very safe and very comfortable when this spacecraft flies,\" Williams told reporters earlier this week. \"This is where we're supposed to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "denise_chow@aol.com", "name": "Denise Chow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri":

Starliner has faced several delays over the years, with its first uncrewed test flight in 2019 ending in failure before it successfully docked at the International Space Station in 2022. While Starliner's first crewed flight was supposed to take place last May, NASA delayed the launch due to technical issues.\n\nThe launch will take place at 10:34PM ET from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, and you can watch it live from NASA's YouTube channel.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket will propel the Starliner aircraft to space, where it will stay at the ISS for one week. While on board, flight commander Butch Wilmore and pilot Suni Williams will test the Starliner's capabilities, including launching, docking, and its eventual return to Earth.\n\nBoeing built the Starliner as part of its $4.2 billion contract with NASA, which encourages the development of new spacecraft from private companies through the agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nIf all goes well during this flight, NASA will certify Starliner, allowing it to ferry NASA astronauts between Earth and the ISS.

Williams and commander Butch Wilmore are now expected to launch on the 10-day Crew Test Flight no earlier than May 6. \"I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now,\" Williams added.\n\nWilmore and Williams, in fact, were initially assigned to the operational and six-month-long Starliner-1 mission scheduled to fly after CFT. Many other crew swap-outs also happened in the intervening years, but everyone always had confidence in Starliner: \"it's a solid spacecraft,\" Williams told reporters at a press conference here at NASA's Johnson Space Center.\n\nRelated: 1st Boeing Starliner astronauts are ready to launch to the ISS for NASA (exclusive)\n\nBoth Boeing and Space were tasked in 2014 to bring NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard commercial crew spacecraft. SpaceX has been doing so operationally since 2020, while Starliner had to wait to address numerous technical issues. (Boeing, NASA and the astronauts all stress that the relevant problems have been addressed ahead of launch day.)\n\nWhile the spacecraft is certified for an astronaut test flight, the work is not over. CFT is a developmental mission, former Navy test pilot Wilmore stressed at the same press conference. This means the astronauts, their support teams and even the Starliner-1 crew (now expected to launch in 2025) are creating the training program as they're going along. The spacecraft is also continuing to change, if slightly.\n\n\"We are sort of the trailblazers, if you will, getting those training processes in place and developing them,\" Williams told reporters. And that mindset requires, he said a bit later on, looking beyond a \"finish line\" or setting firm dates for any mission milestone.\n\n\"We are trained in flight test, and by the good Lord's allowing, we are now in a position for spaceflight test -- which not a lot of people have had the opportunity to do. And we take that very seriously,\" said Williams. \"So we look at the tasks at hand, the ones that are close or that we're dealing with at the time, (while) also always looking at the long-term mission. So the finish line is not something that I focus on.\"\n\nRelated: Boeing begins fueling Starliner capsule ahead of 1st astronaut launch\n\nWilliams said the years of extra practice have given her confidence that both Boeing and NASA have looked at the small details for their shakedown mission, including adding numerous backups for procedures and systems.\n\nThe spacecraft, for example, could run through all major procedures with no communications. The astronauts can also take over any automatic system during docking or landing to steer Starliner in the right direction, and the team is well-rehearsed on launch aborts and other critical procedures.\n\n\"I feel like we've invested the time\" since the first uncrewed flight test that failed to see Starliner reach the ISS in 2019, Williams said; after all, Starliner made it there on its second try in 2022. The team, she said later in the conference, is \"pretty sharp\" because \"we've gone through this process together.\"\n\n\"We really looked into the spacecraft, and delved into everything that we could know about it, and (added) some changes on things where we thought there needed to be changes,\" she added. \"That's why I think we're ready to go, because we have been part of ... that developmental process. It wasn't quite done, and we noticed that, and we've worked to make sure now it's done. It's ready.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n-- NASA, Boeing hail Starliner space capsule launch success despite thruster glitch\n\n-- Boeing's Starliner crew capsule channels R2-D2 ahead of astronaut test flight\n\n-- NASA, Boeing delay Starliner capsule's 1st astronaut launch to early May\n\nWith the years of training starting to close, Wilmore said he is allowing himself to think about the emotions of launch day. \"I'm looking forward to walking to the pad, and the launch,\" he said, adding, \"It's a great seat to be in.\"\n\nWilliams added she wants to pinch herself at the prospect of her first spaceflight in a dozen years, since launching on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2012. (Wilmore's last flight was almost as long ago, in 2015.) While the crew is not quite aboard CFT yet, she said entering quarantine will make it feel more real.\n\n\"That's sort of getting to be it, and then it's all icing on the cake. By that time, pretty much everything's done,\" Williams said of quarantine. After launch, there's also a familiar sight to look forward to: \"I really cannot wait 'til we see space station through the window.

The spacecraft successfully docked with the I.S.S. during its second test flight in 2022, despite the failure of some thrusters during the launch.\n\nBoeing then scrapped the planned launch of the Starliner's first crewed flight last year, after company officials realized that adhesive tape used on the craft to wrap hundreds of yards of wiring was flammable, and lines connecting the capsule to its three parachutes appeared to be weaker than expected. The launch was delayed indefinitely.\n\nThe aerospace giant and NASA now believe the Starliner is ready for its first crewed voyage into orbit.\n\n\"We are to a state now where we are ready to perform the test flight,\" Mark Nappi, Boeing vice president and program manager of the Commercial Crew Program, said during a Friday press conference. \"I've never felt readier on any mission that I've ever participated in.\"\n\nUnited Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket is scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida late Monday evening.\n\nTwo veteran NASA astronauts -- Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams -- will fly aboard the Starliner and spend about a week at the I.S.S. before returning to Earth.\n\n\"We feel very safe and very comfortable when this spacecraft flies,\" Williams said earlier this month. \"This is where we're supposed to be.\"\n\nWilmore told reporters earlier this month that his and Williams' backgrounds as Navy pilots propelled them onto the Starliner mission.\n\n\"I know I don't think either one of us ever dreamed that we'd be associated with the first flight of a brand new spacecraft,\" Wilmore said. \"But we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for that.\"\n\nLaura Forczyk, executive director of the space consulting firm Astralytical, said the \"stakes are higher\" for this test flight because it's the first time Starliner will travel with people on board.\n\nForczyk said the two-year gap between the Starliner's last successful test flight and Monday's planned launch \"both gives me confidence, because it means that NASA and Boeing are taking this very seriously, but it also makes me nervous because it has been two years since this vehicle has been operational.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing has been facing intense scrutiny this year on the commercial aviation side of its business after a rear door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines flight shortly after takeoff in January.\n\nWhistleblowers have since come forward to detail alleged quality control lapses at the storied company, and the Federal Aviation Administration said it was opening an audit into Boeing's production.

And after everybody had polled go, Butch got on and wanted to say one thing to the team and he said he's go for launch.\"\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program awarded Boeing and SpaceX contracts back in 2014 to build spacecraft capable of flying its astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nStarliner is only the sixth ever U.S.-based spacecraft to fly with NASA astronauts following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle and SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nIt also marks a return of human launches from Cape Canaveral's launch pads, which last saw a crewed flight in 1968 with the launch of Apollo 7. Every Apollo mission afterward as well as the space shuttle and Crew Dragon launches have come from nearby Kennedy Space Center.\n\nIt's the first time an Atlas V will fly with humans as well, although earlier iterations of the Atlas rocket flew several human spaceflights in the early 1960s including John Glenn's historic trip to space as the first American to each orbit in 1962. This also marks the 100th launch of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nStarliner will also become the first U.S.-based capsule to make a land touchdown as Crew Dragon, Apollo, Gemini and Mercury all made water landings, as will the Artemis program's Orion capsule that has yet to fly with humans. Russia's Soyuz, though, features land touchdowns.\n\nDragon and Starliner are NASA's solution to replace the retired Space Shuttle Program that last flew in 2011 and end its reliance on Soyuz that filled the gap as NASA's only option for nearly nine years.\n\nThat's when SpaceX was able to complete its crewed test flight in 2020. Elon Musk's company has since flown its fleet of Crew Dragons 13 times carrying 50 humans to space, including the four members of Crew-8 who await the arrival of Starliner on board the ISS.\n\nThe CFT mission comes nearly two years since Starliner last flew on the Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2), a successful trip to the ISS without a crew, just a mannequin named \"Rosie the Rocketeer.\"\n\nThe first human to ever venture into Starliner in space was actually NASA's Bob Hines, a member of Crew-4 in 2022.\n\n\"Nobody stepped inside. I floated inside,\" he said. \"It was me. I got to open the hatch ... We had agreed early on that as a new guy, this was a good project for me to kind of take on, and so I was the lead for when the Starliner mission was up there on space station.\"\n\nHe is now part of the NASA's joint test team for crews prepping for both SpaceX Dragon and Boeing Starliner, and has been working with the CFT crew leading up to this launch.\n\n\"I got to open the hatch and go in and kind of lead that mission,\" he said. \"It was pretty cool, and it's almost coming full circle here being very involved in getting crew off the ground.\"\n\nHaving flown up to the ISS on Dragon, he took note of the differences between the two capsules.\n\n\"One, it was very obvious that there are different philosophies in approaching human spaceflight, which is really neat to see as a test pilot,\" he said. \"A different cabin layout, a totally different capsule design, a different philosophy for operating the vehicle ... So it was really neat and eye opening to see another solution.\"\n\nBoeing aims for Starliner astronaut launch Monday after delays, $1.5 billion spent\n\nThat mission was a do-over mission from the original uncrewed test flight, now referred to as OFT-1, that in 2019 saw myriad issues including not being able to dock with the ISS. But now nearly four years behind SpaceX, Boeing, which has spent more than $1.5 billion on Starliner's development, looks to finally get its spacecraft certified to perform normal rotational missions to the ISS.\n\n\"It's important that we're making history. I feel that a lot as the Commercial Crew Program manager,\" Stich said. \"It was just four years ago we brought the Dragon spacecraft online and the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, and then here we are now four years later bringing another system online.\"\n\nStich said the years of delay aren't as important as making sure the flight is a safe one.\n\n\"We've been taking our time to go through everything methodically because it is a test flight, and we want it to go well,\" he said. \"I'm sure we'll learn something on orbit and we'll learn something during the flight but our team is checking, double checking everything and making sure we're really ready to go.\"\n\nIf all goes well with CFT, that first operational mission, dubbed Starliner-1, could fly with four astronauts to the ISS as early as next February and become the first of six Boeing missions that would share taxi duties with SpaceX to the station until the ISS is decommissioned after 2030.\n\n\"We have been striving in Commercial Crew to have two independent space transportation systems,\" Stich said. \"That's been our goal since from Commercial Crew's inception and we're very close to reaching that goal.\"",

Success is vital before the Starliner gains final approval to begin routine operational flights under NASA's commercial crew program, providing the space agency its first alternative to sending astronauts to low-Earth orbit from U.S. soil since Elon Musk's SpaceX began doing so in 2020.\n\nBoeing Co's new Starliner astronaut capsule was poised for a Monday night launch of its long-delayed inaugural crewed test flight to the International Space Station, two years after its first voyage without humans to the orbital laboratory.\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped CST-100 Starliner with two astronauts aboard was due for liftoff at 10:34 p.m. (0234 GMT on Tuesday) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carried atop an Atlas V rocket furnished by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA). Riding aboard the Starliner, designed to carry up to seven crew members, are veteran NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain, and Sunita \"Sunni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy aviator and test pilot.\n\nThey have logged a combined 500 days in space over the course of two missions each to the space station. Wilmore is the designated commander for Monday's flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. Although Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary, and the test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually.\n\nWith forecasts calling for a 95% chance of favorable weather conditions, ULA completed a launch readiness review on Friday and gave a \"go\" to proceed toward countdown at Cape Canaveral. The launch would mark the first crewed voyage to space using an Atlas rocket since the storied family of Atlas launch vehicles first sent astronauts, including John Glenn, on orbital flights for NASA's Mercury program in the 1960s.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the space station after a flight of about 26 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth early on Wednesday. Wilmore and Williams are expected to remain at the space station for about a week before riding the Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for crewed NASA missions.\n\nSuccess is vital before the Starliner gains final approval to begin routine operational flights under NASA's commercial crew program, providing the space agency its first alternative to sending astronauts to low-Earth orbit from U.S. soil since Elon Musk's SpaceX began doing so in 2020. The test flight comes at an especially critical moment for Boeing, whose commercial aircraft unit has endured a succession of safety crises in recent years.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing, beset by years of development setbacks and more than $1.5 billion in cost overruns for the aerospace giant on a $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA. The first attempt by Boeing to send an uncrewed Starliner to the space station in 2019 failed due to dozens of software and engineering glitches. A second attempt in 2022 succeeded, paving the way for Monday night's mission.\n\nDepending on the outcome, Starliner is booked to fly at least six more crewed missions to the space station for NASA. At a pre-flight briefing with NASA officials on Friday, Boeing vice president Mark Nappi said the company and the space agency were \"in total agreement\" that the Starliner was ready to fly with crew, adding, \"we can't be more confident.\"\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson said. \"That's why we put two test pilots on board.\"\n\n(This story

(AP) -- After years of delays and stumbles, Boeing is finally poised to launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA.\n\nIt's the first flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule with a crew on board, a pair of NASA pilots who will check out the spacecraft during the test drive and a weeklong stay at the space station.\n\nNASA turned to U.S. companies for astronaut rides after the space shuttles were retired. Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of unoccupied test flights.\n\nBoeing program manager Mark Nappi wishes Starliner was further along. \"There's no doubt about that, but we're here now.\"\n\nThe company's long-awaited astronaut demo is slated for liftoff Monday night.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nTHE CAPSULE\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed.THE CREW\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts. The duo have been involved in the capsule's development and insist Starliner is ready for prime time, otherwise they would not strap in for the launch.\n\n\"We're not putting our heads in the sand,\" Williams told The Associated Press. \"Sure, Boeing has had its problems. But we are the QA (quality assurance). Our eyes are on the spacecraft.\"\n\nTHE TEST FLIGHT\n\nStarliner will blast off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It will be the first time astronauts ride an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Sixty-two years later, this will be the 100th launch of the Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft.\n\n\"We're super careful with every mission. We're super, duper, duper careful\" with human missions, said Tory Bruno, CEO of ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station in roughly 26 hours. The seven station residents will have their eyes peeled on the approaching capsule. The arrival of a new vehicle is \"a really big deal. You leave nothing to chance,\" NASA astronaut Michael Barratt told the AP from orbit. Starliner will remain docked for eight days, undergoing checkouts before landing in New Mexico or elsewhere in the American West.\n\nSTARLINER VS. DRAGON\n\nBoth companies' capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA's Orion capsules for moon missions. Wilmore and Williams briefly will take manual control to wring out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was in the station delivery business and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing will use a more traditional \"astrovan\" equipped with a video screen that Wilmore said will be playing \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\nOne big difference at flight's end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station's planned end in 2030. Boeing's Nappi is reluctant to discuss other potential customers until this inaugural crew flight is over. But the company has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will deliver cargo to the station later this year or next, before accepting passengers.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The vehicle is slated to return them to Earth about a week after docking with the facility, landing in the western U.S. under parachutes.\n\nBoeing has developed rockets, spacecraft and other vehicles for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for decades, including hardware for the Apollo moon missions. But the aerospace company has tripped up with Starliner, struggling at times with software, a communications system, valves, parachutes and even a type of tape used in the vehicle. The project has led to $1.4 billion in accounting losses for Boeing.\n\nMonday's planned mission comes as Boeing faces intense scrutiny over its bread-and-butter airplane business. Lawmakers and airline executives have blasted the company's manufacturing failures after a segment on one of its planes blew out midair earlier this year, threatening passengers and crew on board. Air-safety regulators have ratcheted up oversight of the company's operations.\n\n\"Spaceflight is risky. It is unforgiving of mistakes,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in an interview. \"NASA is integrated with Boeing to make sure that this flight is as safe as possible.\"\n\nMark Nappi, a Boeing vice president, said the company's spacecraft is ready to carry astronauts. Since taking over management of Starliner about two years ago, Nappi said he has focused his team on shifting from design and development to operations. Around 500 people are working on the program.\n\n\"We've been very disciplined, following the process. NASA is right there with us and that makes me feel comfortable,\" he said during an interview in March.\n\nA successful mission and NASA's subsequent certification of Starliner are the final milestones that Boeing needs to meet before the spacecraft makes regular crew rotations. Starliner's problems have left the agency dependent on Elon Musk's SpaceX for those flights from the U.S., prompting concern at the agency about relying too heavily on one supplier. SpaceX didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nLeaders at both Boeing and NASA have said they won't hesitate to again postpone Starliner's flight, should any safety risks emerge in the run-up to the launch.\n\nStarliner will blast off from Florida, propelled by an Atlas V rocket, a proven booster that rocket operator United Launch Alliance has flown for years. After Starliner separates from the rocket, it will take about a day to reach the space station, where it is designed to autonomously dock with the lab.\n\nThe astronauts Starliner will carry -- Williams, 58 years old, and Wilmore, 61 -- are retired Navy aviators who have been in orbit before. Each traveled to the space station on both NASA's former space shuttle and Russian Soyuz vehicles.\n\nWilliams said the team working on Starliner, including herself and Wilmore, rigorously analyzed problems that emerged with the vehicle earlier, including the stuck valves and software challenges.\n\n\"We all pushed on it,\" she said in a recent interview. \"We feel very confident that we're at a point that we're good with how the spacecraft is going to operate.\"\n\nBoeing's work on Starliner goes back more than a decade. NASA in 2014 awarded the company and SpaceX contracts to create new vehicles to fly crews to and from the space station, seeking two distinct spacecraft from U.S. aerospace companies. At the time, the agency depended on Russia for crew rotations, following the retirement of its shuttle fleet.\n\nNASA rated Boeing as better prepared than the Musk-led company for technical maturity, management and other categories used to evaluate the bids. At SpaceX, which had been transporting cargo to the space station, some former employees said the company took it as a challenge to beat Boeing in astronaut missions.\n\nIn late 2019, Boeing launched the first Starliner mission, an uncrewed operation designed to test the vehicle under flight conditions without astronauts on board. The mission went poorly, dogged by software coding errors and the unexpected loss of a communications system. Starliner didn't attempt one of its major goals for the mission -- docking with the space station.\n\nAfter the flight, NASA officials increased oversight of Boeing's Starliner efforts, saying the agency had relied too much on the company's internal engineering decisions. A review team analyzing the botched 2019 mission recommended Boeing make dozens of changes, including more testing of how hardware and software on the vehicle are integrated.\n\nSpaceX in 2020 flew two astronauts to the station on its competing Crew Dragon vehicle, marking the first human space flight from the U.S. in nearly a decade.\n\nIn 2021, Boeing stacked Starliner on a rocket in what was meant to be a do-over of the earlier flight. But the company ran into trouble again, this time with stuck valves in a propulsion system. It later resolved the issue and completed the uncrewed operation, setting it up for a mission with astronauts last year.\n\nThe company and NASA delayed that mission, though, after identifying issues with the Starliner parachute system as well as potentially flammable tape Boeing used. Boeing's Nappi said neither problem posed major risks but did narrow the margin for safe operations.\n\n\"Since it was the first flight, and we don't have much history with the vehicle, it was Boeing's decision not to accept that,\" he said.\n\nThe company completed another test of its parachute system in January and removed about a mile of the tape from Starliner.\n\nSpaceX has demonstrated its ability to safely and reliably fly its fleet to the research lab, said Steve Stich, a program manager at NASA. The company has launched astronauts for the agency nine times over the past four years.\n\n\"But you're just one flight away from some anomaly that you didn't catch,\" showing why the agency wants to have two vehicles, he said. With Boeing's Starliner, he said, \"It's worth taking the risk of that first test flight, which is always hard.\"", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

Launching from the Kennedy Space Center, this last crucial test for Starliner will test out the new spacecraft and take the pair to the International Space Station for about a week.\n\nPart of NASA's commercial crew program, this long-delayed mission will represent the vehicle's first crewed launch. If successful, it will give NASA - and in the future, space tourists - more options for getting to low Earth orbit.\n\nFrom my perspective as a space policy expert, Starliner's launch represents another significant milestone in the development of the commercial space industry. But the mission's troubled history also shows just how difficult the path to space can be, even for an experienced company like Boeing.\n\nOrigins and development\n\nFollowing the retirement of NASA's space shuttle in 2011, NASA invited commercial space companies to help the agency transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station.\n\nIn 2014, NASA selected Boeing and SpaceX to build their respective crew vehicles: Starliner and Dragon.\n\nBoeing's vehicle, Starliner, was built to carry up to seven crew members to and from low Earth orbit. For NASA missions to the International Space Station, it will carry up to four at a time, and it's designed to remain docked to the station for up to seven months. At 15 feet, the capsule where the crew will sit is slightly bigger than an Apollo command module or a SpaceX Dragon.\n\nBoeing designed Starliner to be partially reusable to reduce the cost of getting to space. Though the Atlas V rocket it will take to space and the service module that supports the craft are both expendable, Starliner's crew capsule can be reused up to 10 times, with a six-month turnaround. Boeing has built two flightworthy Starliners to date.\n\nStarliner's development has come with setbacks. Though Boeing received US$4.2 billion from NASA, compared with $2.6 billion for SpaceX, Boeing spent more than $1.5 billion extra in developing the spacecraft.\n\nOn Starliner's first uncrewed test flight in 2019, a series of software and hardware failures prevented it from getting to its planned orbit as well as docking with the International Space Station. After testing out some of its systems, it landed successfully at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.\n\nIn 2022, after identifying and making more than 80 fixes, Starliner conducted a second uncrewed test flight. This time, the vehicle did successfully dock with the International Space Station and landed six days later in New Mexico.\n\nStill, Boeing delayed the first crewed launch for Starliner from 2023 to 2024 because of additional problems. One involved Starliner's parachutes, which help to slow the vehicle as it returns to Earth. Tests found that some links in those parachute lines were weaker than expected, which could have caused them to break. A second problem was the use of flammable tape that could pose a fire hazard.\n\nA major question stemming from these delays concerns why Starliner has been so difficult to develop. For one, NASA officials admitted that it did not provide as much oversight for Starliner as it did for SpaceX's Dragon because of the agency's familiarity with Boeing.\n\nAnd Boeing has experienced several problems recently, most visibly with the safety of its airplanes. Astronaut Butch Wilmore has denied that Starliner's problems reflect these troubles.\n\nBut several of Boeing's other space activities beyond Starliner have also experienced mechanical failures and budget pressure, including the Space Launch System. This system is planned to be the main rocket for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to return humans to the Moon for the first time since the Apollo era.\n\nSignificance for NASA and commercial spaceflight\n\nGiven these difficulties, Starliner's success will be important for Boeing's future space efforts. Even if SpaceX's Dragon can successfully transport NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, the agency needs a backup. And that's where Starliner comes in.\n\nFollowing the Challenger explosion in 1986 and the Columbia shuttle accident in 2003, NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011. The agency was left with few options to get astronauts to and from space. Having a second commercial crew vehicle provider means that NASA will not have to depend on one company or vehicle for space launches as it previously had to.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, if Starliner is successful, it could compete with SpaceX. Though there's no crushing demand for space tourism right now, and Boeing has no plans to market Starliner for tourism anytime soon, competition is important in any market to drive down costs and increase innovation.\n\nMore such competition is likely coming. Sierra Space's Dream Chaser is planning to launch later this year to transport cargo for NASA to the International Space Station. A crewed version of the space plane is also being developed for the next round of NASA's commercial crew program. Blue Origin is working with NASA in this latest round of commercial crew contracts and developing a lunar lander for the Artemis program.\n\nThough SpaceX has made commercial spaceflight look relatively easy, Boeing's rocky experience with Starliner shows just how hard spaceflight continues to be, even for an experienced company.\n\nStarliner is important not just for NASA and Boeing, but to demonstrate that more than one company can find success in the commercial space industry. A successful launch would also give NASA more confidence in the industry's ability to support operations in Earth's orbit while the agency focuses on future missions to the Moon and beyond.", "source": {"uri": "usa.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "INQUIRER.net USA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expendable_launch_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Expendable launch system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://usa.inquirer.net/files/2024/05/boeing.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of unoccupied test flights.\n\nBoeing program manager Mark Nappi wishes Starliner was further along. \"There's no doubt about that, but we're here now.\"\n\nThe company's long-awaited astronaut demo is slated for liftoff Monday night.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nTHE CAPSULE\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed.\n\nTHE CREW\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts. The duo have been involved in the capsule's development and insist Starliner is ready for prime time, otherwise they would not strap in for the launch.\n\n\"We're not putting our heads in the sand,\" Williams told The Associated Press. \"Sure, Boeing has had its problems. But we are the QA (quality assurance). Our eyes are on the spacecraft.\"\n\nTHE TEST FLIGHT\n\nStarliner will blast off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It will be the first time astronauts ride an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Sixty-two years later, this will be the 100th launch of the Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft.\n\n\"We're super careful with every mission. We're super, duper, duper careful\" with human missions, said Tory Bruno, CEO of ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station in roughly 26 hours. The seven station residents will have their eyes peeled on the approaching capsule. The arrival of a new vehicle is \"a really big deal. You leave nothing to chance,\" NASA astronaut Michael Barratt told the AP from orbit. Starliner will remain docked for eight days, undergoing checkouts before landing in New Mexico or elsewhere in the American West.\n\nSTARLINER VS. DRAGON\n\nBoth companies' capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA's Orion capsules for moon missions. Wilmore and Williams briefly will take manual control to wring out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was in the station delivery business and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing will use a more traditional \"astrovan\" equipped with a video screen that Wilmore said will be playing \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\nOne big difference at flight's end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station's planned end in 2030. Boeing's Nappi is reluctant to discuss other potential customers until this inaugural crew flight is over. But the company has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will deliver cargo to the station later this year or next, before accepting passengers.\n\nDownload the FOX13 Memphis app to receive alerts from breaking news in your neighborhood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO

The spacecraft will take off for the International Space Station (ISS) from Canaveral in Florida with Ms Williams and astronaut Butch Wilmore.\n\nHere is all you need to know about the Boeing Starliner:\n\nThe Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is one of two systems aiming to take NASA astronauts to space, with SpaceX's Crew Dragon being the other.\n\nIt is about to make its first voyage with astronauts to and from the International Space Station.\n\nBoeing Starliner Missions\n\nAs per its official page, the CST-100 Starliner has completed two uncrewed flights so far.\n\nDuring its inaugural mission in 2019, the unmanned test flight of the capsule failed to achieve the intended trajectory, resulting in its return without reaching the International Space Station.\n\nThen in 2021, with the rocket on the launch pad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.\n\nThe CST-100 met all of its major objectives in 2022. But issues since then have delayed the crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to get certified for NASA's use on regular International Space Station missions.\n\nSome facts about Boeing Starliner\n\n1. The Starliner, a reusable spacecraft, has a pusher abort system. This allows the crew to safely escape throughout the launch and the ascent phases of the mission.\n\n2. In addition to being software-driven, the Starliner has wireless internet that will help with \"crew communication, entertainment and docking with the International Space Station\"\n\n3. The spacecraft can fly and course-correct on its own. It operates like advanced self-driving cars, with features similar to sophisticated cruise control and hands-free driving, allowing astronauts to simply enjoy the ride without intervention. It also allows astronauts to choose their level of control.\n\nBoeing Starliner Crew\n\nDuring its first crewed test flight, the test craft will carry Navy aviators Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Pilot Sunita \"Suni\" Williams to the ISS. The two will fly on Starliner's 10-day Crew Flight Test mission, or CFT.\n\nWhy Is Mission's Success Important?\n\nAs per the official site, \"This critical step for the program is meant to demonstrate Starliner's launch-to-landing capabilities. The test flight will prove the team's readiness to achieve NASA certification and fly long-duration missions for the agency.\"\n\nIn addition, if all goes as planned, at least three astronauts in 2025 will venture to the ISS for the operational six-month Starliner-1 flight.\n\nWhat Sunita Williams Say About Her Mission\n\nTalking about her third space expedition, the retired US Navy Captain said, \"When I reach the International Space Station, it will be like going back home.\"\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nIn a conversation with NDTV, she also revealed that she will carry a statue of Lord Ganesh with her on the commercial crew flight as \"Ganesh is her good luck charm\".\n\nMs Williams added that she was more spiritual than religious and was happy to have Lord Ganesh with her in outer space.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(naval)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (naval)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outer space"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-05/sfiq7pg_boeing-starliner-reuters_625x300_25_May_22.jpg?ver-20240430.08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Wilmore is the designated commander for Monday's flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary, and the test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually.\n\nWith forecasts calling for a 95% chance of favorable weather conditions, ULA completed a launch readiness review on Friday and gave a \"go\" to proceed toward countdown at Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe launch would mark the first crewed voyage to space using an Atlas rocket since the storied family of Atlas launch vehicles first sent astronauts, including John Glenn, on orbital flights for NASA's Mercury program in the 1960s.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the space station after a flight of about 26 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth early on Wednesday.\n\nWilmore and Williams are expected to remain at the space station for about a week before riding the Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for crewed NASA missions.\n\nSuccess is vital before the Starliner gains final approval to begin routine operational flights under NASA's commercial crew program, providing the space agency its first alternative to sending astronauts to low-Earth orbit from U.S. soil since Elon Musk's SpaceX began doing so in 2020.\n\nThe test flight comes at an especially critical moment for Boeing, whose commercial aircraft unit has endured a succession of safety crises in recent years.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing, beset by years of development setbacks and more than $1.5 billion in cost overruns for the aerospace giant on a $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA.\n\nThe first attempt by Boeing to send an uncrewed Starliner to the space station in 2019 failed due to dozens of software and engineering glitches. A second attempt in 2022 succeeded, paving the way for Monday night's mission.\n\nDepending on the outcome, Starliner is booked to fly at least six more crewed missions to the space station for NASA.\n\nAt a pre-flight briefing with NASA officials on Friday, Boeing vice president Mark Nappi said the company and the space agency were \"in total agreement\" that the Starliner was ready to fly with crew, adding, \"we can't be more confident.\"\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson said. \"That's why we put two test pilots on board.\"", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@indianexpress.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Untitled-design-89.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Tests will be performed to check it is working properly, and then Williams and Wilmore will reboard the capsule to return home.\n\nA successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by the numerous setbacks in the Starliner program.\n\nIn 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, the capsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching the ISS.\n\nThen in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.\n\nThe empty vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022. But problems since then have delayed Monday's crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA's use on regular ISS missions.\n\nNASA associate administrator Jim Free had predicted the mission would not be hiccup-free.\n\n\"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, things we expect to learn, being a test mission. We may encounter things we don't expect,\" Free said, noting that Starliner is just the sixth US-built class of vessel for NASA astronauts.\n\nSpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club in 2020, following the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle programs.\n\nIn 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules.\n\nOnce Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to ferry astronauts to the ISS.\n\nEven though the ISS is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used to taxi humans to future private space stations, which several companies are planning to build.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station_programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (planet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.rtl.lu/sassets/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2024/05/06/07/6482d4fb031414c9fd8dbe83bd2b59b3.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

That brings to bear all the things that the title implies,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention. They're checking out a lot of the systems -- the life support, the manual control, all of those things that you want to be checked out.\n\n\"That's why we put two test pilots on board, and of course the resumes of Butch and Suni are extensive,\" he said.\n\nPictures: Boeing CST-100 Starliner Crew Flight Test astronaut arrival, rocket rollout\n\nBoth astronauts are retired Navy and have flown to space two times previous each, both on the space shuttle and on Russia Soyuz spacecraft with stays on board the ISS. Wilmore is the commander for this flight and joined NASA in 2000. Williams is pilot and joined in 1998.\n\n\"We have been through quite the process over the years,\" said Wilmore on a media call last Wednesday. \"It's been really a thrilling process. I mean, to be two Navy trained test pilots and be into the process of this first flight, and all that goes into that and all the discovery that we've had over the years and working together with our Boeing counterparts, test after test, evaluation after evaluation. Every single day is different, and that's been intriguing, and thrilling along the way.\"\n\nWilliams and Wilmore had been targeting several liftoff dates in 2023 before hardware delays required fixes pushing the attempt into 2024.\n\n\"It almost feels unreal,\" Williams said. \"Like we've had a couple launch dates and we've been like, 'OK, we're ready to go,' but now it's like, heck five, five days... which means it is actually finally real, and I sort of have to pinch myself a little bit to understand we're actually, we're going.\"\n\nAstronauts arrive to KSC as 1st crew for Boeing's Starliner spacecraft\n\nAll teams signed off on the mission at last week's Launch Readiness Review and the Atlas V was rolled to the launch pad on Saturday. Space Launch Delta 45's weather squadron forecasts a 95% chance for good conditions, although NASA has backup opportunities on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"The most exciting thing for me about the Launch Readiness Review was at the very end,\" said NASA Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich. \"We heard from Butch and Suni, and they talked about their excitement. And after everybody had polled go, Butch got on and wanted to say one thing to the team and he said he's go for launch.\"\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program awarded Boeing and SpaceX contracts back in 2014 to build spacecraft capable of flying its astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nStarliner is only the sixth ever U.S.-based spacecraft to fly with NASA astronauts following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle and SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nIt also marks a return of human launches from Cape Canaveral's launch pads, which last saw a crewed flight in 1968 with the launch of Apollo 7. Every Apollo mission afterward as well as the space shuttle and Crew Dragon launches have come from nearby Kennedy Space Center.\n\nIt's the first time an Atlas V will fly with humans as well, although earlier iterations of the Atlas rocket flew several human spaceflights in the early 1960s including John Glenn's historic trip to space as the first American to each orbit in 1962. This also marks the 100th launch of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nStarliner will also become the first U.S.-based capsule to make a land touchdown as Crew Dragon, Apollo, Gemini and Mercury all made water landings, as will the Artemis program's Orion capsule that has yet to fly with humans. Russia's Soyuz, though, features land touchdowns.\n\nDragon and Starliner are NASA's solution to replace the retired Space Shuttle Program that last flew in 2011 and end its reliance on Soyuz that filled the gap as NASA's only option for nearly nine years.\n\nThat's when SpaceX was able to complete its crewed test flight in 2020. Elon Musk's company has since flown its fleet of Crew Dragons 13 times carrying 50 humans to space, including the four members of Crew-8 who await the arrival of Starliner on board the ISS.\n\nThe CFT mission comes nearly two years since Starliner last flew on the Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2), a successful trip to the ISS without a crew, just a mannequin named \"Rosie the Rocketeer.\"\n\nThe first human to ever venture into Starliner in space was actually NASA's Bob Hines, a member of Crew-4 in 2022.\n\n\"Nobody stepped inside. I floated inside,\" he said. \"It was me. I got to open the hatch ... We had agreed early on that as a new guy, this was a good project for me to kind of take on, and so I was the lead for when the Starliner mission was up there on space station.\"\n\nHe is now part of the NASA's joint test team for crews prepping for both SpaceX Dragon and Boeing Starliner, and has been working with the CFT crew leading up to this launch.\n\n\"I got to open the hatch and go in and kind of lead that mission,\" he said. \"It was pretty cool, and it's almost coming full circle here being very involved in getting crew off the ground.\"\n\nHaving flown up to the ISS on Dragon, he took note of the differences between the two capsules.\n\n\"One, it was very obvious that there are different philosophies in approaching human spaceflight, which is really neat to see as a test pilot,\" he said. \"A different cabin layout, a totally different capsule design, a different philosophy for operating the vehicle ... So it was really neat and eye opening to see another solution.\"\n\nBoeing aims for Starliner astronaut launch Monday after delays, $1.5 billion spent\n\nThat mission was a do-over mission from the original uncrewed test flight, now referred to as OFT-1, that in 2019 saw myriad issues including not being able to dock with the ISS. But now nearly four years behind SpaceX, Boeing, which has spent more than $1.5 billion on Starliner's development, looks to finally get its spacecraft certified to perform normal rotational missions to the ISS.\n\n\"It's important that we're making history. I feel that a lot as the Commercial Crew Program manager,\" Stich said. \"It was just four years ago we brought the Dragon spacecraft online and the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, and then here we are now four years later bringing another system online.\"\n\nStich said the years of delay aren't as important as making sure the flight is a safe one.\n\n\"We've been taking our time to go through everything methodically because it is a test flight, and we want it to go well,\" he said. \"I'm sure we'll learn something on orbit and we'll learn something during the flight but our team is checking, double checking everything and making sure we're really ready to go.\"\n\nIf all goes well with CFT, that first operational mission, dubbed Starliner-1, could fly with four astronauts to the ISS as early as next February and become the first of six Boeing missions that would share taxi duties with SpaceX to the station until the ISS is decommissioned after 2030.\n\n\"We have been striving in Commercial Crew to have two independent space transportation systems,\" Stich said. \"That's been our goal since from Commercial Crew's inception and we're very close to reaching that goal.\"",

Starliner will blast off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral in Florida\n\nIt will be the first time astronauts ride an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Sixty-two years later, this will be the 100th launch of the Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft. Notably, 62 years ago, on May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard had became the first American to go to space.\n\nButch Wilmore and Sunita Williams are scheduled to lift off aboard Boeing's Starliner crew where they will stay for about a week.\n\nSpeaking of the two astronauts, Williams, aged 58, is a former Naval test pilot who has flown over 30 different aircraft. She has accumulated 322 days in space over two missions since her initial flight in 2007. Wilmore, aged 61, a retired Navy captain, has spent 178 days in space since his first of two space missions in 2009.\n\nThe mission is the first crewed flight for the Starliner spacecraft. The mission will test the end-to-end capabilities of the Starliner system, including launch, docking, and return to Earth in the western United States. \"Following a successful crewed flight test, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and systems for crewed missions to the space station,\" the US space agency had said.\n\nIn 2019, an attempt to send an uncrewed Starliner to the ISS for a week ended in failure. The mission had to be cut short, with the spacecraft returning to Earth several days earlier than planned, due to numerous software and engineering issues.\n\nBoeing and NASA are targetting the launch at 10:34 p.m. EDT on May 6 which is 4 am IST on May 7 for a week long visit to the ISS.

Both astronauts are retired U.S. Navy captains.\n\n\"I sort of have to pinch myself a little bit to understand we're going,\" shared Williams.\n\nBoeing came up with the idea for the Starliner in 2012 and got a NASA contract four years later. However, setbacks gave SpaceX a private monopoly on low-orbit missions.\n\nPREVIOUS: NASA astronauts arrive in Florida ahead of Boeing Starliner launch to ISS\n\n\"If we could go back the past three years and talk about the capabilities of the spacecraft- what it was then as envisioned and then where it's at now after these discoveries,\" said Wilmore. \"It's really leaps and bounds forward.\"\n\nNow, it's Boeing's time to shine after working through glitches and finally getting its Starliner ready to launch. NASA wants private competition to drive more innovation and possibly bring down launch costs. Also, having another provider would allow for an additional option if the other encounters issues.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are scheduled to launch on the CST-100 Starliner on a ULA Atlas V rocket at 10:34 p.m. on Monday night at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nIt will take the duo about 26 hours to reach the International Space Station (ISS).

This marked a significant shift in NASA's approach, as it moved away from owning space flight hardware and instead began paying private partners for their services.\n\nOnce Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to ferry astronauts to the ISS.\n\nEven though the ISS is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used to taxi humans to future private space stations, which several companies are working on.\n\nla-ia/dw\n\nMore from this section\n\nA look at commencement ceremonies as US campuses are roiled by protests over the Israel-Hamas war Striking deals to end campus protests, some colleges invite discussion of their investments Stack Sports launches Stack Rewards to Save Youth Sports Families $100M", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station_programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/61/261aa674-24f1-5094-8397-c1eb121023a0/6638757767184.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

(Image credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls)\n\nWhen Suni Williams was assigned to fly on board Boeing Starliner flight in 2018, no one anticipated it would be a six-year wait for launch.\n\nThe veteran NASA astronaut and former U.S. Navy test pilot spoke March 22 about the \"emotional rollercoaster\" the Starliner team went through in the years since, through two uncrewed test flights, the pandemic and a host of other technical issues that had to be addressed before safely launching astronauts.\n\nThe years of work in between, though intense, were a \"test pilot's dream\" and are finally coming to fruition. Williams and commander Butch Wilmore are now expected to launch on the 10-day Crew Test Flight no earlier than May 6. \"I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now,\" Williams added.\n\nWilmore and Williams, in fact, were initially assigned to the operational and six-month-long Starliner-1 mission scheduled to fly after CFT. Many other crew swap-outs also happened in the intervening years, but everyone always had confidence in Starliner: \"it's a solid spacecraft,\" Williams told reporters at a press conference here at NASA's Johnson Space Center.\n\nRelated: 1st Boeing Starliner astronauts are ready to launch to the ISS for NASA (exclusive)\n\nBoth Boeing and Space were tasked in 2014 to bring NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard commercial crew spacecraft. SpaceX has been doing so operationally since 2020, while Starliner had to wait to address numerous technical issues. (Boeing, NASA and the astronauts all stress that the relevant problems have been addressed ahead of launch day.)\n\nWhile the spacecraft is certified for an astronaut test flight, the work is not over. CFT is a developmental mission, former Navy test pilot Wilmore stressed at the same press conference. This means the astronauts, their support teams and even the Starliner-1 crew (now expected to launch in 2025) are creating the training program as they're going along. The spacecraft is also continuing to change, if slightly.\n\n\"We are sort of the trailblazers, if you will, getting those training processes in place and developing them,\" Williams told reporters. And that mindset requires, he said a bit later on, looking beyond a \"finish line\" or setting firm dates for any mission milestone.\n\n\"We are trained in flight test, and by the good Lord's allowing, we are now in a position for spaceflight test -- which not a lot of people have had the opportunity to do. And we take that very seriously,\" said Williams. \"So we look at the tasks at hand, the ones that are close or that we're dealing with at the time, (while) also always looking at the long-term mission. So the finish line is not something that I focus on.\"\n\nRelated: Boeing begins fueling Starliner capsule ahead of 1st astronaut launch\n\nWilliams said the years of extra practice have given her confidence that both Boeing and NASA have looked at the small details for their shakedown mission, including adding numerous backups for procedures and systems.\n\nThe spacecraft, for example, could run through all major procedures with no communications. The astronauts can also take over any automatic system during docking or landing to steer Starliner in the right direction, and the team is well-rehearsed on launch aborts and other critical procedures.\n\n\"I feel like we've invested the time\" since the first uncrewed flight test that failed to see Starliner reach the ISS in 2019, Williams said; after all, Starliner made it there on its second try in 2022. The team, she said later in the conference, is \"pretty sharp\" because \"we've gone through this process together.\"\n\n\"We really looked into the spacecraft, and delved into everything that we could know about it, and (added) some changes on things where we thought there needed to be changes,\" she added. \"That's why I think we're ready to go, because we have been part of ... that developmental process. It wasn't quite done, and we noticed that, and we've worked to make sure now it's done. It's ready.\"\n\nWith the years of training starting to close, Wilmore said he is allowing himself to think about the emotions of launch day. \"I'm looking forward to walking to the pad, and the launch,\" he said, adding, \"It's a great seat to be in.\"\n\nWilliams added she wants to pinch herself at the prospect of her first spaceflight in a dozen years, since launching on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2012. (Wilmore's last flight was almost as long ago, in 2015.) While the crew is not quite aboard CFT yet, she said entering quarantine will make it feel more real.\n\n\"That's sort of getting to be it, and then it's all icing on the cake. By that time, pretty much everything's done,\" Williams said of quarantine. After launch, there's also a familiar sight to look forward to: \"I really cannot wait 'til we see space station through the window. That will be super cool.\"", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZtHtyv5n8RKTbxT8HWy7ob-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-22", "textStart": 410, "textEnd": 418}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 875, "textEnd": 880}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams will pilot the Starliner on its inaugural crewed flight -- a crucial final test before NASA can authorize Boeing to conduct routine flights to and from the space station for the agency.The stakes are high. This will be Boeing's first launch with humans aboard its spaceship, and it comes after years of delays, technical setbacks and significant budget overruns. If successful, the flight will enable Boeing to challenge the dominance held by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has been ferrying NASA astronauts to and from the orbiting outpost since 2020.Both companies' spacecraft were developed under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which was established after its space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. The goal: incentivize and help fund the creation of new, commercially built vehicles capable of flying to and from low-Earth orbit.At a preflight briefing last week, Wilmore said safety is paramount and that previous Starliner launch attempts -- both uncrewed and crewed -- were delayed because the capsule simply was not ready until now.\"Why do we think it's as safe as possible? We wouldn't be standing here if we didn't,\" Wilmore told reporters.Still, there are inherent risks with any new spacecraft or rocket.\"Do we expect it to go perfectly? This is the first human flight of the spacecraft,\" Wilmore said. \"I'm sure we'll find things out. That's why we do this. This is a test flight.\"Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. (Robert Markowitz / NASA)The plan is for the astronauts to dock with the space station the following day and spend about a week there before returning to Earth and touching down at Starliner's primary landing site in New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range.While NASA astronauts have for years been flying aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, the agency does not want to rely on a single company, said Makena Young, a fellow with the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.\"Having that second option is really important because it adds redundancy and resiliency,\" Young said. \"In space systems, there are always redundancies, because if something goes wrong, you want to make sure that you have backups.\"The Boeing CST-100 Starliner spacecraft (Frank Michaux / NASA)Boeing's journey to this first crewed flight has been turbulent.

The flight, if it succeeds, will become the second private firm being able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS.\n\nThe launch is scheduled to take place on 10:34 p.m. EDT Monday, May 6, ie May 7 at 8.04 am Indian Standard Time.\n\nBoeing's competitor Elon Musk's SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in the year 2020. It has sent 12 crewed missions to the ISS since 2020. After a botched attempt in December 2019, Starliner made a successful second uncrewed test flight in May 2022.\n\nWilliams, 59, a retired US Navy captain and Wilmore will pilot the flight, which Boeing is calling its Crew Flight Test (CFT) and that will be docked with the ISS for about a week. The Starliner flight to the ISS is expected to last about 26 hours, and the two astronauts will live and work on the ISS for 8 days before undocking and returning to Earth on May 15.\n\nDuring the test flight, the astronaut duo will take the Starliner through a series of tests before NASA certifies it to be fit to fly to space on rotational missions to the ISS under the US space agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nUnlike previous US capsules that splashed down in the sea on returning to Earth, the Starliner will touch down on land at a site somewhere in the western part of the United States, NASA said.\n\nBoth the astronoauts will be launching on a United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore were both former commanders of the International Space Station.\n\nWilliams, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology. Her first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007) launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Station, according to NASA.\n\nWhile onboard, Williams established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Williams has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks.\n\nWilliams worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old, Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.\n\nBoeing has planned six manned missions for the platform over the next six years, the projected end of the ISS' operating lifespan.\n\nNASA plans to use both SpaceX's Dragon and Boeing's Starliner to send up astronauts at least every six months from US soil. Both Boeing and SpaceX were given the responsibility in 2014 by NASA to send commercial crew missions to the ISS.\n\nBoeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about USD 2.6 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, India has its own human spaceflight program, the Gaganyaan led by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It envisages demonstration of human spaceflight capability by launching crew of 3 members to an orbit of 400 km for a 3 days mission and bring them back safely to earth, by landing in Indian sea waters.\n\nEarlier in February this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the names of the four astronauts who will be part of Gaganyaan, slated to be launched in 2024-25.\n\nThe four chosen Indian Air Force pilots - Group Captain Prashanth Nair, Group Captain Ajit Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap, and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla- were trained at Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Russia.

This final test flight will comprise validation of the transportation system, including launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operational capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard.\n\nWilliams gave the crew capsule the nickname \"Calypso\" back in 2019 to pay tribute to the explorer Jacques Cousteau. The icon of ocean travel sailed his own ship around the world, and Williams believes Starliner can do the same for space. The spacecraft itself has a diameter of 15-feet, and can carry up to four astronauts, or a mix of crew and cargo.\n\nThis will be the third test flight of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, following an Orbital Flight Test, and an uncrewed mission to ISS in May of 2022. The space and airliner company also completed a pad abort demonstration in November 2019.\n\nAccording to NASA, the Starliner spacecraft can fly autonomously, or be steered manually. The crew and spacecraft are expected to dock with ISS on May 8. Once the flight test is completed, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nCoverage of the launch can be viewed via the YouTube video feed above, or by visiting the NASA+ website. As of the time of this writing, the launch is scheduled for 10:34am EDT.

Weather conditions are 95 percent favorable for launch.\n\nStarliner will be propelled into orbit by an Atlas V rocket made by United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture.\n\nOnce in space, the crew will take the helm, manually piloting the craft in a crucial test.\n\nThe astronauts, both Navy-trained space program veterans, have each been to the ISS twice, traveling once on a shuttle and then aboard a Russian Soyuz vessel. \"It's going to be like going back home,\" Williams said ahead of the launch.\n\n\"(Safe) travels, star sailors,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson tweeted. \"You are the pride of our great nation.\"\n\nHiccups expected\n\nStarliner is scheduled to rendezvous with the ISS at about 0500 GMT Wednesday, kicking off a week-long stay. Tests will be performed to check if the capsule is working properly, and then Williams and Wilmore will reboard it to return home.\n\nA successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by numerous setbacks in the Starliner program.\n\nIn 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, the capsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching the ISS.\n\n\"Two critical software defects were not detected ahead of flight despite multiple safeguards. Ground intervention prevented loss of vehicle in both cases,\" said NASA in the aftermath, chiding Boeing for inadequate safety checks.\n\nThen in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.\n\nThe empty vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022. But problems since then -- including weak parachutes and flammable tape in the cabin that needed to be removed -- caused further delays to the crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA use on regular ISS missions.\n\nNASA associate administrator Jim Free had predicted the mission would not be hiccup-free.\n\n\"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, things we expect to learn, being a test mission. We may encounter things we don't expect,\" Free said, noting that Starliner is just the sixth US-built class of vessel for NASA astronauts.\n\nExclusive club\n\nSpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club in 2020, following the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.\n\nThe last shuttle flew in 2011, leaving NASA astronauts reliant on Russian Soyuz rockets for rides to the orbital outpost.\n\nIn 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules under its Commercial Crew Program. This marked a significant shift in NASA's approach, as it moved away from owning space flight hardware and instead began paying private partners for their services.\n\nOnce Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to ferry astronauts to the ISS.\n\nEven though the ISS is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used to taxi humans to future private space stations, which several companies are working on.", "source": {"uri": "thepeninsulaqatar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peninsula"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station_programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 80}], "image": "http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/get/maximage/20240506_1715008120-650.jpeg?1715008120", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

A decade after NASA awarded Boeing a contract to fly astronauts to the International Space Station, the craft is set to lift off Monday with two astronauts. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nBefore a door-size panel blew out of a Boeing 737 Max, leaving a gaping hole in the side of an Alaska Airlines aircraft shortly after takeoff; before whistleblowers came forward to say they were threatened for bringing up safety issues at the company; and before the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into the blowout incident, Boeing was struggling with another set of issues, on another high-profile vehicle.\n\nIts Starliner spacecraft, designed to fly astronauts to orbit under a $4.2 billion contract from NASA, had suffered a series of problems that put its launch with astronauts years behind schedule. Its onboard computer had failed during its first test flight. A second test flight was scrubbed after valves in the vehicle's service module stuck and wouldn't operate. Then, after the craft finally flew a test mission successfully without anyone on board, Boeing discovered that tape used as insulation on wiring inside the capsule was flammable and would need to be removed. The parachute system also had problems, which forced the company to redesign and strengthen a link between the parachutes and the spacecraft.\n\nNow, a decade after NASA awarded Boeing a contract to fly astronauts to the International Space Station, Boeing will finally attempt to fly its Starliner spacecraft with people onboard. If all goes to plan, at 10:34 p.m. on Monday, the company is set to fly a pair of veteran astronauts, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, on a mission that will be one of the most significant tests for Boeing's space division -- and for NASA -- in years.\n\nThe flight is intended to see how the spacecraft performs in space with a crew onboard. If all goes well, the spacecraft will catch up with the space station -- which travels at 17,500 mph -- about a day after lifting off. Along the way, the crew members will test manually flying the spacecraft before it docks autonomously with the station. NASA and Boeing will also be eager to see how the spacecraft's heat shield and parachutes work as it brings Williams and Wilmore back to Earth after about eight days.\n\nNASA officials express confidence in Boeing and say the company has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the mission will be successful. They are eager to have another spacecraft, in addition to the one SpaceX flies, that can ferry astronauts to the station. \"I can say with confidence that the teams have absolutely done their due diligence,\" James Free, NASA's associate administrator, said at a briefing last week.\n\n\"I see a total focus on this mission and making it successful from the way that we always have done human spaceflight in my time at NASA,\" said Steve Stich, who oversees NASA's commercial crew program. \"It's really just taking it step by step, methodically getting to flight.\"\n\nStill, launching humans to orbit is extremely difficult and dangerous, especially on a new vehicle that has a history of trouble and has never flown people before.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone'\" Free said. \"The lives of our crew members, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all. The most important thing we can do is protect those two people, as well as our crew currently on board the space station.\"\n\nSafety, he said, \"has and always will be our primary core value at NASA.\"\n\nThe mission comes at a crucial time for Boeing. After the panel blew off the Alaska Airlines flight, the company announced it would reshuffle its leadership and replace CEO David Calhoun. Calhoun took over the company after another disaster -- the crashes of two 737 Max airplanes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nBoeing's commercial aviation division and its space program are managed separately. But both have faced similar quality-control issues.\n\nAfter the failure of Starliner's first test flight, managers at Boeing acknowledged they had cut short a test that would have caught the software problem. That caused NASA to offer an unusually harsh assessment of its partner, saying that \"there were numerous instances where the Boeing software quality processes either should have or could have uncovered the defects.\"\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program manager, told reporters the past week that the problems with the company's airline division had not added to pressures in the mission.\n\n\"We signed up to go do this, and we're going to go do it and be successful at it,\" he said. \"So I don't think of it in terms of what's important for Boeing, as much as I think of it in terms of what's important for this program, to follow through with the commitments that we made to our customer.\"\n\nBoeing's woes have been amplified by the fact that SpaceX has been flying astronauts on its spacecraft for four years, even though the companies received their contracts at the same time and SpaceX was paid $2.6 billion, far less than Boeing. Since then, SpaceX has flown multiple missions for NASA, as well as taken private astronauts to the station and to orbit. It also has received an extension on its contract with NASA to fly astronaut missions.\n\nNot only has Boeing yet to fly people on Starliner but the delays have meant about $1.4 billion in cost overruns. In an interview last year, John Shannon, vice president of Boeing Exploration Systems, said the future of Starliner was uncertain. \"Probably the biggest challenge I have is defining how do I make this into a positive business case, given the market conditions as we see them right now,\" he said then.\n\nAsked about the future of Starliner recently, Nappi was noncommittal. He said the company would fulfill its contract with NASA, flying a handful of missions, which would take the company to the end of the decade.\n\n\"So we've got plenty of time to think about what's after that,\" he said. \"And we will do that. But right now, the focus is on CFT\" -- or the crewed flight test.\n\nIn December 2019, Starliner launched successfully to orbit, but the spacecraft ran into problems shortly after it separated from the launch vehicle. Engineers on the ground were able to diagnose the problem -- the onboard computer was 11 hours off, so the spacecraft had started executing commands for an entirely different part of the flight.\n\nEngineers also soon discovered a second software problem, which could have caused the service module to crash into the crew capsule during separation. The issues were so severe that NASA officials said the spacecraft could have been lost because of either of them, threatening the lives of astronauts, had any been on board. The flight never reached the space station, and after it returned to Earth, Boeing said it would attempt a second flight test after reviewing 1 million lines of code in the spacecraft.\n\nThe second attempt to fly the capsule without anyone onboard came about a year and a half later, during the summer of 2021. By then, Boeing said it had fixed the software issues. But this time several of the valves in the spacecraft's service module were corroded shut, and Boeing was unable to fix them while the craft was mounted on top of the rocket at the launchpad.\n\nTaking it down led to another delay.\n\nBoeing finally completed the uncrewed test flight in May 2022. But a little over a year later, as it was gearing up to fly astronauts, it announced the problem with the parachute system and the flammable tape.\n\nPart of the purpose of the crewed test flight is to see how the vehicle reacts in the vacuum of space, and NASA officials said they anticipate that the astronauts and ground controllers will have to react to unexpected issues. That, they said, is how they make the vehicle safer and more reliable.\n\n\"Let me just remind everybody again: This is a new spacecraft. I'll also remind you this is a test flight,\" Free said. \"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, things we expect to learn.

Tests will be performed to check it is working properly, and then Williams and Wilmore will reboard the capsule to return home.\n\nMore from this section King Frederik and Queen Mary give first interview amid Danish royal photoshop controversy Britons issued urgent warning of massive fines for breaking driving laws and splashing pedestrians NY: Padma Lakshmi visits the Empire State Building - 52951092\n\nA successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by the numerous setbacks in the Starliner program.\n\nIn 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, the capsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching the ISS.\n\nThen in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.\n\nThe empty vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022. But problems since then have delayed Monday's crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA's use on regular ISS missions.\n\nNASA associate administrator Jim Free had predicted the mission would not be hiccup-free.\n\n\"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, things we expect to learn, being a test mission. We may encounter things we don't expect,\" Free said, noting that Starliner is just the sixth US-built class of vessel for NASA astronauts.\n\nSpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club in 2020, following the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle programs.\n\nIn 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules.\n\nOnce Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to ferry astronauts to the ISS.\n\nEven though the ISS is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used to taxi humans to future private space stations, which several companies are planning to build.\n\nla/bpe/nro/caw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

That brings to bear all the things that the title implies,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention. They're checking out a lot of the systems -- the life support, the manual control, all of those things that you want to be checked out.\n\n\"That's why we put two test pilots on board, and of course the resumes of Butch and Suni are extensive,\" he said.\n\nBoth astronauts are retired Navy and have flown to space two times previous each, both on the space shuttle and on Russia Soyuz spacecraft with stays on board the ISS. Wilmore is the commander for this flight and joined NASA in 2000. Williams is pilot and joined in 1998.\n\n\"We have been through quite the process over the years,\" said Wilmore on a media call last Wednesday. \"It's been really a thrilling process. I mean, to be two Navy trained test pilots and be into the process of this first flight, and all that goes into that and all the discovery that we've had over the years and working together with our Boeing counterparts, test after test, evaluation after evaluation. Every single day is different, and that's been intriguing, and thrilling along the way.\"\n\nWilliams and Wilmore had been targeting several liftoff dates in 2023 before hardware delays required fixes pushing the attempt into 2024.\n\n\"It almost feels unreal,\" Williams said. \"Like we've had a couple launch dates and we've been like, 'OK, we're ready to go,' but now it's like, heck five, five days... which means it is actually finally real, and I sort of have to pinch myself a little bit to understand we're actually, we're going.\"\n\nAll teams signed off on the mission at last week's Launch Readiness Review and the Atlas V was rolled to the launch pad on Saturday. Space Launch Delta 45's weather squadron forecasts a 95% chance for good conditions, although NASA has backup opportunities on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"The most exciting thing for me about the Launch Readiness Review was at the very end,\" said NASA Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich. \"We heard from Butch and Suni, and they talked about their excitement. And after everybody had polled go, Butch got on and wanted to say one thing to the team and he said he's go for launch.\"\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program awarded Boeing and SpaceX contracts back in 2014 to build spacecraft capable of flying its astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nStarliner is only the sixth ever U.S.-based spacecraft to fly with NASA astronauts following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle and SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nIt also marks a return of human launches from Cape Canaveral's launch pads, which last saw a crewed flight in 1968 with the launch of Apollo 7. Every Apollo mission afterward as well as the space shuttle and Crew Dragon launches have come from nearby Kennedy Space Center.\n\nIt's the first time an Atlas V will fly with humans as well, although earlier iterations of the Atlas rocket flew several human spaceflights in the early 1960s including John Glenn's historic trip to space as the first American to each orbit in 1962. This also marks the 100th launch of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nStarliner will also become the first U.S.-based capsule to make a land touchdown as Crew Dragon, Apollo, Gemini and Mercury all made water landings, as will the Artemis program's Orion capsule that has yet to fly with humans. Russia's Soyuz, though, features land touchdowns.\n\nDragon and Starliner are NASA's solution to replace the retired Space Shuttle Program that last flew in 2011 and end its reliance on Soyuz that filled the gap as NASA's only option for nearly nine years.\n\nThat's when SpaceX was able to complete its crewed test flight in 2020. Elon Musk's company has since flown its fleet of Crew Dragons 13 times carrying 50 humans to space, including the four members of Crew-8 who await the arrival of Starliner on board the ISS.\n\nThe CFT mission comes nearly two years since Starliner last flew on the Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2), a successful trip to the ISS without a crew, just a mannequin named \"Rosie the Rocketeer.\"\n\nThe first human to ever venture into Starliner in space was actually NASA's Bob Hines, a member of Crew-4 in 2022.\n\n\"Nobody stepped inside. I floated inside,\" he said. \"It was me. I got to open the hatch ... We had agreed early on that as a new guy, this was a good project for me to kind of take on, and so I was the lead for when the Starliner mission was up there on space station.\"\n\nHe is now part of the NASA's joint test team for crews prepping for both SpaceX Dragon and Boeing Starliner, and has been working with the CFT crew leading up to this launch.\n\n\"I got to open the hatch and go in and kind of lead that mission,\" he said. \"It was pretty cool, and it's almost coming full circle here being very involved in getting crew off the ground.\"\n\nHaving flown up to the ISS on Dragon, he took note of the differences between the two capsules.\n\n\"One, it was very obvious that there are different philosophies in approaching human spaceflight, which is really neat to see as a test pilot,\" he said. \"A different cabin layout, a totally different capsule design, a different philosophy for operating the vehicle ... So it was really neat and eye opening to see another solution.\"\n\nThat mission was a do-over mission from the original uncrewed test flight, now referred to as OFT-1, that in 2019 saw myriad issues including not being able to dock with the ISS. But now nearly four years behind SpaceX, Boeing, which has spent more than $1.5 billion on Starliner's development, looks to finally get its spacecraft certified to perform normal rotational missions to the ISS.\n\n\"It's important that we're making history. I feel that a lot as the Commercial Crew Program manager,\" Stich said. \"It was just four years ago we brought the Dragon spacecraft online and the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, and then here we are now four years later bringing another system online.\"\n\nStich said the years of delay aren't as important as making sure the flight is a safe one.\n\n\"We've been taking our time to go through everything methodically because it is a test flight, and we want it to go well,\" he said. \"I'm sure we'll learn something on orbit and we'll learn something during the flight but our team is checking, double checking everything and making sure we're really ready to go.\"\n\nIf all goes well with CFT, that first operational mission, dubbed Starliner-1, could fly with four astronauts to the ISS as early as next February and become the first of six Boeing missions that would share taxi duties with SpaceX to the station until the ISS is decommissioned after 2030.\n\n\"We have been striving in Commercial Crew to have two independent space transportation systems,\" Stich said. \"That's been our goal since from Commercial Crew's inception and we're very close to reaching that goal.\"",

The project is running years behind schedule.\n\nNASA turned to U.S. companies for astronaut rides after the space shuttles were retired. Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of unoccupied test flights.\n\nIf Monday's launch goes well, NASA can alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\n[SHARE YOUR LAUNCH PHOTOS!]\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed.\n\nAfter the launch, Starliner should reach the space station in roughly 26 hours.

Its onboard computer had failed during its first test flight. A second test flight was scrubbed after valves in the vehicle's service module stuck and wouldn't operate. Then, after the craft finally flew a test mission successfully without anyone on board, Boeing discovered that tape used as insulation on wiring inside the capsule was flammable and would need to be removed. The parachute system also had problems, which forced the company to redesign and strengthen a link between the parachutes and the spacecraft.\n\nNow, a decade after NASA awarded Boeing a contract to fly astronauts to the International Space Station, Boeing will finally attempt to fly its Starliner spacecraft with people onboard. If all goes to plan, at 10:34 p.m. on Monday, the company is set to fly a pair of veteran astronauts, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, on a mission that will be one of the most significant tests for Boeing's space division - and for NASA - in years.\n\nWilliams, a 58-year-old helicopter pilot from Needham and namesake of one of her hometown's elementary schools, told The Associated Press that she and Wilmore have been involved in the capsule's development, so they have faith that Starliner is ready for lift off.\n\n\"We're not putting our heads in the sand,\" Williams told the AP. \"Sure, Boeing has had its problems. But we are the QA (quality assurance). Our eyes are on the spacecraft.\"\n\nThe flight is intended to see how the spacecraft performs in space with a crew onboard. If all goes well, the spacecraft will catch up with the space station - which travels at 17,500 mph - about a day after lifting off. Along the way, the crew members will test manually flying the spacecraft before it docks autonomously with the station. NASA and Boeing will also be eager to see how the spacecraft's heat shield and parachutes work as it brings Williams and Wilmore back to Earth after about eight days.\n\nNASA officials express confidence in Boeing and say the company has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the mission will be successful. They are eager to have another spacecraft, in addition to the one SpaceX flies, that can ferry astronauts to the station. \"I can say with confidence that the teams have absolutely done their due diligence,\" James Free, NASA's associate administrator, said at a briefing last week.\n\n\"I see a total focus on this mission and making it successful from the way that we always have done human spaceflight in my time at NASA,\" said Steve Stich, who oversees NASA's commercial crew program. \"It's really just taking it step by step, methodically getting to flight.\"\n\nStill, launching humans to orbit is extremely difficult and dangerous, especially on a new vehicle that has a history of trouble and has never flown people before.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone'\" Free said. \"The lives of our crew members, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all. The most important thing we can do is protect those two people, as well as our crew currently on board the space station.\"\n\nSafety, he said, \"has and always will be our primary core value at NASA.\"\n\nThe mission comes at a crucial time for Boeing. After the panel blew off the Alaska Airlines flight, the company announced it would reshuffle its leadership and replace CEO David Calhoun. Calhoun took over the company after another disaster - the crashes of two 737 Max airplanes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nBoeing's commercial aviation division and its space program are managed separately. But both have faced similar quality-control issues.\n\nAfter the failure of Starliner's first test flight, managers at Boeing acknowledged they had cut short a test that would have caught the software problem. That caused NASA to offer an unusually harsh assessment of its partner, saying that \"there were numerous instances where the Boeing software quality processes either should have or could have uncovered the defects.\"\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program manager, told reporters the past week that the problems with the company's airline division had not added to pressures in the mission.\n\n\"We signed up to go do this, and we're going to go do it and be successful at it,\" he said. \"So I don't think of it in terms of what's important for Boeing, as much as I think of it in terms of what's important for this program, to follow through with the commitments that we made to our customer.\"\n\nBoeing's woes have been amplified by the fact that SpaceX has been flying astronauts on its spacecraft for four years, even though the companies received their contracts at the same time and SpaceX was paid $2.6 billion, far less than Boeing. Since then, SpaceX has flown multiple missions for NASA, as well as taken private astronauts to the station and to orbit. It also has received an extension on its contract with NASA to fly astronaut missions.\n\nNot only has Boeing yet to fly people on Starliner but the delays have meant about $1.4 billion in cost overruns. In an interview last year, John Shannon, vice president of Boeing Exploration Systems, said the future of Starliner was uncertain. \"Probably the biggest challenge I have is defining how do I make this into a positive business case, given the market conditions as we see them right now,\" he said then.\n\nAsked about the future of Starliner recently, Nappi was noncommittal. He said the company would fulfill its contract with NASA, flying a handful of missions, which would take the company to the end of the decade.\n\n\"So we've got plenty of time to think about what's after that,\" he said. \"And we will do that. But right now, the focus is on CFT\"- or the crewed flight test.\n\nIn December 2019, Starliner launched successfully to orbit, but the spacecraft ran into problems shortly after it separated from the launch vehicle. Engineers on the ground were able to diagnose the problem - the onboard computer was 11 hours off, so the spacecraft had started executing commands for an entirely different part of the flight.\n\nEngineers also soon discovered a second software problem, which could have caused the service module to crash into the crew capsule during separation. The issues were so severe that NASA officials said the spacecraft could have been lost because of either of them, threatening the lives of astronauts, had any been on board. The flight never reached the space station, and after it returned to Earth, Boeing said it would attempt a second flight test after reviewing 1 million lines of code in the spacecraft.\n\nThe second attempt to fly the capsule without anyone onboard came about a year and a half later, during the summer of 2021. By then, Boeing said it had fixed the software issues. But this time several of the valves in the spacecraft's service module were corroded shut, and Boeing was unable to fix them while the craft was mounted on top of the rocket at the launchpad.\n\nBoeing finally completed the uncrewed test flight in May 2022. But a little over a year later, as it was gearing up to fly astronauts, it announced the problem with the parachute system and the flammable tape.\n\nPart of the purpose of the crewed test flight is to see how the vehicle reacts in the vacuum of space, and NASA officials said they anticipate that the astronauts and ground controllers will have to react to unexpected issues. That, they said, is how they make the vehicle safer and more reliable.\n\n\"Let me just remind everybody again: This is a new spacecraft. I'll also remind you this is a test flight,\" Free said. \"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, things we expect to learn. This being a test mission, we may encounter things we don't expect. But our job now is to remain vigilant and keep looking for issues.\"\n\nWilliams, who was assigned years ago to the commercial crew program and has been waiting to fly since then, said she's convinced the teams are ready.\n\n\"We do anticipate everything's going to go as planned,\" she said in an interview. \"But if it doesn't, we'll take a moment and analyze it and talk about it, and we'll be okay. So our confidence in the mission is high.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal insulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/boeing-starliner_HR5ZEGGWZYI6ZPQXFBQWJF2MKQ-6637d5d29d4c5-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 6370, "textEnd": 6383}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Alongside fellow NASA veteran Butch Wilmore, Sunita Williams will undertake the first crewed test flight of the Starliner, destined for the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nScheduled to lift off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the mission marks a significant milestone for Boeing, positioning it as the second private entity capable of shuttling crews to and from the ISS. Launch is set for Monday, May 6, at 10:34 p.m. EDT (May 7 at 8:04 a.m. Indian Standard Time).\n\nWhile SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, achieved a crew flight test in 2020 and has since completed numerous missions to the ISS, Boeing's Starliner faced setbacks, including a failed attempt in December 2019 before a successful uncrewed test flight in May 2022.\n\nPiloted by Sunita Williams and Wilmore, the Starliner's Crew Flight Test (CFT) will dock with the ISS for approximately a week, with the astronauts slated to spend 8 days aboard the station before returning to Earth on May 15. This test flight will subject the Starliner to rigorous evaluations by NASA to certify it for future rotational missions to the ISS under the Commercial Crew Programme.\n\nNotably, the Starliner will touch down on land in the western United States, differing from previous capsules that splashed down in the sea upon re-entry.\n\nSunita Williams, a retired US Navy captain, holds a distinguished record in space exploration, including a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks during her Expedition 14/15 mission. Selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998, she has accumulated 322 days in space across two missions.\n\nWilmore, aged 61, brings his own expertise to the mission, having logged 178 days in space and completed four spacewalks.\n\nBoeing envisions six manned missions for the Starliner platform over the next six years, aligning with NASA's plans to send astronauts to the ISS every six months from US soil. Both SpaceX's Dragon and Boeing's Starliner were tasked by NASA in 2014 to conduct commercial crew missions to the ISS, with Boeing receiving over USD 4 billion in federal funds for Starliner's development.", "source": {"uri": "ptcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "PTC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expedition 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guinness World Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://media.ptcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1b485d08526b19b9ebd189bb67589fb0_1280X720.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 599, "textEnd": 604}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 625, "textEnd": 630}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1143, "textEnd": 1149}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 855, "textEnd": 868}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

This mission will be key to proving that Boeing can transport humans safely to space.\n\n\"The lives of our crew members, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all,\" Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator, said in a recent news conference. \"The most important thing we can do is protect those two people as well as our crew currently on board the space station.\"\n\nRead More: Boeing's Starliner Is Too Late to the Game: Business of Space\n\nStarliner's inaugural human spaceflight, carrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station, has taken on greater significance as Boeing navigates a leadership shake-up spawned by a safety crisis with its 737 Max 9 jet business. A successful space mission would show Boeing can overcome engineering and quality challenges.\n\nBoeing and Elon Musk's SpaceX were each first awarded contracts by NASA in 2014 to create private vehicles to take astronauts to the ISS. SpaceX has been regularly ferrying passengers on its Crew Dragon since 2020.\n\nAfter Boeing's first uncrewed mission in 2019 failed to reach the ISS as planned due to a software glitch, a second attempt was delayed after a series of corroded valves wouldn't open properly. It took until 2022 for an uncrewed Starliner to first reach the space station.\n\nBoeing has reported around $1.5 billion in extra costs to cover Starliner delays and technical problems, and NASA called on the company to overhaul its design processes, testing and communications throughout development. But now the space agency's safety watchdogs have determined that the program appears to be on track.\n\nNASA has appropriate procedures \"to address the challenges of this crewed flight of the Starliner,\" Susan Helms, chair of NASA's aerospace safety advisory panel and a former astronaut, said ahead of the flight.\n\nWhile this test is largely focused on Starliner, this will also be the first time that a ULA rocket carries humans to space. ULA's Atlas V rocket has had 99 previous successful launches. Boeing is also one of two parent companies of ULA, along with rival Lockheed Martin Corp., though the companies continue to weigh offloading their stake in the Pentagon contractor, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nNo matter what happens with this launch, Boeing faces questions about the long-term vision for its space business.\n\nThe company's space lineage stretches back more than 50 years to the iconic Saturn V that first sent men to the moon. The firm also builds NASA's Space Launch System rocket and maintains the ISS. Yet in the last decade it has fallen far behind the big technology leaps made by SpaceX and other \"new space\" firms.\n\nIt's unclear whether Starliner will be used beyond a half-dozen more missions to the ISS for NASA. Late last year, Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West told a small gathering of investors that the company has a decision to make about future investment in the program, according to a person with direct knowledge of his comments who declined to be named because the meeting was private.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson said the company has made significant investments in Starliner and will continue to fulfill its contractual obligations to NASA.\n\nIn addition, while Boeing's Space Launch System rocket is a cornerstone of NASA's next moonshot later this decade, it's expected to cost about $2 billion per launch. SpaceX says it's working on cheaper alternatives. And the ISS is heading toward retirement.\n\nBoeing burned through $3.9 billion in the first quarter of this year as it worked to restore confidence in production of its 737 aircraft. Among other challenges, the company's next chief executive officer and its board will need to decide how big a priority its space business should be.\n\nNew from Bloomberg: Get the Business of Space newsletter, a weekly look at the inside stories of investments beyond Earth.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 72}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2069188!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Its onboard computer had failed during its first test flight. A second test flight was scrubbed after valves in the vehicle's service module stuck and wouldn't operate. Then, after the craft finally flew a test mission successfully without anyone on board, Boeing discovered that tape used as insulation on wiring inside the capsule was flammable and would need to be removed. The parachute system also had problems, which forced the company to redesign and strengthen a link between the parachutes and the spacecraft.\n\nNow, a decade after NASA awarded Boeing a contract to fly astronauts to the International Space Station, Boeing will finally attempt to fly its Starliner spacecraft with people onboard. If all goes to plan, at 10:34 p.m. on Monday, the company is set to fly a pair of veteran astronauts, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, on a mission that will be one of the most significant tests for Boeing's space division - and for NASA - in years.\n\nThe flight is intended to see how the spacecraft performs in space with a crew onboard. If all goes well, the spacecraft will catch up with the space station - which travels at 17,500 mph - about a day after lifting off. Along the way, the crew members will test manually flying the spacecraft before it docks autonomously with the station. NASA and Boeing will also be eager to see how the spacecraft's heat shield and parachutes work as it brings Williams and Wilmore back to Earth after about eight days.\n\nNASA officials express confidence in Boeing and say the company has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the mission will be successful. They are eager to have another spacecraft, in addition to the one SpaceX flies, that can ferry astronauts to the station. \"I can say with confidence that the teams have absolutely done their due diligence,\" James Free, NASA's associate administrator, said at a briefing last week.\n\n\"I see a total focus on this mission and making it successful from the way that we always have done human spaceflight in my time at NASA,\" said Steve Stich, who oversees NASA's commercial crew program. \"It's really just taking it step by step, methodically getting to flight.\"\n\nStill, launching humans to orbit is extremely difficult and dangerous, especially on a new vehicle that has a history of trouble and has never flown people before.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone'\" Free said. \"The lives of our crew members, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all. The most important thing we can do is protect those two people, as well as our crew currently on board the space station.\"\n\nSafety, he said, \"has and always will be our primary core value at NASA.\"\n\nThe mission comes at a crucial time for Boeing. After the panel blew off the Alaska Airlines flight, the company announced it would reshuffle its leadership and replace CEO David Calhoun. Calhoun took over the company after another disaster - the crashes of two 737 Max airplanes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nBoeing's commercial aviation division and its space program are managed separately. But both have faced similar quality-control issues.\n\nAfter the failure of Starliner's first test flight, managers at Boeing acknowledged they had cut short a test that would have caught the software problem. That caused NASA to offer an unusually harsh assessment of its partner, saying that \"there were numerous instances where the Boeing software quality processes either should have or could have uncovered the defects.\"\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program manager, told reporters the past week that the problems with the company's airline division had not added to pressures in the mission.\n\n\"We signed up to go do this, and we're going to go do it and be successful at it,\" he said. \"So I don't think of it in terms of what's important for Boeing, as much as I think of it in terms of what's important for this program, to follow through with the commitments that we made to our customer.\"\n\nBoeing's woes have been amplified by the fact that SpaceX has been flying astronauts on its spacecraft for four years, even though the companies received their contracts at the same time and SpaceX was paid $2.6 billion, far less than Boeing. Since then, SpaceX has flown multiple missions for NASA, as well as taken private astronauts to the station and to orbit. It also has received an extension on its contract with NASA to fly astronaut missions.\n\nNot only has Boeing yet to fly people on Starliner but the delays have meant about $1.4 billion in cost overruns. In an interview last year, John Shannon, vice president of Boeing Exploration Systems, said the future of Starliner was uncertain. \"Probably the biggest challenge I have is defining how do I make this into a positive business case, given the market conditions as we see them right now,\" he said then.\n\nAsked about the future of Starliner recently, Nappi was noncommittal. He said the company would fulfill its contract with NASA, flying a handful of missions, which would take the company to the end of the decade.\n\n\"So we've got plenty of time to think about what's after that,\" he said. \"And we will do that. But right now, the focus is on CFT\"- or the crewed flight test.\n\nIn December 2019, Starliner launched successfully to orbit, but the spacecraft ran into problems shortly after it separated from the launch vehicle. Engineers on the ground were able to diagnose the problem - the onboard computer was 11 hours off, so the spacecraft had started executing commands for an entirely different part of the flight.\n\nEngineers also soon discovered a second software problem, which could have caused the service module to crash into the crew capsule during separation. The issues were so severe that NASA officials said the spacecraft could have been lost because of either of them, threatening the lives of astronauts, had any been on board. The flight never reached the space station, and after it returned to Earth, Boeing said it would attempt a second flight test after reviewing 1 million lines of code in the spacecraft.\n\nThe second attempt to fly the capsule without anyone onboard came about a year and a half later, during the summer of 2021. By then, Boeing said it had fixed the software issues. But this time several of the valves in the spacecraft's service module were corroded shut, and Boeing was unable to fix them while the craft was mounted on top of the rocket at the launchpad.\n\nTaking it down led to another delay.\n\nBoeing finally completed the uncrewed test flight in May 2022. But a little over a year later, as it was gearing up to fly astronauts, it announced the problem with the parachute system and the flammable tape.\n\nPart of the purpose of the crewed test flight is to see how the vehicle reacts in the vacuum of space, and NASA officials said they anticipate that the astronauts and ground controllers will have to react to unexpected issues. That, they said, is how they make the vehicle safer and more reliable.\n\n\"Let me just remind everybody again: This is a new spacecraft. I'll also remind you this is a test flight,\" Free said. \"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, things we expect to learn. This being a test mission, we may encounter things we don't expect. But our job now is to remain vigilant and keep looking for issues.\"\n\nWilliams, who was assigned years ago to the commercial crew program and has been waiting to fly since then, said she's convinced the teams are ready.\n\n\"We do anticipate everything's going to go as planned,\" she said in an interview. \"But if it doesn't, we'll take a moment and analyze it and talk about it, and we'll be okay. So our confidence in the mission is high.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal insulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality control"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/HQqJ5GqfOseChij4qXOUIOA-BNA=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/05/05/6637fc6236813.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 5930, "textEnd": 5943}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Scheduled for May 6, the mission will see the launch of Boeing's first Starliner carrying astronauts, with a test flight to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.\n\nThe crew, consisting of NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, will embark on a week-long test flight known as the Crew Flight Test (CFT). This mission serves as a crucial shakedown cruise for Boeing, aiming to validate the spacecraft's capabilities for future crewed missions.\n\nSpace enthusiasts eager to witness the historic launch can tune in to live coverage and updates provided by Boeing. The launch is scheduled for 10:34 p.m. EDT on Monday, with preparations underway at Space Launch Complex 41, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe significance of this mission lies in Boeing's selection as one of NASA's trusted partners for ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS. Alongside SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, Boeing's Starliner aims to bolster the agency's capacity for crewed space missions.\n\nHowever, the road to this milestone has been fraught with challenges. Previous attempts, including an unsuccessful test flight in December 2019, underscored the complexities involved in space travel. Nevertheless, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson expressed confidence in Boeing's readiness for this pivotal mission during a recent press conference.\n\nWith favorable weather conditions forecasted, Boeing has multiple launch opportunities lined up. In the event of unforeseen delays, backup launch dates on May 7, May 10, and May 11 offer additional windows for the mission's success.\n\nAs anticipation builds for the Starliner's journey to the ISS, all eyes are on Boeing as it prepares to usher in a new era of space exploration.", "source": {"uri": "arabtimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARAB TIMES - KUWAIT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/boeing-starliner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 15}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 192, "textEnd": 197}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1733, "textEnd": 1738}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 1740, "textEnd": 1746}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1752, "textEnd": 1758}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 1360, "textEnd": 1373}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The rocket will blast off to the International Space Station (ISS) for its first crewed mission this evening.\n\nStarliner will lift off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 10:34 p.m. EDT on Monday. Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who are both Navy-trained space program veterans, have been to ISS twice. They traveled on a shuttle and aboard a Russian Soyuz.\n\nWilliams said their return to the ISS was \"like going back home.\" Wilmore, on the other hand, said everything in the Boeing spacecraft is new and unique.\n\n\"I don't think either one of us ever dreamed that we'd be associated with the first flight of a brand new spacecraft,\" Wilmore said.\n\nDana Weigel, head of the agency's International Space Station program, said having a backup plan for human space flight aside from SpaceX's Dragon ships was \"really important.\" According to Weigel, with this flexibility, NASA would be better able to handle emergency scenarios with a specific spacecraft.\n\nStarliner will dock with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday at approximately 0500 GMT and stay for slightly more than a week. After testing to ensure everything operates as it should, Williams and Wilmore will board the capsule again to head back home.\n\nA successful mission would go a long way toward healing the sour taste left by the Starliner program's multiple disappointments.\n\nThe capsule was not put on the proper trajectory during the first unmanned test launch in 2019 and returned without reaching the ISS. Then, when the rocket was ready to take off again in 2021, clogged valves necessitated yet another delay. In May 2022, the empty ship eventually reached the International Space Station.\n\nTo get the capsule approved for NASA to use on routine ISS flights, Boeing has been working on the crewed test flight ever since. Though issues continued to arise, particularly with the parachute system that slows the ship down when it descends to Earth's atmosphere, it had intended to complete that journey in 2022.\n\nMark Nappi, an executive at Boeing, stated that there were some unexpected obstacles that needed to be resolved during the process that led to the delay. He added, however, that it undoubtedly strengthened the team, and they should be proud of themselves for being able to solve every problem they have faced. Typically, a human spaceflight spacecraft takes roughly 10 years from design to first flight.\n\nJim Free, an assistant administrator at NASA, cautioned that there may be bumps in the journey. According to him, there are undoubtedly some unknowns in this trip that they hope to learn, given that it's a test mission.

If the mission is successful, Boeing will become the second private firm to be able to provide NASA crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nThe stakes are high, especially for Boeing. The image of its airline business has been tarnished by a recent series of safety and regulation issues. The company's space sector is also under pressure as the launch of Starliner's crewed test flight has been delayed for several years due to technical setbacks.\n\nHere is a look at the mission, why its launch was delayed, and the significance of the mission.\n\nBut first, what is Boeing's Starliner?\n\nStarliner is a partially reusable crew capsule, officially known as CST-100 (crew space transportation). The capsule, which is 5 m tall and 4.6 m wide, consists of two modules. One is the crew module, which can accommodate seven astronauts -- although, for trips to the ISS, it will be modified for four astronauts and cargo. The crew module can be reused up to 10 times, with a six-month turnaround.\n\nThe other is the service module -- the powerhouse of the spacecraft -- which supplies electricity, propulsion, thermal control, air, and water in space. This module is expandable.\n\nWhat is the mission?\n\nThe main objective of the mission is to see how Starliner flares in space with a crew onboard. It is supposed to dock with the ISS -- a day after the launch -- for around 10 days before it returns to the Earth.\n\nBut before Starliner automatically docks with the space station, the crew members, who are NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, will test flying it manually. The crew will also \"test seats, assess onboard life-support and navigation systems, as well as evaluating the system that moves cargo into the ISS,\" according to a report by the BBC. The space suits worn by Wilmore and Williams will also be tested -- these blue suits are around 40% lighter than their predecessors and have touchscreen-sensitive gloves.\n\nDuring the return journey, NASA and Boeing will be keeping an eye on the spacecraft's heat shield and parachutes. They will slow the descent before airbags open to soften the moment of impact with the ground -- unlike other crew capsules, Starliner will land on the ground and not in the sea, the BBC report added.\n\nWhat caused the delay?\n\nAfter NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, it invited commercial space companies to help it transport astronauts and cargo to the ISS. Two companies got the contracts: SpaceX and Boeing. While SpaceX has been ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS since 2020, Boeing is yet to successfully launch its first crewed flight, something which may change on Tuesday.\n\nStarliner's first uncrewed flight itself came after four years of delay. Although it was set to take off in 2015, the company postponed it to 2019. When it did finally happen, a series of software and hardware failures thwarted the spacecraft from getting into its planned orbit and docking with the ISS, according to a report published by The Conversation.\n\nIt took more than 80 fixes for Starliner to make its first successful uncrewed flight. Even after achieving the goal, there were concerns about the performance of some thrusters and the spacecraft's cooling system. Additional problems were found subsequently -- there were issues with the safety of wiring and parachutes. As a result, Boring delayed the launch of Starliner's first crewed flight from 2023 to where we are today.\n\nWhy is the mission significant?\n\nThe mission's success is crucial for both NASA and Boeing. Currently, NASA has only one private company, SpaceX, which can take its astronauts and cargo to the ISS. Starliner getting approval for conducting routine flights to and from the ISS would give NASA a backup and option to not depend on one company or vehicle for space launches.\n\nThe success, however, is more important for Boeing. \"It's a really big day for Boeing\", Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the UK-based Open University, told the BBC.\n\n\"The company has been working on the spacecraft for so long, they have had a few problems with the test flights and there's a lot riding on this\".\n\nIf Starliner completes its objectives, it will also help Boeing challenge SpaceX's dominance in the commercial space industry.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alind_chauhan@indianexpress.com", "name": "Alind Chauhan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_thermal_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft thermal control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space suit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Starliner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Credit: NASA\n\nTwo astronauts are getting ready to fly a new spaceship built by Boeing, making this only the sixth time in history that NASA has flown a new passenger-grade spacecraft.\n\nThe pair, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, are seasoned Navy test pilots who have each spent six months in space. They are expected to launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, sending the new Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station.\n\nBarring any bad weather or other last-minute hiccups, the test flight could lift off as early as 10:34 p.m. ET on May 6.\n\n\"When we lay back on our backs on Monday evening, it's going to be real stuff, and the countdown is gonna be real, and it's gonna be a really thrilling time,\" said Wilmore, the crew commander.\n\nHere's how to watch this historic event.\n\nBeginning two days before the planned liftoff time, NASA will host a live video feed of the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. The official pre-launch broadcast will begin at about 6:30 p.m. ET on May 6, about four hours prior to launch.\n\nBoeing's Starliner has faced years of delays after NASA hired the company in 2014 to build a spaceship, along with SpaceX. The spacecraft has flown two times previously without any astronauts inside. During the first uncrewed test in 2019, the ship got on the wrong orbit due to software problems and didn't make it to the space station. The company did a redo of the test in 2022, which NASA largely viewed as successful.\n\nBut getting to its first flight with humans on board has been a struggle.

The Starliner is mounted on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket, ready for launch from Space Launch Complex 41. The liftoff will mark the 100th mission for ULA's workhorse rocket and the rocket's first mission supporting human spaceflight.\n\nThe final Starliner test comes after more than 10 years of testing and development. In 2014, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to fly astronauts to the ISS with commercial spacecraft. A crewless Starliner launched to the ISS two years ago and returned to Earth during an orbital flight test (OFT).\n\nNO 'JITTERS' FOR NASA ASTRONAUTS PREPARING TO LAUNCH ON BOEING STARLINER SPACECRAFT\n\nStarliner was set to launch Williams and Wilmore last summer, but Boeing managers revealed new issues with the spacecraft after further examining data from Starliner's OFT orbital flight test in May 2022. Boeing launched an orbital test flight without astronauts twice because of a botched first attempt in 2019 that failed to reach the ISS.\n\nBoth astronauts are retired Navy captains going to space for the third time. As the CFT crew, the astronauts will test out Starliner's capability to certify the spacecraft for future astronaut missions. As former Navy test pilots, both astronauts say it is an honor.\n\n\"I sort of have to pinch myself a little bit to understand we're actually going,\" Williams told reporters this week.\n\nNASA will begin live launch coverage at 6:30 p.m. ET on NASA.gov and NASA TV.\n\nSpectators will appreciate the night launch as the forecast this week is balmy and warm during the day. During the end of the countdown, the temperature will be about 72 degrees with 82% humidity. Pack your bug spray if you're camping out for the liftoff on Florida's Space Coast.\n\nThe most important forecast comes from the Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron. A day before liftoff, conditions look suitable for the astronauts' ride to space.\n\nLaunch weather officers forecast a 95% chance of favorable conditions for the 10:34 p.m. liftoff. The primary concern will be a slight chance of cumulus clouds in the area, posing a flight-through concern, but forecasters say the risk is low.\n\nHOW BOEING'S STARLINER SPACECRAFT, CREW WILL AVOID POTENTIALLY DEADLY 'BLACK ZONES' DURING TRIP TO ISS\n\nThe veteran astronauts will spend about a week on the International Space Station testing Starliner's systems before returning to Earth.\n\nA successful CFT will culminate in a soft landing of the Starliner spacecraft in the Southwest desert.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emilee_speck@foxweather.com", "name": "Emilee Speck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45th_Weather_Squadron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "45th Weather Squadron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA TV"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images.foxweather.com/static.foxweather.com/www.foxweather.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/53699303959_68e4d5b3f9_c.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The crew capsule will ride atop United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket, carrying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station and back.\n\nNASA will broadcast the launch live on its website and the space agency's YouTube channel, and you can also tune in through the feed below. The launch coverage will begin at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nBoeing's Crewed Flight Test is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, and is meant to transport crew and cargo to and from the ISS under a $4.3 billion contract with the space agency. NASA's other commercial partner, SpaceX, just launched its eighth crew to the space station.\n\nIt's been a rough journey for Boeing to make it to this point. Starliner's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 managed to reach space, but a software automation glitch caused the spacecraft to burn excess fuel, preventing it from making it to the ISS. Starliner miscalculated its location in space due to a glitch caused by a faulty mission elapsed timer.\n\nThe botched first flight prompted NASA to call for a second test flight of the empty spacecraft before a crew rides on board. In May 2022, Boeing completed the Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2), the second uncrewed test flight of Starliner, setting the stage for a crewed test flight. But OFT-2 suffered a few hiccups, including the failure of a thruster used for orbital maneuvering.\n\nBoeing's crewed Starliner launch was initially set for February 2023, then postponed to late April, and finally rescheduled for July 21, 2023. A few weeks before liftoff, however, the company announced that it was standing down from the launch attempt to address newfound issues with the crew vehicle.\n\nThe program has suffered from a slew of problems and delays from the start, which makes Monday's launch an absolute nail-biter.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Orbital Flight Test 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital maneuver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/b473fbbca62d8832910597bc138e3670.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

It's set to lift off from Canaveral's Space Launch Complex 41 at 10:34 p.m. to the International Space Station.\n\nThe duo will return after eight days with a landing in the Western United States. The pair will test docking, undocking and landing procedures, including manual takeovers for what would normally be automated systems.\n\n\"The success of this mission has always been very important for us as a program for a lot of reasons,\" said Mark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program manager, during a launch readiness review last month. \"Number one, we have humans flying on this vehicle. We always take that so seriously -- human spaceflight. ... Second is, this is an important capability for NASA, and so you know we signed up to go do this, and we're going to go do it and be successful at it.\"\n\nULA rolled the Atlas V to the pad Saturday morning from the Vertical Integration Facility amid clear blue skies with a forecast for Monday that expects a 95% chance for good weather. The first Atlas launch flew John Glenn to space in 1962, and this will mark the 100th Atlas rocket launch.\n\nIt's also the first time since Apollo 7 in 1968 that humans will launch from the Canaveral launch pads, with subsequent Apollo, space shuttle and SpaceX Crew Dragon flights all having come from neighboring Kennedy Space Center's two launch pads.\n\nBut Boeing's road to human spaceflight has been tortuous since NASA awarded the company, alongside SpaceX, the Commercial Crew Program contracts in 2014 to provide U.S.-based launches for its astronauts to the International Space Station. The goal was to stop reliance on Russia's Soyuz flights, NASA's only option after the space shuttle program ended in 2011.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free. \"I don't want to get too far ahead, since we'll still need to fly a successful mission, but when we do, and when we certify Starliner, the United States will have two unique human space transportation (systems) that provide critical redundancy for the ISS access.\"\n\nBoeing was in some ways deemed the safer bet by NASA, under which it could earn up to $4.2 billion of the contract, compared with SpaceX's initial $2.6 billion. Each company was required to perform one successful uncrewed test flight to the space station followed by a crewed flight, after which the spacecraft could be certified for use on up to six missions each under the initial contract.\n\nBoth companies faced development hurdles that pushed their first crewed test flights to 2019, but that's when SpaceX surged forward, while Boeing lagged behind.\n\nBoeing's first attempt at the uncrewed flight was not able to rendezvous with the space station. Although it landed safely, NASA deemed it a \"high visibility close call\" that forced a major overhaul of the program, including hardware, software and management practices from both Boeing and NASA.\n\nThat forced Boeing to absorb the costs for a second try, which it wasn't able to complete for more than two-and-a-half years, finally launching in May 2022.\n\nPost-flight analysis led to the discovery of further hardware problems and more delays, pushing the crewed flight even farther out. So now it's running nearly four years behind the pace of SpaceX, which has since flown its fleet of Crew Dragon spacecraft 13 times, taking 50 humans to space.\n\nAdded costs in the past three years alone have topped $800 million, with $288 million reported losses for Boeing in both 2022 and 2023, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report.\n\nThose have mostly been related to the delay of what should have been its first three rotational missions, dubbed Starliner-1, Starliner-2 and Starliner-3, all still awaiting certification, and therefore not guaranteed.\n\nThrough March 31, Boeing listed an additional $229 million in costs for the year, with an additional $158 million of \"potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to fixed-price unauthorized future missions.\"\n\nOriginal cost projections had its first three rotational missions completed by 2024, but with delays, those may not be finished until after 2026, with Starliner-1 only possible if this flight goes well. NASA has it targeted for February 2025 but is also prepping SpaceX's Crew-10 to potentially fly then if Starliner faces more delays.\n\n\"Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods,\" Boeing's report reads.\n\nDuring a year that Boeing's reputation has taken a hit from its airline woes, a win for Starliner could set up a much-needed lift for the company.\n\n\"I don't think of it in terms of what's important for Boeing, as much as I think of it as in terms of what's important for this program,\" Nappi said. \"What's important is to follow through with the commitments that we made to our customers.\"\n\nWhile SpaceX has ventured beyond its NASA contract to allow for commercial use of its Crew Dragon, the future for Starliner is less clear. Boeing would still share its astronaut taxi duties to the space station with SpaceX, so it would only be flying once per year through 2030, when plans are to decommission the space station.\n\n\"We have made some decisions in the last several months on the launch vehicle and making sure that we have enough launch vehicles to get us through -- we're on contract for six flights,\" Nappi said. \"That carries us out to the end of the decade, and so we've got plenty of time to think about what's after that. And we will do that. But right now the focus is on (the crew flight test).\"\n\nFrom NASA's perspective, the delay was not optimum, but a safe vehicle for its astronauts remains the most important goal of this test flight.\n\n\"I work side by side with (Nappi) and the Boeing team every day, and so what I see from them is what I've seen for the 37 years that I've worked in human spaceflight,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager. \"It's really the dedication, the persistence, the perseverance to take it step-by-step, to get the vehicle ready to go fly.\"", "source": {"uri": "nwaonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_7", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/nwa_redesign/graphics/adgog.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 4208, "textEnd": 4216}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

It had originally been scheduled to happen in 2015.\n\nIt was finally successful in 2022, paving the way for this mission.\n\nA successful take off overnight could be a much-needed boost for beleaguered Boeing, which has been hit by a series of incidents linked to its aircraft including a mid-air blow out on an Alaska Airlines plane in January.\n\nAt a pre-flight briefing with Nasa officials on Friday, Boeing vice president Mark Nappi said the company and the space agency were \"in total agreement\" that the Starliner was ready to fly with crew, adding, \"we can't be more confident.\"\n\nIf Starliner does not launch on the 6 May, there will be further opportunities on 7,10 and 11 May.\n\nIt should be visible in the night sky crossing the south west of the UK about 20 minutes after lift-off.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the mission?\n\nThe capsule has been designed to carry up to seven crew members and is intended to be reusable, making up to 10 flights.\n\nDuring the journey the crew will test seats, onboard life-support systems, navigation equipment and the system which moves cargo into the ISS.\n\nIf successful, astronauts Wilmore and Williams will remain at the ISS for about a week before taking the Starliner back to Earth.\n\nThey are expected to make a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US Desert Southwest - a first for crewed Nasa missions.\n\nThe success of this flight is key to the Starliner getting final approval to begin routine operational flights under Nasa's commercial crew program.\n\nIt will provide the space agency with a second way to send astronauts to low-Earth orbit from US soil since Elon Musk's SpaceX Crew Dragon began doing so in 2020.\n\nIn 2014, Nasa signed contracts with both Boeing and SpaceX to provide astronaut transport to the ISS as part of its Commercial Crew programme.\n\nStarliner is booked to fly at least six more crewed missions to the space station for Nasa, as long as this one goes according to plan.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sally_guyoncourt@inews.co.uk", "name": "Sally Guyoncourt", "type": "author",

If everything proceeds as intended, at 08.04 am on Tuesday ,two experienced astronauts, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, will embark on a mission that will serve as a crucial examination for Boeing's space division and NASA after several years.\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on its mission to the International Space Station.\n\nThe objective of the flight is to assess the spacecraft's performance in space while carrying a crew. If everything proceeds smoothly, the spacecraft will rendezvous with the swiftly moving space station, which travels at a speed of 17,500 mph (28,160 kmph), approximately one day after launch.\n\nDuring the mission, the crew members will have the opportunity to manually pilot the spacecraft before it autonomously docks with the space station. NASA and Boeing will closely observe the performance of the spacecraft's heat shield and parachutes as it safely returns astronauts Williams and Wilmore to Earth after approximately eight days.\n\nIn the event of a successful mission, Boeing will join SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, as the second private company capable of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nSunita Williams: Spiritual Astronaut\n\nSunita Williams, 58 years old, an astronaut of Indian origin, is preparing for her third space journey on Tuesday. In her previous missions, she brought the Bhagavad Gita with her into space.\n\nHowever, for her upcoming flight as the pilot on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, she will carry a Lord Ganesha idol, which she considers her \"lucky charm.\" Williams, in an interview with NDTV, mentioned that she identifies more as spiritual rather than religious.\n\nSunita Williams expressed her intention to bring a statue of Lord Ganesh during her upcoming commercial crew flight, explaining that Lord Ganesh is her personal symbol of good luck. She happily shared her excitement about having Lord Ganesh accompany her on her journey into outer space.\n\nAs per the report, while she may feel a bit anxious, Sunita Williams does not have any apprehensions about flying in a new spacecraft.

On 6 May, it will launch atop an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida. If the launch goes to plan, Starliner and its two passengers will arrive at the International Space Station (ISS) on 8 May.\n\nStarliner has been in the works for more than a decade, but its first test flight didn't take place until 2019. That flight reached orbit, but software issues prevented it from meeting up with the ISS. A second uncrewed test flight in 2022 was successful, setting the stage for the first crewed test.\n\nThe two test astronauts aboard Starliner are Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, each of whom has already been to the ISS twice before. The plan is for them to stay aboard the ISS for a week before returning to Earth.\n\nThe goal of this mission is to prove that Starliner is a safe option for transporting crew to and from the ISS, so most of its objectives involve testing out the spacecraft and its software. This is also the first time the Atlas V rocket has been used for a crewed mission. If all goes well, Starliner will be authorised for operation and begin making annual crewed flights.\n\nNASA awarded Boeing the contract to use Starliner as a shuttle to the ISS in 2014, at the same time as a similar contract was awarded to SpaceX for its Dragon capsule. Boeing has lagged behind Dragon, which made its first crewed flight in 2020 and is now on its eighth operational mission.\n\nWhen both are operational, it will give NASA a choice between rides to the ISS, which has not been the case since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011. \"This will give us that additional capability, because we always look for a backup,\" NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a 3 May press briefing. SpaceX has dominated crewed space flight in the US for years, so this may be the beginning of a broader playing field.", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leah_crane@newscientist.com", "name": "Leah Crane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_retirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle retirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06174045/SEI_202485702.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 73, "textEnd": 78}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 267, "textEnd": 272}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1747, "textEnd": 1752}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Sunita Williams is the pilot, while Butch Wilmore will be the commander.\n\nBoeing has developed the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner in collaboration with NASA for its Commercial Crew Programme, which involves ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS. The ISS is currently serviced by the SpaceX Dragon on the American side. The Starliner has been designed to accommodate up to seven passengers, or a mix of cargo and crew.\n\nFor NASA missions to the ISS, a maximum of four crew at a time will use the Starliner. The structure does not use any welds, and the Starliner can be used up to ten times with a turnaround time of about six months. The crew interfaces uses tablets, and the capsule also supports wireless internet. While the crew capsule itself is reusable, there is an expendable service module as well.\n\nWith a diameter of 4.56 metres, the Boeing Starliner is slightly larger than the Apollo command module, as well as the SpaceX Dragon, but smaller than the Orion capsule that will be used by the Artemis astronauts. The Starliner can remained docked to the ISS for up to seven months.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner was supposed to be operational in 2017 itself. NASA had selected the Starliner for further development at the same time as the SpaceX Dragon. The first uncrewed test mission was known as the Orbital Flight Test, and was conducted in 2019. The crew module did not reach the ISS as planned. The COVID-19 pandemic then introduced complications, affecting work schedules and supply chains.

(Image credit: Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nStarliner is at last at its Florida launch pad for its historic 1st mission with astronauts.\n\nAn Atlas V rocket rolled out to its launch pad on Saturday (May 4), also Star Wars Day, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station days before its historic first mission with astronauts. Atop the United Launch Alliance booster was Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which will also make its debut flight with humans onboard after launching no earlier than Monday (May 6).\n\nThe instantaneous launch window opens at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 GMT on Tuesday, May 7) and you can watch the historic International Space Station (ISS) mission live here at Space.com, courtesy of NASA Television.\n\nThe mission, called Crew Flight Test (CFT), will send two veteran NASA astronauts and former U.S. Navy test pilots aloft: Butch Wilmore will command the mission and Suni Williams will be the pilot. The duo are quarantining at the nearby Kennedy Space Center.\n\nI joined a group of about 35 reporters on a small hill about a mile away from Space Launch Complex 41 for my first-ever Floridian rocket rollout in which the booster was always going the right way towards the pad.\n\nBack in August 2006, I made an attempt to see mission STS-115 fly to the ISS. Then life happened. During my flight from Canada to the Space Coast, space shuttle Atlantis's launch pad was hit by lightning. As NASA took time to double-check all systems, Tropical Storm Ernesto made its way up the coast.\n\nSo instead of a launch, I witnessed Atlantis being pulled back towards shelter -- and then pause in its path to the Vehicle Assembly Building, and get pulled back to the launch pad when the tropical storm shifted far enough away to make that the safe choice. I definitely missed that launch, but no regrets, as that situation was a pretty unique one.\n\nStarliner's presence here two decades later is also unique, as the first spacecraft to bring astronauts to space from the Cape Canaveral side since Apollo 7 on Oct. 11, 1968.\n\nAnd no human has ridden any Atlas rocket since Gordon Cooper's Mercury-Atlas 9 mission on May 15, 1963 (almost exactly 61 years before Starliner's CFT launch attempt.)\n\nIf CFT goes to plan, Boeing will soon join SpaceX in sending astronauts for six months at a time to the ISS. That's after both companies received commercial crew contracts from NASA in 2014, valuing Boeing's at $4.2 billion back then, compared to SpaceX's $2.6 billion.\n\nWhile SpaceX has sent 12 crewed missions to ISS since 2020, including an astronaut test flight, Starliner's waited four extra years. Boeing's first ISS flight in December 2019 was dogged with so many computer glitches that Starliner never made it to its assigned orbit. After the COVID-19 pandemic erupted, and dozens of fixes were implemented, and Starliner at last made a successful second uncrewed test flight in May 2022.\n\nCFT was also expected to launch earlier, most recently 2023. Critical issues found last year delayed that, however, as Boeing officials sought to address issues with the loads on the capsule's main parachutes, as well as wiring covered in flammable tape.\n\nNASA and Boeing have carefully gone over all details ahead of this flight and maintained at a press conference Friday (May 3) that all is ready to go safety-wise. Weather is also 95% go for Monday's launch attempt on the Space Coast; that said, checks for proper technical fit and good weather will continue up to the moment of liftoff.\n\nThe spacecraft's first operational mission will be Starliner-1, no earlier than 2025, and it will send at least three astronauts to the ISS: NASA's Mike Fincke (who is also serving as a CFT backup astronaut), alongside NASA's Scott Tingle and the Canadian Space Agency's Joshua Kutryk (the capcom for CFT's ascent phase.)\n\nNASA plans to alternate SpaceX's Dragon and Boeing's Starliner in sending up astronauts at least every six months from U.S. soil. Russia's Soyuz spacecraft will also continue to send some agency astronauts aloft, for technical and policy reasons.\n\nWhile NASA aims to have these commercial crew vehicles working past the lifetime of ISS, the orbiting complex is expected to finish operations in 2030. Russia may pull out as soon as 2028, although all timelines are subject to flux as the countries work on implementing next-generation space programs.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]", "source": {"uri": "brudirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BruneiDirect"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-115", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "STS-115"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Atlas_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercury-Atlas 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Atlantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle Atlantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kutryk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Kutryk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_D._Tingle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott D.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nAfter spending years in its development, Boeing and NASA are ready to fly their Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS). Starliner is slated to take off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida tomorrow night. The mission will officially mark the start of Boeing's crewed astronaut missions. The flight will take NASA Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams to the ISS after the United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Atlas V rocket lifts off. Tomorrow's launch is a test flight for Starliner, which is the sixth crewed space exploration spacecraft flown by or for NASA in its history.\n\nThe Starliner's mission comes as Boeing's preferred launch provider, ULA, upgrades its vehicle portfolio to newer engines with the Vulcan rocket. If the Starliner CFT-1 mission is successful, then NASA and Boeing plan to fly the first operational Starliner mission to the ISS next year.\n\nWhile the Starliner launch is historic for NASA and Boeing, it also marks the first time that the ULA will fly humans to space this millennium. This process involves human rating the Atlas V, since Starliner is designed to fly primarily with ULA's rockets instead of SpaceX's Falcon 9. Starliner's successful docking with the ISS will also grow the portfolio of vehicles that NASA has to work with as it operates the orbiting space laboratory.\n\nAhead of tomorrow's launch, NASA spent a busy couple of weeks rearranging the ships docked at the station. One of these, the SpaceX Cargo Dragon, returned to Earth last month, after which the SpaceX's second Dragon shifted docking ports.\n\nAlong with evaluating Starliner's performance during liftoff, landing, and in space, the ship's crew will also participate in important in-space experiments on the station. These include evaluating the stress of extravehicular activity, or egress from the ISS into space, and the stress of launch and landing portions of the journey on the body.\n\nApart from the science experiments, Starliner's crew will also evaluate what it's like to live and work in space inside Starliner. NASA's aim with its crewed flights operated by the private sector has always been to have two ships available in case of an in-space emergency. SpaceX's Crew Dragon provided a nice backup to astronauts when the Russian Soyuz developed leaks while in space, and during CFT-1, the crew will perform a \"habitability evaluation\" to give NASA a \"feel\" of two additional crew inside Starliner according to NASA's Steve Stich during the Starliner CFT's pre-launch news conference on Friday.\n\nA key change on the Atlas V as part of its human rating is a new system on the Centaur upper stage. This is an emergency detection system that monitors the rocket's systems to provide crucial data to the astronauts in case of an anomaly that requires an in-flight emergency abort. Like SpaceX, ULA will also monitor the rocket through an ascent team which will share data with Boeing and NASA.\n\nAs for Boeing, it conducted last minute operations on Starliner yesterday after the ship and its rocket were transported to the launch pad. Final pre-launch operations preparations for Starliner include configuring the cargo so that the crew can enter and populate the ship and evaluating Starliner's power and other systems for habitability. Launch operations will continue until Monday night, with teams ready to meet today as well.\n\nBoeing will decide on what upgrades need to be made on the spacecraft after it evaluates Starliner's CFT performance; with one upgrade piquing NASA's interest involving the ship's landing system. Unlike SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which is designed to land in water to absorb the impact, Starliner lands on land and deploys a parachute system. According to NASA's Steve Stich, his agency is interested in upgrading this system's structure and ensuring that the ship can dock at multiple ports on the ISS.\n\nStarliner is slated to lift off at 10:34 p.m. Eastern time tomorrow, with a backup launch available the day after and on the 10th and 11th. Its crew will spend around a week in space before landing in the Southwestern region of the U.S. An earlier orbital test flight in 2019 saw the ship land in White Sands, New Mexico.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramish_zafar@wccftech.com", "name": "Ramish Zafar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_Centaur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulcan Centaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Docking and berthing of spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BOEING-STARLINER-LANDING-NEW-MEXICO-2019.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

That's the past. That is not now.\"\n\nCo-pilot Sunita Williams agreed, adding \"I feel like we've had a lot of lessons learned, and they've been incorporated. ... We wouldn't say we're ready if we weren't ready.\"\n\nThe Starliner's long-awaited liftoff atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station is targeted for 10:34 p.m. EDT Monday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries launch complex 41 into alignment with the space station's orbit.\n\nWilmore and Williams are well suited to take the Starliner for its first piloted test drive. Both are former Navy test pilots and two of NASA's most seasoned astronauts with four space flights, 11 spacewalks and 500 days in orbit between them. Both have flown to space aboard the space shuttle and Russia's Soyuz crew ferry ship.\n\nNow they are flying a new spacecraft on its first piloted flight.\n\n\"I remember getting selected for Test Pilot School and (wondering) if I'll ever be the first to do something in an airplane that's never been done,\" Wilmore, a former F/A-18 carrier pilot, Desert Storm veteran and pastor, told CBS News. \"Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined to be the crew for the first flight of a spacecraft. And here we are.\"\n\nAlong with chalking up the first piloted flight of the Starliner, it will be the first launch of astronauts using an Atlas rocket since Gordon Cooper's final Mercury flight more than 60 years ago.\n\nWhile hundreds of Atlas rockets have been launched since then, the latest-generation Atlas 5, equipped with a Russian-built RD-180 first-stage engine, is once again \"human rated,\" with high-reliability components and a state-of-the-art emergency fault detection system designed to trigger a safe escape in the event of an impending launch failure.\n\n\"We've both been to a couple of launches,\" Williams said. \"One of them was an Air Force payload. I found out the price tag on that payload, and I was like, OK, if they're launching that on that Atlas 5, I feel very comfortable sitting on (an) Atlas 5! It's a great rocket.\"\n\nIf the Atlas 5 runs into unexpected trouble, the Starliner, like SpaceX's Crew Dragon, features powerful abort motors capable of blasting the ship away from its booster at any point from the launch pad to orbit. The capsule then would descend to a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean off the East Coast of the United States.\n\nWhile fully automatic, Wilmore and Williams can manually trigger an abort if necessary. The spacecraft also features two independent systems giving the pilots computer-assisted and direct manual control if major guidance, navigation or computer problems crop up during launch or in orbit.\n\nThe Starliner flight marks only the sixth time NASA has put astronauts aboard a new spacecraft for the first time. Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, called the Starliner Crew Flight test, or CFT, \"an absolutely critical milestone.\"\n\n\"The lives of our crew members, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, are at stake,\" he said. \"Let me just remind everybody again, this is a new spacecraft. I'll also remind you this is a test flight. ... We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, we may encounter things we don't expect. But our job now is to remain vigilant and keep looking for issues.\"\n\nWhile he said he was confident the Starliner is ready to fly, Free said he did not want to \"get too far ahead\" since the crew has yet to complete a successful mission. But \"when we do,\" he added, \"and when we certify Starliner, the United States will have two unique human space transportations that provide critical redundancy for ISS access.\"\n\nAssuming a problem-free launch, it will take the Starliner about 15 minutes to reach its initial orbit. The flight plan calls for Wilmore and Williams to monitor a mostly automated rendezvous with the space station, taking time out twice to manually fly the spacecraft, verifying the crew's ability to fine-tune the trajectory or step in after a major malfunction.\n\nApproaching the station from behind and below, the astronauts will catch up with the lab complex early Wednesday, docking at the station's forward port at 12:46 a.m. on May 8.\n\nThey'll be welcomed aboard by Expedition 71 commander Oleg Kononenko and his Soyuz MS-25 crewmates, Nikolai Chub and NASA's Tracy Dyson, along with NASA Crew 8 commander Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps and cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin.\n\nWilmore and Williams plan to spend a little more than a week aboard the station, transferring 750 pounds of equipment to the lab, powering down the Starliner, and making sure it can be used as a \"safe haven\" for visiting long-duration crews. The current plan calls for undocking on May 15, but that could change depending on the weather at the landing site.\n\nUnlike SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which splashes down in the ocean at the end of a mission, the Starliner is designed to touch down on land, using parachutes and two sets of sequentially inflating airbags to ease the shock of touchdown. For the Crew Flight Test, a May 15 undocking would target landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico.\n\nBut given this is a test flight, NASA will not approve undocking unless winds at the landing site are 6 knots or less. The limit for the actual landing is 10 knots. As a result, NASA may replan for a night landing, when desert winds typically die down, at a different site.\n\nAssuming the flight goes well, NASA managers hope to certify the Starliner for operational crew ferry missions starting next year, launching one Crew Dragon and one Starliner each year to change out space station crew through the program's retirement at the end of the decade.\n\nCommercial crew program marks major shift in human spaceflight\n\nIn the wake of the space shuttle's retirement, NASA awarded two Commercial Crew Program contracts in 2014, one to SpaceX valued at $2.6 billion and the other to Boeing for $4.2 billion, to spur the development of independent spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station.\n\nThe goal was to end NASA's post-shuttle reliance on Russia's Soyuz and to resume launching American astronauts from U.S. soil aboard American rockets and spacecraft. Equally important to NASA: having two independent spacecraft for crew flights to the ISS in case one company's ferry ship runs into problems that might ground it for an extended period.\n\nThe original target date for initial piloted CCP flights was 2017. Funding shortfalls in Congress and technical snags delayed development, including an explosion during a ground test that destroyed a SpaceX Crew Dragon.\n\nBut the California rocket builder still managed to kick off piloted flights in May 2020, successfully launching two NASA astronauts on a Crew Dragon test flight to the space station.\n\nSince then, SpaceX has launched eight operational crew rotation flights to the station, three research missions to the lab funded by Houston-based Axiom Space and a purely commercial, two-man, two-woman trip to low-Earth orbit paid for by billionaire pilot and businessman Jared Isaacman. In all, 50 people have flown to orbit aboard Crew Dragons.\n\nIt's been a different story for Boeing's Starliner.\n\nDuring an initial unpiloted test flight in December 2019, unexpected software and communications glitches prevented a planned rendezvous with the space station. Boeing corrected those problems and opted to carry out a second uncrewed test flight, at its own expense.\n\nBut during the second countdown, engineers ran into problems with stuck propulsion system valves in the Starliner's service module. Engineers eventually traced the problem to moisture intrusion and corrosion, triggering another lengthy delay.\n\nThe second Starliner test flight in May 2022 was a success, docking at the space station as planned and returning to Earth with a pinpoint landing. But in the wake of the flight, engineers discovered fresh problems: trouble with parachute harness connectors and concern about protective tape wrapped around wiring that could catch fire in a short circuit.\n\nWork to correct those issues pushed the first crewed flight to this year. When all was said and done, Boeing spent more than $1 billion of its own money to pay for the additional test flight and corrective actions.\n\nA critical mission for Boeing\n\nThe CFT launching comes at a critical time for Boeing given the aftermath of two highly publicized 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 and more recently, the blowout of a cabin door \"plug\" during an Alaska Airlines flight that has raised fresh questions about the company's safety culture.\n\nFor his part, Wilmore said he didn't view the Starliner launch in the context of Boeing's trouble with its airplanes.\n\n\"I don't think it has necessarily anything to do with Boeing and a flight going off,\" he said. \"They're all vitally important. This is human spaceflight. That adage you've heard since Apollo 13, failure is not an option? That has nothing specifically to do with Boeing or this program. That's all the things that we do in human spaceflight.\n\n\"So, this one is no more or less important than anything else we're doing,\" he said. \"It just happens to be the most important one we're doing right now.\"\n\nWilliams acknowledged the Starliner's rocky road to launch. \"I'm not going to say it's been easy. It's a little bit of (an) emotional roller coaster.\"\n\nBut, she added, \"We knew we would get here eventually. It's a solid spacecraft. I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now.\"\n\nLongtime Trump aide Hope Hicks takes the stand in New York trial\n\nLouisiana boy receives surprising reward after generously

Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, called the Starliner Crew Flight test, or CFT, \"an absolutely critical milestone.\"\n\n\"The lives of our crew members, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, are at stake,\" he said. \"Let me just remind everybody again, this is a new spacecraft. I'll also remind you this is a test flight. ... We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, we may encounter things we don't expect. But our job now is to remain vigilant and keep looking for issues.\"\n\nWhile he said he was confident the Starliner is ready to fly, Free said he did not want to \"get too far ahead\" since the crew has yet to complete a successful mission. But \"when we do,\" he added, \"and when we certify Starliner, the United States will have two unique human space transportations that provide critical redundancy for ISS access.\"\n\nAssuming a problem-free launch, it will take the Starliner about 15 minutes to reach its initial orbit. The flight plan calls for Wilmore and Williams to monitor a mostly automated rendezvous with the space station, taking time out twice to manually fly the spacecraft, verifying the crew's ability to fine-tune the trajectory or step in after a major malfunction.\n\nApproaching the station from behind and below, the astronauts will catch up with the lab complex early Wednesday, docking at the station's forward port at 12:46 a.m. on May 8.\n\nThey'll be welcomed aboard by Expedition 71 commander Oleg Kononenko and his Soyuz MS-25 crewmates, Nikolai Chub and NASA's Tracy Dyson, along with NASA Crew 8 commander Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps and cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin.\n\nWilmore and Williams plan to spend a little more than a week aboard the station, transferring 750 pounds of equipment to the lab, powering down the Starliner, and making sure it can be used as a \"safe haven\" for visiting long-duration crews. The current plan calls for undocking on May 15, but that could change depending on the weather at the landing site.\n\nUnlike SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which splashes down in the ocean at the end of a mission, the Starliner is designed to touch down on land, using parachutes and two sets of sequentially inflating airbags to ease the shock of touchdown. For the Crew Flight Test, a May 15 undocking would target landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico.\n\nBut given this is a test flight, NASA will not approve undocking unless winds at the landing site are 6 knots or less. The limit for the actual landing is 10 knots. As a result, NASA may replan for a night landing, when desert winds typically die down, at a different site.\n\nAssuming the flight goes well, NASA managers hope to certify the Starliner for operational crew ferry missions starting next year, launching one Crew Dragon and one Starliner each year to change out space station crew through the program's retirement at the end of the decade.\n\nIn the wake of the space shuttle's retirement, NASA awarded two Commercial Crew Program contracts in 2014, one to SpaceX valued at $2.6 billion and the other to Boeing for $4.2 billion, to spur the development of independent spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station.\n\nThe goal was to end NASA's post-shuttle reliance on Russia's Soyuz and to resume launching American astronauts from U.S. soil aboard American rockets and spacecraft. Equally important to NASA: having two independent spacecraft for crew flights to the ISS in case one company's ferry ship runs into problems that might ground it for an extended period.\n\nThe original target date for initial piloted CCP flights was 2017. Funding shortfalls in Congress and technical snags delayed development, including an explosion during a ground test that destroyed a SpaceX Crew Dragon.\n\nBut the California rocket builder still managed to kick off piloted flights in May 2020, successfully launching two NASA astronauts on a Crew Dragon test flight to the space station.\n\nSince then, SpaceX has launched eight operational crew rotation flights to the station, three research missions to the lab funded by Houston-based Axiom Space and a purely commercial, two-man, two-woman trip to low-Earth orbit paid for by billionaire pilot and businessman Jared Isaacman. In all, 50 people have flown to orbit aboard Crew Dragons.\n\nIt's been a different story for Boeing's Starliner.\n\nDuring an initial unpiloted test flight in December 2019, unexpected software and communications glitches prevented a planned rendezvous with the space station. Boeing corrected those problems and opted to carry out a second uncrewed test flight, at its own expense.\n\nBut during the second countdown, engineers ran into problems with stuck propulsion system valves in the Starliner's service module. Engineers eventually traced the problem to moisture intrusion and corrosion, triggering another lengthy delay.\n\nThe second Starliner test flight in May 2022 was a success, docking at the space station as planned and returning to Earth with a pinpoint landing. But in the wake of the flight, engineers discovered fresh problems: trouble with parachute harness connectors and concern about protective tape wrapped around wiring that could catch fire in a short circuit.\n\nWork to correct those issues pushed the first crewed flight to this year. When all was said and done, Boeing spent more than $1 billion of its own money to pay for the additional test flight and corrective actions.\n\nThe CFT launching comes at a critical time for Boeing given the aftermath of two highly publicized 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 and more recently, the blowout of a cabin door \"plug\" during an Alaska Airlines flight that has raised fresh questions about the company's safety culture.\n\nFor his part, Wilmore said he didn't view the Starliner launch in the context of Boeing's trouble with its airplanes.\n\n\"I don't think it has necessarily anything to do with Boeing and a flight going off,\" he said. \"They're all vitally important. This is human spaceflight. That adage you've heard since Apollo 13, failure is not an option? That has nothing specifically to do with Boeing or this program. That's all the things that we do in human spaceflight.\n\n\"So, this one is no more or less important than anything else we're doing,\" he said. \"It just happens to be the most important one we're doing right now.\"\n\nWilliams acknowledged the Starliner's rocky road to launch. \"I'm not going to say it's been easy. It's a little bit of (an) emotional roller coaster.\"\n\nBut, she added, \"We knew we would get here eventually. It's a solid spacecraft. I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Since 2020, SpaceX completed its crewed test flight and has ferried eight operations crews to the base -- while Boeing has managed only two unmanned flights, including one that docked remotely in May of last year.\n\nBoeing has long-standing and historic ties to the aerospace industry in Southern California -- the Apollo command and service modules were built at North American Aviation's plant in Downey. Its current operations include a satellite facility in El Segundo.\n\nBoeing's new Starliner capsule was scheduled to launch with a crew last summer, but a problem was discovered with its parachute system and the use of flammable tape in the craft, a mile of which was removed. It was just the most recent of several delays.\n\nStarliner, with crew members strapped in, is set to blast off at 10:34 p.m. Eastern time at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. If the weather doesn't cooperate or other minor issues arise, it could fly the next day or later in the week.\n\nAfter the delays and a reported $1.5 billion in cost overruns the company had to absorb, analysts say it's critical that the mission goes well. That's especially true, given Boeing's already battered reputation, after two crashes of its 737 Max 8 jets and a door plug that blew out of a 737 Max 9 flight this year on its way to Ontario International Airport in San Bernardino County.\n\n\"It's very important for [Boeing's] desire to be relevant to NASA, relevant to manned space flight and for confidence internally to turn around and execute a program that's had problems,\" said Ken Herbert, a Boeing analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"This could be a big win for Boeing, if they can successfully pull this off, just in light of all the bad news they get from every other part of the business.\"\n\nThe capsule is designed to be reused 10 times, similar to SpaceX's Dragon Capsule that services the station. It will be launched from an Atlas V rocket, a reliable workhorse built by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Starliner should take about 26 hours to reach the station, which orbits at roughly 17,500 mph.\n\nThe flight plan calls for NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams to spend a minimum of eight days testing the docked Starliner capsule, before returning to Earth as soon as May 15. Unlike SpaceX's capsule, which splashes down on water, Starliner will deploy giant air bags and touch down on land in one of four possible locations in the Southwest -- a system the Russian space program has used since its inception. Edwards Air Force Base in Kern County is a contingency landing zone.\n\nAssuming the flight is a success, Boeing would be cleared to fly Starliner on regular flights carrying cargo and astronauts, where it would stay docked for six months and provide NASA with a second, redundant American craft to reach the station, a longtime goal. The 15-feet-in-diameter capsule, shaped like a Hershey's Kiss, can carry up to seven astronauts without cargo or fewer with it.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson expressed confidence in the flight despite problems Boeing has experienced with its commercial aircraft.\n\n\"Understand that anytime you fly in space, it's risky business, but we don't fly, until we -- NASA -- are satisfied that it is as safe as possible,\" he told The Times.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson declined to respond to requests for comment.\n\nMark Nappi, the manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference Friday, \"I have never felt readier on any mission that I have ever participated in. ... We are where we are supposed to be at this point.\"\n\nNASA contracted with SpaceX and Boeing after being forced to rely solely on the Russian space program to resupply and send crews to the station after the space shuttle program ended in 2011.\n\nA longer-term issue for Boeing is that it has taken so long to certify Starliner that it might only service the station for its contracted six missions before the lab is sent back to Earth in 2031 in a controlled descent, where it will burn up in the atmosphere. Initially assembled in 1988, it is now the size of a football field and some pieces are expected to land in the far reaches of the ocean.\n\nNASA wants to focus its resources on planned missions to the moon and deep space through its Artemis program, and the Russians aren't interested either, said aerospace analyst Marco Caceres of Teal Group.\n\n\"The Russians have certainly expressed their desire not to continue their presence for no more than another 10 years,\" he said.\n\nWhile the station includes modules from multiple countries, NASA and the Russian program were its primary constructors, including a core power module the Russians sent up on the very first launch.\n\nThere have been nearly 4,000 scientific studies conducted on the station and commercial space stations are being to developed to conduct science as needed. That includes Orbital Reef, a planned station by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin aerospace company.\n\nNASA expects that Boeing and SpaceX will service those stations, and Boeing has said it has plans to launch Starliner to ferry astronauts to the station, which is still in its early development stages. Nappi said Friday that the company will \"have time to make those decisions.\"\n\nEven if the Starliner flight goes flawlessly, NASA will continue to send astronauts to the space station on Russia's Soyuz craft, given the country's key role in building and continuing to operate the station.\n\nNelson said that aside from Russia's operational role, it is important for the two space programs to maintain good relations despite tensions over the war in Ukraine, noting that each country has personnel embedded in the other's mission control operations. He recalled how that relationship began when an Apollo capsule docked with a Russian Soyuz craft in a historic test project started amid the Cold War.\n\n\"This cooperation in space has been going in genuine success ever since Gen. Tom Stafford and Gen. Alexei Leonov came across that threshold docked in space in 1975,\" he said. \"There has been no evidence we have any problem. It is steady as you go.\"\n\n2024 Los Angeles Times.

The astronauts then will monitor two quick thruster firings to fine-tune the ship's orbit before taking turns testing the spacecraft's computer-assisted manual control system.\n\nAs with any other space station rendezvous, the Starliner will approach the lab from behind and below, looping up to a point directly ahead of the outpost and then moving in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:46 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nDuring final approach, Wilmore and Williams will again test the capsule's manual controls, making sure future crews can tweak the trajectory or the spacecraft's orientation at their own discretion if needed.\n\nThe Starliner also is equipped with a fully manual backup system that allows the crew to directly command the ship's thrusters using a joystick-like hand controller, bypassing the spacecraft's flight computers. Wilmore and Williams will test that system after departing the station around May 15 to begin the trip back to Earth.\n\nIf the Starliner test flight goes well, NASA managers plan to certify it for routine crew rotation flights, launch one Crew Dragon and one Starliner each year to deliver long-duration crew members to the station for six-month tours of duty.\n\n\"An absolutely critical milestone\"\n\nJim Free, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, called the Starliner Crew Flight test, or CFT, \"an absolutely critical milestone.\"\n\n\"Let me just remind everybody again, this is a new spacecraft,\" he told reporters last week. \"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, we may encounter things we don't expect. But our job now is to remain vigilant and keep looking for issues.\"\n\nWhile he said he was confident the Starliner was up to the task, Free said he did not want to \"get too far ahead\" since the crew has yet to complete a successful mission. But \"when we do,\" he added, \"and when we certify Starliner, the United States will have two unique human space transportations that provide critical redundancy for the ISS access.\"\n\nBut it hasn't been easy.\n\nIn the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded two Commercial Crew Program contracts in 2014, one to SpaceX valued at $2.6 billion and the other to Boeing for $4.2 billion, to spur development of independent spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station.\n\nThe target date for initial piloted CCP flights was 2017. Funding shortfalls in Congress and technical snags delayed development, including an explosion during a ground test that destroyed a SpaceX Crew Dragon.\n\nBut the California rocket builder finally kicked off piloted flights in May 2020, successfully launching two NASA astronauts on a Crew Dragon test flight to the space station.\n\nSince then, SpaceX has launched eight operational crew rotation flights to the station, three research missions to the lab funded by Houston-based Axiom Space and a purely commercial, two-man, two-woman trip to low-Earth orbit paid for by billionaire pilot and businessman Jared Isaacman. In all, 50 people have flown to orbit aboard Crew Dragons.\n\nIt's been a different story for Boeing's Starliner.\n\nDuring an initial unpiloted test flight in December 2019, a software error prevented the ship's flight computer from loading the correct launch time from its counterpart aboard the Atlas 5.\n\nAs a result, a required orbit insertion burn did not happen on time and because of unrelated communications issues, flight controllers were unable to regain control in time to press ahead with a space station rendezvous.\n\nThe software problems were addressed after the Starliner's landing, along with a variety of other issues that came to light in a post-flight review. Boeing opted to carry out a second test flight, at its own expense, but the company ran into into stuck propulsion system valves in the Starliner's service module. Engineers were unable to resolve the problem and the capsule was taken off its Atlas 5 and hauled back to its processing facility for troubleshooting.\n\nEngineers eventually traced the problem to moisture, presumably from high humidity and torrential rain after rollout to the pad, that chemically reacted with thruster propellant to form corrosion. The corrosion prevented the valves from opening on command.\n\nTo clear the way for launch the following May, the valves in a new service module were replaced and the system was modified to prevent water intrusion on the launch pad. The second Starliner test flight in May 2022 was a success, docking at the space station as planned and returning to Earth with a pinpoint landing.\n\nBut in the wake of the flight, engineers discovered fresh problems: trouble with parachute harness connectors and concern about protective tape wrapped around wiring that could catch fire in a short circuit.\n\nWork to correct those issues pushed the first crewed flight from 2023 to 2024. When all was said and done, Boeing spent more than $1 billion of its own money to pay for the additional test flight and corrective actions.\n\nTeens surprise math world with Pythagorean Theorem

Let's launch ourselves into the details and understand the situation.\n\nBoeing's CST-100 Starliner has recently been under scrutiny due to technical issues, delaying its crewed missions. Despite setbacks, such as flammability concerns and other technical hiccups, Boeing remains steadfast in its partnership with NASA. The company's first crewed flight, known as the Crew Flight Test (CFT), is scheduled for May 6, 2024, and aims to transport NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to the International Space Station (ISS). This marks a significant milestone for Boeing and the aerospace community.\n\nThe Crew and Mission Details\n\nWilmore and Williams, both veteran astronauts with extensive experience on the ISS, will be the first to command Boeing's spacecraft and are keen to ensure a smooth launch-to-landing journey. Wilmore emphasized their readiness to evaluate Starliner from launch to touchdown. The spacecraft will make it descend on land instead of water, easing recovery logistics. Their mission includes tasks akin to a routine crew rotation to validate Starliner's operational reliability.\n\nThe Challenges Behind the Launch\n\nTechnical hurdles like flammability issues and schedule delays challenged Boeing's Starliner program. However, the recent removal of the problematic P-213 tape and other improvements helped clear several obstacles. NASA and Boeing are working meticulously to address the malfunctions and have undergone numerous checkpoints to ensure Starliner's readiness.\n\nNASA and Boeing's Vision\n\nThis mission reflects NASA's commitment to diverse crewed transportation options and their collaboration with the private sector. Boeing's participation expands NASA's capacity to safely transport astronauts, reinforcing the importance of redundancy and resilience in space missions.\n\nWith SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule already ferrying astronauts, healthy competition pushes Boeing to improve Starliner's performance. This can ultimately lead to a safer and more reliable spacecraft for future missions.\n\nAlthough technical glitches delayed Boeing's Starliner mission, the successful collaboration with NASA underscores the importance of public-private partnerships.

You can watch the action live here at Space.com, courtesy of NASA.\n\nThe liftoff will kick off Crew Flight Test (CFT), a roughly 10-day shakeout cruise to the International Space Station (ISS) that will be Starliner's first-ever astronaut mission. Such crewed debuts to Earth orbit have happened just five times in American history, as NASA chief Bill Nelson noted during a press briefing on Friday (May 3).\n\n\"So, you think of it: The first time [NASA astronauts] have flown on a new spacecraft started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, then space shuttle, then Dragon and now Starliner,\" Nelson said. \"So it is a historical day; it's a wonderful day.\"\n\nRelated: Facts about Starliner, Boeing's next-generation spaceship for astronauts\n\nDragon is the capsule built by SpaceX, which, like Boeing, won a contract from NASA's Commercial Crew Program back in 2014 to carry agency astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nThe goal was to get at least one American crewed vehicle up and running as soon as safely possible in the wake of the space shuttle's 2011 retirement, which left NASA completely dependent on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed transportation services to and from the ISS.\n\nSpaceX launched its version of CFT, called Demo-2, in May 2020. Elon Musk's company has since completed seven operational astronaut missions to the station, and it's in the middle of its eighth, which launched in March. As that record shows, SpaceX has proven to be a reliable and prolific partner for NASA. But the agency is still excited to get a second American astronaut taxi online, given how complex and demanding human spaceflight is.\n\n\"This will give us that additional capability, because we always look for a backup,\" Nelson said.\n\nIf all goes well with CFT, Starliner could launch its first contracted, six-month crewed mission to the ISS as soon as early 2025.\n\nCFT's launch will be historic in other ways as well. For example, it will be the first-ever astronaut liftoff for the venerable Atlas V, and the first crew-carrying mission for any member of the Atlas rocket family since May 15, 1963. On that day, an Atlas LV-3B launched Faith 7, the final mission of the Mercury program, which sent NASA astronaut Gordon Cooper into orbit for 34 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nNelson also noted another special aspect of tonight's liftoff: It will mark the first time since the May 1968 launch of Apollo 7 that a crewed mission leaves Earth from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (or, in its former incarnation, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station).\n\nMany astronaut missions have lifted off from Florida's Space Coast since then, including those flown by NASA's space shuttle and SpaceX's Dragon. But those flights all launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, which is next door to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crew Dragon Demo-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_LV-3B", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas LV-3B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Cooper"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTKqUwdtp2yQyTXXKMFdrB-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 173, "textEnd": 178}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 440, "textEnd": 445}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 847, "textEnd": 852}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 1699, "textEnd": 1707}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-05-", "textStart": 2540, "textEnd": 2546}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

And FLORIDA TODAY's Space Team, which consists of award-winning reporter Rick Neale, reporter Brooke Edwards and veteran visuals journalist Craig Bailey, has its own coverage plans complete with a live blog, tweets, video and photos from Cape Canaveral, near Kennedy Space Center and across Brevard County.\n\nWho's the Starliner crew? On board the rocket will be two NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, both Navy test pilots. They have each flown in space twice.\n\nDubbed NASA's Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test Launch for livestreams online, coverage starts at 6:30 p.m. EDT Monday. Keep scrolling for information on the long-anticipated Starliner rocket launch and how to watch our Space Team's coverage on various platforms, from your Android or iPhone to your big screen in your living room.\n\nWhat is Boeing's Starliner?\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft will transport NASA astronauts. The company calls it the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner, or simply \"Starliner.\" Set to launch no earlier than May 6, 2024, it will make history as the first spacecraft to ferry humans from Space Launch Complex 41 in Cape Canaveral. The launch pad has been the site for historic missions beginning with the Titan rockets in 1965 and including the New Horizons deep space probe, the Voyager spacecraft, and even the Curiosity Mars rover.\n\nStarliner will be launched with the help of a United Launch Alliance (a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin) Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V rocket has launched from the site since 2002, but this will be the first time it carries astronauts to space.\n\nWho are the NASA astronauts flying into space for Starliner launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida?\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying this commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are Navy test pilots. They have each flown in space twice and both bring a wide variety of experiences to the flight.\n\nWilliams was originally a helicopter test pilot before switching to flying jets. She's preparing to fly to space for the third time, as the crew test flight pilot.\n\nThis will be Wilmore's third spaceflight as well. Before becoming a NASA astronaut, Wilmore was a U.S. Navy captain, fighter pilot, and test pilot, accumulating more than 8,000 hours of flight time. Wilmore flew the FA-18 Hornet and T-45 Goshawk, playing a role in missions during Operation Desert Storm, Desert Shield and Southern Watch.\n\nMonday, May 6: NASA's Boeing Starliner crewed flight test\n\nHow to watch Starliner rocket launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, online\n\nTune in to floridatoday.com/space for USA TODAY Network's Space Team live coverage and updates on the Boeing Starliner rocket launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, starting at 6:30 p.m. EDT Monday.

International. Boeing reaches this point after a long history of delays and problems in the design and testing of the Starliner. And at a delicate moment for the company, after the serious accidents suffered by some of its planes in recent years.\n\nIn 2011, and after the last flight of a space shuttle, NASA launched the so-called Commercial Crew Program, a project with which private initiative was entrusted with the recovery of the North American capacity to send astronauts to space and stop depending on the Russian Soyuz. The program materialized in 2014 with the granting of contracts to SpaceX and Boeing to design the country's new spacecraft.\n\nBoeing frente a SpaceX\n\nSince then, the trajectory that the two corporations have followed has been very different. Although Boeing's design initially seemed more promising, SpaceX took the lead in 2019, when the Demo-1 mission of its Dragon 2 spacecraft, still without humans on board, managed to reach the International Space Station. A year later, on May 31, 2020, Elon Musk's company achieved historic success with the flight of two astronauts on Demo-2. Currently, SpaceX has already completed eight manned missions for NASA and another four for private clients.\n\nFor its part, Boeing expected its Starliner to be operational in 2015, but problems with the design caused a long chain of delays. When it seemed that the difficulties had been overcome, in December 2019 the Boeing ship suffered a failure on its maiden unmanned flight, which prevented it from reaching the space station. Then, another technical mishap, in August 2021, caused the cancellation of a new launch attempt. Finally, a Starliner managed to dock with the space station in May 2022, but Boeing later postponed, without date, the first crewed mission, initially scheduled for July 2023, due to problems with the parachutes that must slow the ship when returning to the earth.\n\nThe inaugural mission\n\nOn this morning's flight, the Starliner will be propelled by an Atlas V rocket from the ULA (United Launch Alliance) company, and will transport two astronauts (there will be four on subsequent missions). These are Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both on NASA staff. They are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Wednesday the 8th at 06:48 (peninsular time), and to remain there for a week.\n\nIf everything goes well, this mission should serve for NASA to approve the Starliner and the ship to finally enter operational mode. This would allow Boeing to opt for the six manned flights that the current contract with the space agency ensures until 2030, the year in which the International Space Station is scheduled to end its service. In the case of SpaceX, 14 more missions are expected under the auspices of NASA.\n\nA company with problems\n\nIn recent years, Boeing has suffered serious mishaps with some of its planes. In 2018 and 2019, two 737 Max crashed, causing 346 deaths and temporarily halting manufacturing of the aircraft. A new incident, in January of this year, caused the loss of a door in mid-flight and once again called into question the corporation's quality control measures.\n\nCurrently, Boeing is immersed in several investigations by regulatory authorities, especially after one of its engineers denounced the cuts in materials applied in the manufacture of the 777 and 787 Dreamliner models. This being the case, the space flight this morning could mean a boost of oxygen for Boeing's public image or, on the contrary, further deepen the crisis that the company is experiencing.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Aviation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North American Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crew Dragon Demo-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crew Dragon Demo-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_0e164.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-31", "textStart": 1258, "textEnd": 1270}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 1663, "textEnd": 1676}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The astronauts will spend just over a week testing the Starliner spacecraft which was built to hold up to seven passengers for missions conducted in low-Earth orbit - an altitude of 620 miles or less above the Earth's surface.\n\nThis comes as Boeing has undergone scrutiny over numerous aircraft failures and whistleblower complaints alleging the company cut corners when building its 747 Max planes. The launch will take off at 10:34 p.m. ET from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and live coverage of the liftoff will be on NASA's YouTube page and website.\n\nNASA intends to use the Starliner to eventually ferry four astronauts, cargo and scientific instruments to and from the International Space Station (ISS) if Monday's mission is a success. The astronauts boarding the Starliner are Barry 'Butch' Wilmore (right) and Sunita 'Suni' Williams (left), who are both former Navy test pilots and have each gone to space twice.\n\n'The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone,' NASA Associate Administrator James Free told reporters during a recent flight readiness review, Florida Today reported. 'The lives of our crew members, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all,' he added. Boeing's previous attempt at a crewed flight in July of last year was pushed to this year while they dealt with problems surrounding the parachute system used to bring the capsule back to Earth after the mission.\n\nNASA said the 'soft links' in the parachutes were weaker than they should be and didn't meet the safety requirements. The agency also removed a tape on the wiring harness called P-213 that is flammable in certain environments. Laura Forczyk, the executive director of the space consulting firm Astralytical, told NPR that the two-year delay between the craft's test launch and carrying astronauts 'means that NASA and Boeing are taking this very seriously, but it also makes me nervous because it has been two years since this vehicle has been operational.'\n\nIn 2019, the Starliner experienced another failure during an uncrewed liftoff to reach the ISS, but dozens of software and engineering problems caused the capsule to return to Earth once it reached orbit. 'We have very robust processes, and the certificate of readiness process that we use to review everything ... the design certification process, they are all very robust,' Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Starliner program, said during a NASA news conference in March.\n\n'And the proof of that is the fact that the problems we have caught in the past have been caught as part of that process,' he added. Yet, even as Boeing moves toward the Starliner launch , the scandals surrounding the disastrous consequences of mismanaged 737 Max aircrafts. The Federal Aviation Administration opened an audit into Boeing's production after a rear door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 plane shortly after takeoff earlier this year.\n\nAn investigation revealed the door was missing four bolt plugs that are supposed to hold the door in place and three whistleblowers have come forward to detail the lapse in the company's quality control during production. A Boeing 737 MAX 8 suffered a form of gear collapse as it landed in Houston, Texas in March, causing the plane to veer off the runway , then a wheel fell off a 777-200 aircraft shortly after takeoff from San Francisco and a 737's engine caught fire mid-way through a flight to Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nIn the wake of the accidents, Boeing reported it had lost $355 million in revenue in the first quarter of this year and its stocks tumbled 10 percent in one week after the Alaska Airlines incident.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The astronauts then will monitor two quick thruster firings to fine-tune the ship's orbit before taking turns testing the spacecraft's computer-assisted manual control system.\n\nAs with any other space station rendezvous, the Starliner will approach the lab from behind and below, looping up to a point directly ahead of the outpost and then moving in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:46 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nDuring final approach, Wilmore and Williams will again test the capsule's manual controls, making sure future crews can tweak the trajectory or the spacecraft's orientation at their own discretion if needed.\n\nThe Starliner also is equipped with a fully manual backup system that allows the crew to directly command the ship's thrusters using a joystick-like hand controller, bypassing the spacecraft's flight computers. Wilmore and Williams will test that system after departing the station around May 15 to begin the trip back to Earth.\n\nIf the Starliner test flight goes well, NASA managers plan to certify it for routine crew rotation flights, launch one Crew Dragon and one Starliner each year to deliver long-duration crew members to the station for six-month tours of duty.\n\nJim Free, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, called the Starliner Crew Flight test, or CFT, \"an absolutely critical milestone.\"\n\n\"Let me just remind everybody again, this is a new spacecraft,\" he told reporters last week. \"We certainly have some unknowns in this mission, we may encounter things we don't expect. But our job now is to remain vigilant and keep looking for issues.\"\n\nWhile he said he was confident the Starliner was up to the task, Free said he did not want to \"get too far ahead\" since the crew has yet to complete a successful mission. But \"when we do,\" he added, \"and when we certify Starliner, the United States will have two unique human space transportations that provide critical redundancy for the ISS access.\"\n\nBut it hasn't been easy.\n\nIn the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded two Commercial Crew Program contracts in 2014, one to SpaceX valued at $2.6 billion and the other to Boeing for $4.2 billion, to spur development of independent spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station.\n\nThe target date for initial piloted CCP flights was 2017. Funding shortfalls in Congress and technical snags delayed development, including an explosion during a ground test that destroyed a SpaceX Crew Dragon.\n\nBut the California rocket builder finally kicked off piloted flights in May 2020, successfully launching two NASA astronauts on a Crew Dragon test flight to the space station.\n\nSince then, SpaceX has launched eight operational crew rotation flights to the station, three research missions to the lab funded by Houston-based Axiom Space and a purely commercial, two-man, two-woman trip to low-Earth orbit paid for by billionaire pilot and businessman Jared Isaacman. In all, 50 people have flown to orbit aboard Crew Dragons.\n\nIt's been a different story for Boeing's Starliner.\n\nDuring an initial unpiloted test flight in December 2019, a software error prevented the ship's flight computer from loading the correct launch time from its counterpart aboard the Atlas 5.\n\nAs a result, a required orbit insertion burn did not happen on time and because of unrelated communications issues, flight controllers were unable to regain control in time to press ahead with a space station rendezvous.\n\nThe software problems were addressed after the Starliner's landing, along with a variety of other issues that came to light in a post-flight review. Boeing opted to carry out a second test flight, at its own expense, but the company ran into into stuck propulsion system valves in the Starliner's service module. Engineers were unable to resolve the problem and the capsule was taken off its Atlas 5 and hauled back to its processing facility for troubleshooting.\n\nEngineers eventually traced the problem to moisture, presumably from high humidity and torrential rain after rollout to the pad, that chemically reacted with thruster propellant to form corrosion. The corrosion prevented the valves from opening on command.\n\nTo clear the way for launch the following May, the valves in a new service module were replaced and the system was modified to prevent water intrusion on the launch pad. The second Starliner test flight in May 2022 was a success, docking at the space station as planned and returning to Earth with a pinpoint landing.\n\nBut in the wake of the flight, engineers discovered fresh problems: trouble with parachute harness connectors and concern about protective tape wrapped around wiring that could catch fire in a short circuit.\n\nWork to correct those issues pushed the first crewed flight from 2023 to 2024. When all was said and done, Boeing spent more than $1 billion of its own money to pay for the additional test flight and corrective actions.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmony (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Isaacman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Isaacman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/06/16ae1614-d8e2-460e-84c5-0c403c5d38b1/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8ff5311298fe2a2758ad374130fe8463/atlas-padview5.jpg?v=1d6c78a71b7b6252b543a329b3a5744d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 2440, "textEnd": 2446}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 4103, "textEnd": 4111}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 4653, "textEnd": 4666}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The troubled company still has lots of catching up to do.\n\nAt long last, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is ready to launch humans to space. Tonight, the vehicle is due to lift off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, with two NASA astronauts on board, the culmination of a troubled decade of development. Now, Boeing will hope, its own promised era of private human space travel can begin.\n\nThe Crew Flight Test mission is scheduled to launch on an Atlas V rocket at 10:34 pm EST and begin a 25-hour journey to the International Space Station, where its two passengers -- Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams -- will dock and spend about a week on board before returning home. If all goes to plan, beginning next year Starliner will officially enter service as a transportation vehicle for regularly taking humans to and from the ISS. Boeing has six NASA flights contracted, but the potential for more missions too -- perhaps even to other destinations, such as private space stations.\n\n\"Having two different US-crewed vehicles is really important for us,\" said NASA's Dana Weigel, program manager for the ISS, in a news conference on Friday, May 3. \"This crewed flight test is a critical stepping stone to reaching that broader goal.\"\n\nNearly a decade ago, in September 2014, NASA chose two companies -- Boeing and Elon Musk's SpaceX -- to design a new class of private spacecraft that could transport humans to low Earth orbit in the wake of the Space Shuttle's retirement in 2011, \"ending the nation's sole reliance on Russia\" to reach the station, then-NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden said at the time.\n\nThe goal of outsourcing missions to the ISS was allowing NASA to focus on its broader goals of returning humans to the moon (which it hopes to do by 2026 as part of its Artemis program) and eventually to Mars. \"The whole concept is to get to a point where NASA is freed up to think about the next horizon beyond the space station,\" says Daniel Dumbacher, chief executive officer of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\nSpaceX, which received an initial $2.6 billion as part of the program, has already fulfilled its side of the bargain. In 2020, its Crew Dragon spacecraft launched its first humans to space for NASA, and it has since carried nearly 50 people -- both government astronauts and paying customers, such as the US billionaire Jared Isaacman -- into space. Boeing, which received $4.2 billion, has had a much more troubled path with Starliner.\n\nThe vehicle was initially supposed to launch in 2017 but was beset by delays. In 2019, when it finally did launch on an uncrewed test flight, it entered the wrong orbit and failed to reach the ISS. It wouldn't achieve this goal until three years later in 2022, by which time SpaceX had already launched five human spaceflight missions. \"It's been hugely embarrassing for Boeing,\" says Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The issues have been exacerbated by the ongoing issues with the separate aviation branch of the company, including two of the company's Boeing 737 Max planes being lost in accidents in 2018 and 2019, an exit door blowing off one of the planes in January, and multiple whistleblowers -- two of whom subsequently died -- coming forward to air concerns. .", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

And FLORIDA TODAY's Space Team, which consists of award-winning reporter Rick Neale, reporter Brooke Edwards and veteran visuals journalist Craig Bailey, has its own coverage plans complete with a live blog, tweets, video and photos from Cape Canaveral, near Kennedy Space Center and across Brevard County.\n\nWho's the Starliner crew? On board the rocket will be two NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, both Navy test pilots. They have each flown in space twice.\n\nDubbed NASA's Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test Launch for livestreams online, coverage starts at 6:30 p.m. EDT Monday. Keep scrolling for information on the long-anticipated Starliner rocket launch and how to watch our Space Team's coverage on various platforms, from your Android or iPhone to your big screen in your living room.\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft will transport NASA astronauts. The company calls it the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner, or simply \"Starliner.\" Set to launch no earlier than May 6, 2024, it will make history as the first spacecraft to ferry humans from Space Launch Complex 41 in Cape Canaveral. The launch pad has been the site for historic missions beginning with the Titan rockets in 1965 and including the New Horizons deep space probe, the Voyager spacecraft, and even the Curiosity Mars rover.\n\nStarliner will be launched with the help of a United Launch Alliance (a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin) Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V rocket has launched from the site since 2002, but this will be the first time it carries astronauts to space.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying this commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are Navy test pilots. They have each flown in space twice and both bring a wide variety of experiences to the flight.\n\nWilliams was originally a helicopter test pilot before switching to flying jets. She's preparing to fly to space for the third time, as the crew test flight pilot.\n\nThis will be Wilmore's third spaceflight as well. Before becoming a NASA astronaut, Wilmore was a U.S. Navy captain, fighter pilot, and test pilot, accumulating more than 8,000 hours of flight time. Wilmore flew the FA-18 Hornet and T-45 Goshawk, playing a role in missions during Operation Desert Storm, Desert Shield and Southern Watch.\n\nTune in to floridatoday.com/space for USA TODAY Network's Space Team live coverage and updates on the Boeing Starliner rocket launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, starting at 6:30 p.m. EDT Monday.

When Boeing's Starliner capsule lifts off Monday night, this group of three will grow to five. Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both former US Navy test pilots, will be at the controls of Starliner for the ride into low-Earth orbit atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone,\" said Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator. \"The lives of our crew members, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all.\"\n\nAfter liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, Wilmore and Williams will monitor Starliner's systems and take over manual control for a few piloting tests as the spacecraft autonomously approaches the International Space Station. Assuming the launch happens Monday night, docking at the space station is scheduled for early Wednesday. Starliner will remain in orbit at least eight days, with the earliest opportunity to undock and land set for May 15.\n\n\"It's a test pilot's dream -- everything we're doing from start to finish,\" Wilmore said.\n\nIf you start the clock from the day Boeing announced the Starliner program in 2010, this moment is running nearly 10 days behind the company's original schedule.\n\n\"It's a little bit of an emotional roller coaster as things were getting fixed, or you see a couple steps back, but then you see a couple steps forward,\" Williams said. \"We're at that point now. We knew we would get here eventually. It's a solid spacecraft.\"\n\nA test pilot's dream\n\nWilmore, 61, is a native of Tennessee. He will take the left seat in Starliner's cockpit as the commander of the Boeing test flight. Williams, 58, grew up in Massachusetts and will serve as Starliner's pilot. Both astronauts have flown to space twice before and have launched and landed on the space shuttle and Russian Soyuz capsules.\n\nThey are set to join a small club of astronaut test pilots who have hands-on experience piloting a new type of spacecraft in orbit for the first time. Astronauts Doug Hurley, Bob Behnken, and Bob Crippen are the only three Americans alive who can make that claim. Hurley and Behnken flew on the first astronaut mission on SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, and Crippen piloted the first space shuttle mission in 1981 alongside commander John Young, who died in 2018. Yang Liwei, the first astronaut to fly on China's Shenzhou spacecraft in 2003, rounds out the global club.\n\nArs spoke with Hurley, Behnken, and Crippen in the days before the first crew flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to get to fly a brand-new spaceship, which is awesome,\" Hurley said. \"Those don't come around very often.\"\n\nHurley and Behnken retired from NASA's astronaut corps after their 2020 mission and now work for Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. Crippen, now 86, left the agency in 1995 after a stint as director of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nThis will be the first time anyone has ever flown on Starliner, and the first crew launch aboard an Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V's 99 previous flights have all lofted satellites or deployed NASA probes heading into deep space. Hurley and Behnken's flight with SpaceX in 2020 was on the 85th launch of a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nCrippen's experience was vastly different. The space shuttle never launched without people in it, and the first flight of Columbia, known as STS-1, might have been the riskiest mission ever undertaken by NASA. In retrospect, NASA officials calculated there was a 1-in-12 chance that a catastrophic failure on the STS-1 mission could have killed the crew.\n\n\"Butch and Suni are going up on the Atlas V, which is a pretty reliable booster, whereas John and I had a completely experimental spacecraft,\" Crippen said. \"They both are very experienced astronauts, and they're well-qualified to do this.\"\n\nCrippen met with the Starliner crew at the space center in Florida a few months ago, when he got a chance to see the Starliner spacecraft up close. \"Seeing it reminded me a lot of the command module we had from Apollo,\" he said.\n\nThe first Starliner crew has trained together nearly four years. Wilmore replaced the mission's original commander in 2020, and Williams has been assigned to the Boeing commercial crew program since 2018.\n\n\"My advice is know the spacecraft as well as you can,\" Crippen said. \"I think they're well prepared. They've had a considerable amount of time ... with the delays they've had.\"", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.Boeing's spaceflight program may reach a significant milestone Monday night with the launch of its Starliner spacecraft, carrying -- at long last -- two NASA astronauts to orbit.The mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could take off as soon as Monday at 10:34 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.Live coverage of the event will stream on NASA channels beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET Monday, according to the space agency.The occasion is a decade in the making -- the culmination of Boeing's efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner's path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing's rival under NASA's commercial crew program -- SpaceX -- has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency's astronauts.Now, NASA and Boeing have finally deemed the Starliner spacecraft ready for its ultimate test: allowing astronauts to test-drive the vehicle in outer space.Veteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be on board Monday's mission, riding Starliner to the International Space Station for a weeklong stay.Throughout their flight, Wilmore and Williams will conduct a series of tests, including briefly taking over the controls of the autonomous spacecraft and evaluating how the vehicle operates for astronauts.A smooth flight could be a winning moment for Boeing's spaceflight program and the company overall, which has been in the hotseat due to issues with its commercial airplane division.H ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 61}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

When the flight finally took place, a series of malfunctions meant the capsule never reached the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nA second uncrewed test flight was planned for August 2021 and was delayed until May 2022. The flight reached completion but raised issues about thrusters and the capsule's cooling system.\n\n'Lessons learned'\n\nAs Boeing's system went $1 billion (\u00a3800m) over budget, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has carried out 13 piloted missions since 2020, carrying 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit.\n\nMission managers say all known issues have now been corrected, while upgrades and improvements have been implemented and the capsule has been thoroughly tested to verify its readiness.\n\nMission commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said he has \"full confidence\" in mission management, NASA and Boeing.\n\n\"There have been some issues in the past. That's the past. That is not now,\" he said.\n\nCo-pilot Sunita Williams, like Wilmore a former Navy test pilot, said, \"I feel like we've had a lot of lessons learned, and they've been incorporated... We wouldn't say we're ready if we weren't ready.\"\n\nTest flight\n\nWilmore and Williams have four space flights, 11 spacewalks and 500 days in orbit between them, flying into space aboard Space Shuttle and Russia's Soyuz ferry ships.\n\nThe astronauts are to test Boeing's new blue space suits, which are about 40 percent lighter than earlier generations, are more flexible and have touchscreen-sensitive gloves.\n\nStarliner is due to be docked with the ISS for about 10 days before returning to Earth, where it is to touch down on land somewhere in the southwestern US.\n\nIf the mission is successful Starliner is to be certified for regular crew missions to the space station, with its next mission possibly taking four crew, equipment and supplies into orbit early next year.\n\nRead also : Russia Warns US Over SpaceX 'Spy Satellites'", "source": {"uri": "silicon.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Silicon UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_broersma@silicon.co.uk",

They are expected to launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, sending the new Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station.\n\nBarring any bad weather or other last-minute hiccups, the test flight could lift off as early as 10:34 p.m. ET on May 6.\n\n\"When we lay back on our backs on Monday evening, it's going to be real stuff, and the countdown is gonna be real, and it's gonna be a really thrilling time,\" said Wilmore, the crew commander.\n\nHere's how to watch this historic event.\n\nBeginning two days before the planned liftoff time, NASA will host a live video feed of the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. The official pre-launch broadcast will begin at about 6:30 p.m. ET on May 6, about four hours prior to launch.\n\nBoeing's Starliner has faced years of delays after NASA hired the company in 2014 to build a spaceship, along with SpaceX. The spacecraft has flown two times previously without any astronauts inside. During the first uncrewed test in 2019, the ship got on the wrong orbit due to software problems and didn't make it to the space station. The company did a redo of the test in 2022, which NASA largely viewed as successful.\n\nBut getting to its first flight with humans on board has been a struggle. Boeing wanted to do the crewed test flight last year, but flammable interior tape and parachute lines that didn't meet safety standards stymied the launch, putting it off to 2024.\n\nDespite the setbacks, NASA says Starliner is ready to fly humans.

Its airline business is under pressure because of a series of accidents. And the firm's space sector is also under scrutiny following difficulties in developing Starliner itself.\n\n\"It's a really big day for Boeing\", commented Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University.\n\n\"The company has been working on the spacecraft for so long, they have had a few problems with the test flights and there's a lot riding on this\".\n\nStarliner was originally due to have its first uncrewed test flight in 2015 but this was delayed until 2019. When it did occur, software glitches led to an internal clock malfunction, resulting in thrusters over-firing. So much fuel was consumed that the capsule couldn't reach the space station.\n\nA second attempt was planned in August 2021 but delayed again until May 2022. An issue with the propulsion system was blamed. When Starliner did finally get off Earth, it managed to complete its full mission but concerns were then later raised about the performance of some thrusters and the craft's cooling system.\n\nCorrecting these faults and additional issues to do with the safety of wiring and parachutes pushed the first crewed demonstration back to where we are today.\n\nNasa and Boeing would not have given the go ahead for astronauts to fly the mission unless they were certain all the glitches had been sorted out. And the launch will be aborted if there is any sign of problems with the spacecraft.\n\nAt a pre-flight news conference, a reporter put it to the Navy-trained astronauts that the setbacks must make their flight \"scary\" for friends and family.\n\nBarry \"Butch\" Wilmore said it would be wrong to describe the various technical issues as \"setbacks\".\n\n\"We'd call them steps forward. We find an issue and rectify that and we have articulated that to our families so that they understand that,\" he added.\n\nAnd Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, who will pilot the spacecraft, commented: \"We are all here because we are all ready. Our friends and family have heard about it and we've talked about it and they are happy and proud that we are part of the process to fix it all.\"\n\nWhen Nasa announced that SpaceX and Boeing would take over from the old space shuttles, it gave them both a similar contract, one that would bring their capsules into service and then pay for six operational missions. The SpaceX contract was worth $2.6bn while Boeing got $4.2bn. SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020. This means Boeing is four years behind. The company has also spent a lot of money to put things right.\n\nDr Barber said SpaceX and other start-ups had a new approach to technology development that led to greater innovation.\n\n\"You have a traditional space company (in Boeing) that has been around a long time and does things in a certain way and you have a new space company which has done things in a different way, by building, testing, crashing, learning and then building again and so their development cycle is very rapid,\" he told BBC News.\n\nBoeing's commercial crew programme manager Mark Nappi told reporters at a news conference that finding faults in test flights was a normal part of the process in developing a new spacecraft.\n\n\"Design and development has constant ups and downs, but the overall slope is always up. So that is where we have got to today. We are basically at the top of that slope\".\n\nThe arrival of Boeing's spacecraft into service will mean competition for SpaceX which should bring down costs, according to Libby Jackson, who is the head of space exploration for the UK Space Agency.\n\n\"That is really important not just for Nasa, but for other space agencies, such as the UK Space Agency, because we are spending the taxpayers' money getting our astronauts to the ISS and we want the best value for money,\" she said.\n\nStarliner is 5m tall and 4.6m wide (16.5ft by 15ft), when attached to its rear service module. It's wider than the capsule used in the Apollo missions. There's room for up to seven astronauts, although it will probably fly routinely with just four. It's intended to be reusable and fly up to 10 times.\n\nThe spacecraft launch at in the early hours of Tuesday morning should see it cross the southwest of the UK about 20 minutes after lift-off.\n\nDuring the journey to the ISS, the crew will test seats, assess onboard life-support and navigation systems, as well as evaluating the system that moves cargo into the ISS.\n\nThey will also be testing brand new space suits. Wilmore and Williams will be wearing Boeing's blue suit, which is about 40% lighter than earlier generations of spacesuits worn by American astronauts - and more flexible. The suit also has touchscreen-sensitive gloves, so the astronauts can work with tablets in the spacecraft.\n\nStarliner will be docked with the ISS for around 10 days before returning to Earth. Unlike re-entries by previous US capsules that splashed down in the sea, Starliner will touch down on land somewhere in the southwestern United States. A heatshield and parachutes will slow the descent before airbags open to soften the moment of impact with the ground.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Starliner will be certified for regular crew missions to the ISS. Its next launch - most probably early next year - will carry four astronauts as well as equipment and supplies.\n\nThere have been more than a hundred crewed missions to the ISS since the start of its construction in 1998. But, according to Caleb Henry, of the US-based space consultancy firm Quilty, the Starliner launch marks an important moment in the history of spaceflight.\n\n\"We are now entering a new era of human exploration,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"What is exciting is the growing role of the private sector. It's increasing the frequency of space travel, which is creating new opportunities.\"", "source": {"uri": "au.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

If successful, Monday's week-long test mission will lead to six further astronaut rotation flights to the space station that Nasa has ordered as part of its commercial crew program.\n\n\"No matter what is going on around us, no matter how difficult the situation, the people on this team just keep their heads down doing the things that, in the moment, can feel impossible,\" Aaron Kraftcheck, senior manager for Starliner's flight software, design and development, told reporters last month.\n\n\"The whole company has rallied around us. I get emotional talking about it.\"\n\nThe Starliner capsule, officially called CST-100 (crew space transportation), has interior space similar to a midsize SUV, and has a capacity of seven, although it will be configured for four astronauts and cargo for space station flights.\n\nEach capsule can be flown up to 10 times, Boeing says, with a six-month turnaround between each mission. Innovation includes Starliner's weldless design, which reduces the risk of structural failure, and highly developed software that allows the spacecraft to fly, navigate and course-correct autonomously.\n\nIt means the American astronauts onboard Monday's flight, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, each veterans of three space shuttle missions, will mostly be monitoring its progress in communication with ground crews, but can step in to take over manually if needed.\n\n\"To do the cool stuff that Starliner does, there is lots of complexity in the system and in each component,\" Kraftcheck said. \"The most challenging and rewarding part is figuring out how to make it all work together.\n\n\"[It's] like an orchestra. Starliner has many instruments playing different, complicated parts, but it's the timing and interaction between each instrument that is especially critical.\"\n\nBoeing showcased the capsule during a final uncrewed test mission in May 2022, its successful docking with the space station making it the second US-built, human-capable spacecraft to reach the outpost after SpaceX's Dragon.\n\nThe astronauts have been in quarantine at the Kennedy Space Center since 25 April to prepare for Monday's flight, but their overall wait has been much longer. Williams was assigned to the flight in 2018, and Wilmore upgraded from a backup role two years later.\n\nWilmore said the delays had only helped them become more familiar with the capsule, and prepared for the challenges of the mission.\n\n\"We've been through training and we have our fingerprints on every single procedure that exists for this spacecraft,\" he told a virtual press conference from Cape Canaveral.\n\n\"We're fully trained in all aspects of Starliner.\"\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source": {"uri": "businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.businesstelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boeing-hopes-to-polish-its-reputation-with-Starliner-crew-capsule.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 3363, "textEnd": 3371}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

You can watch the action live at Space.com, courtesy of NASA.\n\nThe liftoff will kick off Crew Flight Test (CFT), a roughly 10-day shakeout cruise to the International Space Station (ISS) that will be Starliner's first-ever astronaut mission. Such crewed debuts to Earth orbit have happened just five times in American history, as NASA chief Bill Nelson noted during a press briefing on Friday (May 3).\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Elon Musk's company has since completed seven operational astronaut missions to the station, and it's in the middle of its eighth, which launched in March. As that record shows, SpaceX has proven to be a reliable and prolific partner for NASA. But the agency is still excited to get a second American astronaut taxi online, given how complex and demanding human spaceflight is.\n\n\"This will give us that additional capability, because we always look for a backup,\" Nelson said.\n\nIf all goes well with CFT, Starliner could launch its first contracted, six-month crewed mission to the ISS as soon as early 2025.\n\nCFT's launch will be historic in other ways as well. For example, it will be the first-ever astronaut liftoff for the venerable Atlas V, and the first crew-carrying mission for any member of the Atlas rocket family since May 15, 1963. On that day, an Atlas LV-3B launched Faith 7, the final mission of the Mercury program, which sent NASA astronaut Gordon Cooper into orbit for 34 hours and 20 minutes.Nelson also noted another special aspect of tonight's liftoff: It will mark the first time since the May 1968 launch of Apollo 7 that a crewed mission leaves Earth from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (or, in its former incarnation, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station).Many astronaut missions have lifted off from Florida's Space Coast since then, including those flown by NASA's space shuttle and SpaceX's Dragon. But those flights all launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, which is next door to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.", "source": {"uri": "scientificamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scientific American"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_wall@scientificamerican.com", "name": "Mike Wall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crew Dragon Demo-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_LV-3B", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas LV-3B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Cooper"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/2dd93b122d706271/original/GettyImages-2150967661.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 192, "textEnd": 197}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 459, "textEnd": 464}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 861, "textEnd": 866}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 1873, "textEnd": 1881}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-05-", "textStart": 2714, "textEnd": 2720}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

After a scheduled May 1 launch was pushed back a few weeks ago, Monday should be the day for Boeing's space exploration moonshot.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nThe Starliner is Boeing's attempt to join the field of space tourism by providing a space shuttle replacement that can go to space and come back. It's a competitor for similar offerings from Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. One notable feature of the Starliner, showcased during previous test flights, is that it can return to Earth on land instead of in the ocean.\n\nStarliner is scheduled to launch with NASA astronauts aboard for the first time on Monday at 10:34 p.m. local time from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. It will be the first time the Starliner has had a manned flight. It's heading to the International Space Station and coming back. Crews have been making preparations for weeks. The National Weather Service says the conditions Monday are expected to mostly sunny with a chance of thunderstorms.\n\nAs for the actual launch, which you can watch on this livestream provided by Boeing, a rocket will shoot the Starliner into space. If everything goes according to plan, the Starliner will make its way to the International Space Station and dock there. Later, it will return to Earth and parachute to a spot in either New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range, Willcox, Arizona, the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, or Edwards Air Force Base in California.\n\nThe crew will consist of Navy aviators Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Pilot Sunita \"Suni\" Williams.\n\nBoeing first announced the Starliner in 2010. It was originally supposed to operational by 2015, but that expectation came and went a long time ago. The project has faced a number of delays over the years, from struggles fitting it on top of a rocket to software problems.\n\nNASA's contract with Boeing to develop the Starliner was for $4.6 billion. But because it has taken so long and had so many problems, Bloomberg reports that Boeing has actually lost $1.5 billion developing the craft.\n\nEver since a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airline-operated 737 Max 9 in January, Boeing has been dealing with headache after headache. A successful launch would be a needed win for the troubled company.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The new spacecraft which is equipped with NASA's Advanced Composite Solar Sail System has been utilising sunlight for propulsion. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket was launched from New Zealand at 3:30 am IST, and it is further said that it is set to be installed 1,000 kilometres above Earth.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saumya_nigam@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Saumya Nigam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-rating_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human-rating certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacques Cousteau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab_Electron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Lab Electron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/05/sunita-williams-1714983098.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 265, "textEnd": 270}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 1846, "textEnd": 1854}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

A NASA team in Mission Control took control of Starliner, just like during the real event, and simulated a countdown all the way to liftoff.\n\n\"This is a big weekend for NASA ... and it's not just because we're putting our friends on it on a new spaceship,\" Canadian Space Agency astronaut Josh Kutryk told Space.com in a phone interview from nearby the press center here. He is assigned to the crucial capcom (capsule communicator) position as the United Launch Alliance Atlas V spacecraft flies towards Earth orbit.\n\nRelated: Watch ULA assemble Atlas V rocket ahead of Boeing Starliner astronaut test flight (video)\n\n\"This is important strategically,\" Kutryk added, noting the approximately 10-day-long CFT aims to certify a second commercial spacecraft to bring NASA astronauts regularly to the International Space Station (ISS). \"This is the second big piece of America's overall strategy for access to low Earth orbit after implementing [SpaceX's] Dragon.\"\n\nThe mission is manifested to launch on Monday at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 GMT Tuesday, May 7) from the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, at United Launch Alliance's Pad 41.\n\nCrew Flight Test (CFT) astronaut crew Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be the first NASA astronauts and humans aboard Starliner, as well as the Atlas V rocket.\n\nOn April 26, the CFT crew -- both former U.S. Navy test pilots as well -- joined Mission Control in doing another prelaunch test in which the crew donned suits, walked out from quarantine here at the NASA Kennedy Space Center and went all the way to their launch pad at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nThe CFT astronauts won't be joining them this time, as they have other tasks to turn to ahead of ascent. But Kutryk's presence is notable: not only is he capcom during CFT's launch, but he is also one the astronauts aboard the first operational six-month spacecraft mission, Starliner-1, set to launch to the ISS no earlier than 2025.\n\nDuring Sunday's launch simulation exercise, \"We'll do a series of test items where we're basically putting power on to the Atlas V and Starliner stack on Pad 41,\" Kutryk said. \"We're looking into some of these systems, testing the comm system, for example, and just making sure we're all completely ready to go.\"\n\nAfter spending all day on console practicing on Sunday, the launching team will return to the White Flight Control Room at JSC around 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) on Monday for the big event. \"It's super exciting,\" Kutryk said of the launch. That's because NASA will be managing a launch from JSC and White Flight for the first time since the space shuttle program concluded in 2011. (SpaceX manages its own launches from an independent center in Hawthorne, California.)\n\nShortly after arriving, the team will take control of the vehicle from Boeing and go through system power-ups and fueling. Whitmore and Wilmore will make their way to the pad and get strapped in roughly three hours before launch, too.\n\n\"I'll be talking to them [the crew], talking to their personnel who are strapping them in, making sure that the complex systems are working, and also that all this simple stuff is working,\" Kutryk said. \"You'll hear us talking about, 'Can you reach this? Can you reach that? And we'll be doing pressure checks on the vehicle, pressure checks on the suits. Hundreds of pages of technical verification procedures.\"\n\nThrough launch, part of what the team will monitor is whether they need to abort at several sites in the Atlantic Ocean. Assuming all goes to plan, Starliner will be authorized to do an orbital insertion engine burn about roughly 31 minutes after launch. Kutryk said that moment will be \"really critical for the whole mission\" because it will put the astronauts in a \"sustainable, safe orbit. After that, we have a lot more options, a lot more flexibility, a lot more time to deal with anything ... that's really the job of this ascent team.\"\n\nAssuming all is going well at that point, the ascent team will then hand over their Mission Control positions to another team. Kutryk will remain on call for the rest of the mission and naturally, will begin shifting focus even more to Starliner-1 as that launch date approaches in 2021. Starliner-1 commander Mike Fincke, of NASA, is backup to the CFT astronauts and is quarantining with the CFT crew until launch. Also on Starliner-1 is NASA's Scott Tingle.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n-- 2 astronaut taxis: Why NASA wants both Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon\n\n-- Boeing's Starliner crew capsule channels R2-D2 ahead of astronaut test flight\n\n-- NASA, Boeing delay Starliner capsule's 1st astronaut launch to early May\n\nKurtyk said the next Starliner mission will include a new physical capsule that is inside the Boeing building right now: \"It looks very much ready to go,\" he said. The crew has fully certified themselves for ISS operations, allowing themselves to focus on remaining Starliner-1 tasks in the coming months.\n\nStarliner's program is taking a \"build-up\" approach, to use the lingo of flight testing, that is gradually shifting from uncrewed missions to CFT and then to Starliner-1. (Starliner required two uncrewed missions after software glitches on the first attempt in 2019 stranded the spacecraft in the wrong orbit and it did not reach the ISS. But the second attempt in 2022 made it well.)\n\nAssuming CFT certifies as planned, \"that changes the calculus, it changes the discussion around a lot of risk items, around a lot of system items,\" Kurtyk said. Redesigned software is coming that allows future crews to dock at more ports than a single one at the ISS Harmony module, which is the case right now. The crew will also want to ensure that Starliner can power down for months at the ISS, instead of the few days CFT requires.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Space_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Space Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_D._Tingle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott D.

The University of Tennessee at Knoxville alum's main priority is serving as commander during the first crewed mission of the Boeing Starliner, which will take him and pilot Sunita \"Suni\" Williams to the International Space Station.\n\nAnd depending on how things go, the test flight could make the Starliner a routine ferry for the space agency.\n\nIt's all finally happening at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station after years of delays. While SpaceX continues to fly its Crew Dragon spacecraft, Starliner experienced some problems with an early test flight and has been lagging behind.\n\nThis will be the third trip to the International Space Station for Wilmore, a retired U.S. Navy captain with more than 8,000 flight hours in tactical jets. Before joining NASA in 2000, Wilmore flew missions in operations Desert Storm, Desert Shield and Southern Watch.\n\nWilmore was a pilot on shuttle Atlantis' STS-129 mission in 2009 and commanded Expedition 42 for six months in 2014 and 2015. The 61-year-old Mount Juliet native graduated with a master's degree in aviation systems from the UT Space Institute in 1994.\n\n\"I am a Tennessean at heart,\" he told UT's Tickle College of Engineering. \"That's home, and you might see a Tennessee item or two while I'm up there.\"\n\nThe May 6 launch marks the spacecraft's final test flight to \"validate the transportation system ... and return to Earth with astronauts aboard,\" according to NASA.\n\nWilmore and Williams will spend about a week on the International Space Station before returning with the help of parachutes and airbags in the western U.S.\n\nWilmore's first word as a child was not \"mom\" or \"dad,\" he said on a March episode of NASA's \"Houston We Have a Podcast.\" It was \"why.\"\n\n\"I was always questioning everything,\" he said, including what it must be like to visit outer space.\n\nIt took Wilmore three applications just to get an interview with NASA, but even then he wasn't selected. The fourth time was the charm, moving past the interview stage all the way to astronaut.\n\nWilmore was selected by NASA for the astronaut corps in 2000 and has since flown to space twice, spending 178 combined days off Earth. He was assigned his upcoming mission in October 2020, replacing astronaut Chris Ferguson as commander. Ferguson stepped down from the flight due to family commitments.\n\nWilmore has two daughters, Daryn and Logan, and serves as a pastor for Providence Baptist Church in Pasadena, Texas. He is a fan of musicals and plans to play music on the way to the ISS, according to a March statement from Boeing.\n\nWilliams, his fellow Starliner crew member, said she might ask him to sing during the journey. After all, you have to find some way to pass the approximately 24-hour trip.\n\nWilliams earned her B.S. in physical science from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1987 and earned her M.S. in engineering science from Florida Tech in 1995. Her accomplishments as a helicopter pilot include deployments to the Mediterranean, Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to support Desert Shield and Operation Provide Comfort, according to her NASA bio.\n\nSelected by NASA in June 1998, Williams assisted with the early collaboration between NASA and the Russian Space Agency on the International Space Station before shifting to working with the Robotics branch for the ISS Robotic Arm.\n\nDuring her two spaceflights, Williams completed seven spacewalks. All in all, she has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space.\n\nWilliams has been waiting nearly a decade for this mission.\n\nBoth SpaceX and Boeing were awarded contracts to fly NASA crews back in 2014, but it wasn't until 2020 that SpaceX began successfully flying crewed missions - three years after what was hoped.\n\n\"It's been tough watching our SpaceX colleagues fly again and again,\" Williams said. \"But that fact has made us the Starliner crew.\"\n\nWith the extra time, she and Wilmore have been able to learn more about the vehicle while interacting with each other and the team at Boeing over the past two years.\n\nIf you want to watch live rocket launch coverage, FLORIDA TODAY's Space Team will provide updates at floridatoday.com/space, starting about 90 minutes before launch time.

It was originally supposed to operational by 2015, but that expectation came and went a long time ago. The project has faced a number of delays over the years, from struggles fitting it on top of a rocket to software problems.\n\nNASA's contract with Boeing to develop the Starliner was for $4.6 billion.

We are the ones working with the engineering team to make all of that happen.\"\n\nA United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket will carry the Starliner and its crew into space. A parachute and airbag-assisted landing is scheduled in the southwestern United States.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will suit up in their flight suits 5 hours before launch to prevent nitrogen narcosis during the launch.\n\nThey also have their pre-flight plans for entertainment while on their way to the launch pad.\n\nThey'll travel to the launch pad in a customized and appropriately named Airstream Astrovan II.\n\n\"It's epic,\" Wilmore said of the Astrovan. \"It's got a big video screen in the back.\"\n\n\"As you would expect [from] two Navy test pilots, you know what movie we put on,\" he said. \"Of course it's Top Gun: Maverick,\" but edited to only include the flight and dramatic scenes.\n\nWilmore said they'll watch it again on the trip back after touching down in the Desert Southwest to conclude their return from the shakedown mission.\n\nThe Starliner's first manned mission originally was planned to occur four years earlier, but a test mission in 2019 failed to reach the International Space Station.\n\nA 2022 test flight accomplished that feat, but neither of those test flights carried a flight crew. Monday's planned launch will be the first to have humans on board.\n\nA series of software and hardware failures doomed the unmanned 2019 test flight, but it landed successfully at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.\n\nBoeing engineers identified the problems that caused the first mission to fail and applied more than 80 fixes.\n\nThe improvements enabled the Starliner to successfully reach orbit, dock with the space station and return six days later with another successful landing in New Mexico during the 2022 mission.\n\nAdditional delays prevented the Starliner's first manned launch due to problems with the spacecraft's parachute lines and the discovery of flammable tape that might create a fire hazard inside the spacecraft.\n\nNASA engineers said other issues also delayed the first manned mission, but they ironed out the wrinkles with Williams and Wilmore's help.\n\nNASA initially allocated $4.2 billion to Boeing to design and build the Starliner, and Boeing spent another $1.5 billion while developing it.\n\nThe spacecraft has manual and automatic steering capability and can carry up to four astronauts or a mix of crew and cargo for NASA missions to low-Earth orbit.\n\nIt's designed to spend up to seven months docked at the International Space Station.\n\nA service capsule and the Atlas rocket are expendable, but the crew capsule is designed to be used for up to 10 missions.\n\nWilliams gave the spacecraft its unofficial name, \"Calypso,\" which she chose in honor of legendary French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and his Calypso research vessel.\n\nThe test pilots say they are confident, well-trained and well-fed while preparing for the mission.\n\nUnlike early NASA manned missions, such as the Apollo missions to the moon, Wilmore said theirs won't include any \"black zones\" that would mean certain death if there were any failures while in those zones while heading for orbit, as was the case in prior space shuttle and Soyuz missions.\n\n\"You could not survive if you had certain failures\" while in a black zone, Wilmore said. \"This spacecraft does not have those.\"\n\nHe said the Starliner will get them to the space station and back \"with pinpoint accuracy,\" which is needed because their chosen landing zone is a 4-kilometer circle in the southwestern United States.\n\nThey also have complete control to abort the mission.\n\n\"We can abort from the pad all the way through orbit,\" Williams said. \"That capability is great. We're on the tippety-top end, so we'll be OK.\"\n\nWilliams said it was an honor for her and Wilmore to have participated in space shuttle and Soyuz missions and for them to bring that experience into a new space program.\n\nIf the mission launches as planned Monday night and returns successfully, NASA will certify the capsule it for future missions.\n\nThat certification could make Boeing a direct competitor to SpaceX, which has developed its commercial flight program that enables tourists to enter low-Earth orbit and return.\n\nBoeing hasn't announced plans for any commercial tourism adventures to space, but a successful mission would ensure potential competition for SpaceX.", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

NASA should start streaming its coverage at 6:30PM ET on its YouTube channel, with the official launch set for 10:34PM ET. The spacecraft will carry two astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore.\n\nWe say \"most likely\" because the road to this day has not been a smooth one. It was a decade ago that NASA first chose Boeing and Space X to construct spacecraft that would fly from the United States to the ISS. Boeing received a $4.2 billion contract, while NASA gave SpaceX $2.6 billion. Yet, the latter had its first successful crewed flight in 2020 and has replicated it about a dozen times since.\n\nBoeing's Starliner failed to reach orbit during its first uncrewed orbital test flight in 2019 due to too much fuel burning. A follow-up flight was scheduled for August 2021 but was scrapped due to a valve issue, with Boeing finally reaching the ISS in spring 2022 with an uncrewed vessel. Two plans for crewed flights came and went, amongst faults in aspects such as the parachute system. Last August, Boeing announced it should have these issues straightened out by March 2024.\n\nIt's now two months later than that initial goal and Boeing, Williams and Wilmore seem prepared for take off. \"We are ready, the spacecraft's ready and the teams are ready,\" Wilmore told the press. NASA associate administrator Jim Free added: \"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone. The lives of our crewmembers Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are at stake -- we don't take that lightly at all.\"", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/byKGdmf7gOEhFmBYtnWRvA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/9fa7ea40-0b91-11ef-bd6a-ebaafc62fbcb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

We are the ones working with the engineering team to make all of that happen.\"\n\nA United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket will carry the Starliner and its crew into space. A parachute and airbag-assisted landing is scheduled in the southwestern United States.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will suit up in their flight suits 5 hours before launch to prevent nitrogen narcosis during the launch.\n\nThey also have their pre-flight plans for entertainment while on their way to the launch pad.\n\nThey'll travel to the launch pad in a customized and appropriately named Airstream Astrovan II.\n\n\"It's epic,\" Wilmore said of the Astrovan. \"It's got a big video screen in the back.\"\n\n\"As you would expect [from] two Navy test pilots, you know what movie we put on,\" he said. \"Of course it's Top Gun: Maverick,\" but edited to only include the flight and dramatic scenes.\n\nWilmore said they'll watch it again on the trip back after touching down in the Desert Southwest to conclude their return from the shakedown mission.\n\nThe Starliner's first manned mission originally was planned to occur four years earlier, but a test mission in 2019 failed to reach the International Space Station.\n\nA 2022 test flight accomplished that feat, but neither of those test flights carried a flight crew. Monday's planned launch will be the first to have humans on board.\n\nA series of software and hardware failures doomed the unmanned 2019 test flight, but it landed successfully at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.\n\nBoeing engineers identified the problems that caused the first mission to fail and applied more than 80 fixes.\n\nThe improvements enabled the Starliner to successfully reach orbit, dock with the space station and return six days later with another successful landing in New Mexico during the 2022 mission.\n\nAdditional delays prevented the Starliner's first manned launch due to problems with the spacecraft's parachute lines and the discovery of flammable tape that might create a fire hazard inside the spacecraft.\n\nNASA engineers said other issues also delayed the first manned mission, but they ironed out the wrinkles with Williams and Wilmore's help.\n\nNASA initially allocated $4.2 billion to Boeing to design and build the Starliner, and Boeing spent another $1.5 billion while developing it.\n\nThe spacecraft has manual and automatic steering capability and can carry up to four astronauts or a mix of crew and cargo for NASA missions to low-Earth orbit.\n\nIt's designed to spend up to seven months docked at the International Space Station.\n\nA service capsule and the Atlas rocket are expendable, but the crew capsule is designed to be used for up to 10 missions.\n\nWilliams gave the spacecraft its unofficial name, \"Calypso,\" which she chose in honor of legendary French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and his Calypso research vessel.\n\nThe test pilots say they are confident, well-trained and well-fed while preparing for the mission.\n\nUnlike early NASA manned missions, such as the Apollo missions to the moon, Wilmore said theirs won't include any \"black zones\" that would mean certain death if there were any failures while in those zones while heading for orbit, as was the case in prior space shuttle and Soyuz missions.\n\n\"You could not survive if you had certain failures\" while in a black zone, Wilmore said. \"This spacecraft does not have those.\"\n\nHe said the Starliner will get them to the space station and back \"with pinpoint accuracy,\" which is needed because their chosen landing zone is a 4-kilometer circle in the southwestern United States.\n\nThey also have complete control to abort the mission.\n\n\"We can abort from the pad all the way through orbit,\" Williams said. \"That capability is great. We're on the tippety-top end, so we'll be OK.\"\n\nWilliams said it was an honor for her and Wilmore to have participated in space shuttle and Soyuz missions and for them to bring that experience into a new space program.\n\nIf the mission launches as planned Monday night and returns successfully, NASA will certify the capsule it for future missions.\n\nThat certification could make Boeing a direct competitor to SpaceX, which has developed its commercial flight program that enables tourists to enter low-Earth orbit and return.\n\nBoeing hasn't announced plans for any commercial tourism adventures to space, but a successful mission would ensure potential competition for SpaceX.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The mission, which has been delayed for years due to developmental issues, is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 10:34pm local time on Monday (8:04am IST on Tuesday). If successful, Boeing will become the second private company after SpaceX capable of transporting crews to and from the ISS.\n\nThis mission is particularly significant for Boeing, which has been scrutinized in aviation and space sectors following a series of mishaps and hurdles in Starliner's development. Dr. Simeon Barber, Open University space scientist, emphasized the importance of this event for Boeing stating, \"It's a really big day for Boeing.\" \"The company has been working on the spacecraft for so long, they have had a few problems with the test flights and there's a lot riding on this,\" he added.\n\nOriginally, Starliner was scheduled to embark on its first uncrewed test flight in 2015. However, software issues causing an internal clock malfunction led to a delay until 2019. This glitch resulted in thrusters over-firing and using up so much fuel that the capsule couldn't reach the space station. A second attempt was planned in August 2021 but was postponed again until May 2022 due to problems with the propulsion system.\n\nDespite past issues, NASA and Boeing have approved astronauts to undertake the mission after ensuring all problems have been resolved. The crew includes seasoned NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Addressing concerns about the technical issues, Wilmore said, \"We'd call them steps forward. We find an issue and rectify that.\" Williams, who will pilot the spacecraft, said, \"We are all here because we are all ready.\"\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's commercial crew program manager, expressed at a news conference that encountering issues during test flights is a typical part of developing a new spacecraft. He stated, \"Design and development has constant ups and downs, but the overall slope is always up.\" According to Nappi, they are now at the top of that slope with Starliner's development.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_space_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outline of space science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circadian rhythm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l76120240506152104.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

If successful, Monday's week-long test mission will lead to six further astronaut rotation flights to the space station that Nasa has ordered as part of its commercial crew program.\n\n\"No matter what is going on around us, no matter how difficult the situation, the people on this team just keep their heads down doing the things that, in the moment, can feel impossible,\" Aaron Kraftcheck, senior manager for Starliner's flight software, design and development, told reporters last month.\n\n\"The whole company has rallied around us. I get emotional talking about it.\"\n\nThe Starliner capsule, officially called CST-100 (crew space transportation), has interior space similar to a midsize SUV, and has a capacity of seven, although it will be configured for four astronauts and cargo for space station flights.\n\nEach capsule can be flown up to 10 times, Boeing says, with a six-month turnaround between each mission. Innovation includes Starliner's weldless design, which reduces the risk of structural failure, and highly developed software that allows the spacecraft to fly, navigate and course-correct autonomously.\n\nIt means the American astronauts onboard Monday's flight, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, each veterans of three space shuttle missions, will mostly be monitoring its progress in communication with ground crews, but can step in to take over manually if needed.\n\n\"To do the cool stuff that Starliner does, there is lots of complexity in the system and in each component,\" Kraftcheck said. \"The most challenging and rewarding part is figuring out how to make it all work together.\n\n\"[It's] like an orchestra. Starliner has many instruments playing different, complicated parts, but it's the timing and interaction between each instrument that is especially critical.\"\n\nBoeing showcased the capsule during a final uncrewed test mission in May 2022, its successful docking with the space station making it the second US-built, human-capable spacecraft to reach the outpost after SpaceX's Dragon.\n\nThe astronauts have been in quarantine at the Kennedy Space Center since 25 April to prepare for Monday's flight, but their overall wait has been much longer. Williams was assigned to the flight in 2018, and Wilmore upgraded from a backup role two years later.\n\nWilmore said the delays had only helped them become more familiar with the capsule, and prepared for the challenges of the mission.\n\n\"We've been through training and we have our fingerprints on every single procedure that exists for this spacecraft,\" he told a virtual press conference from Cape Canaveral.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

(WHDH) - A New England native is set to take flight Monday night on the first human spaceflight for Boeing's new Starliner capsule.\n\nThe US aerospace giant is scheduled to launch its capsule toward the International Space Station from Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\n\"This is the first launch of astronauts for Boeing as part of NASA's commercial crew program and I know that they are very excited...to fly to the International Space Station on his historic mission,\" said Jennifer Kunz at the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nBoeing previously gave the Starliner capsule two test flights. But software problems and parachute issues plagued its development.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts now assigned to Boeing's launch are retired Navy captains Butch Wilmore and Needham native Sunita Williams.\n\nCurrently serving as test pilots, the duo has been involved in the Starliner capsule's development. They insist the capsule is ready for primetime.\n\n\"I honestly think it's a great stepping stone as we're getting ready to leave low Earth orbit and go back to the Moon,\" Williams said.\n\nBack in Massachusetts, where her hometown named an elementary school after her in 2019, many young students look up to Williams.\n\nWilliams has been a pioneer for women in science, making four spacewalks totaling 29 hours during her 195 day stay at the International Space Station in 2006. Both her hours spent on spacewalks and the length of her stay were records for women at the time. Williams was also the first person to complete a triathlon and the Boston Marathon from space.\n\nNow, she hopes Boeing's capsule inspires future generations.\n\n\"I think if I was a young astronaut and I was thinking about going to the Moon I think I would put my hand up and say I want to fly Starliner,\" she said.\n\nIf Monday's test flight goes well, NASA could alternate between Boeing and SpaceX when sending astronauts to the ISS.\n\nLiftoff for the Monday flight is scheduled to take place shortly after 10:30 p.m.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

The liftoff is scheduled to take place from the Kennedy Space Center on May 7, 2024, at 8.34 8.04 am India time. She says she is a bit nervous but has no jitters about flying in a new spacecraft. While training at the launch pad, Ms Williams said, \"When I reach the International Space Station, it will be like going back home.\"\n\nBorn to Dr Deepak Pandya and Bonnie Pandya, the 59-year-old will create history by being the first woman to fly on a maiden mission of a new human-rated spacecraft. A qualified navy test pilot, she has flown twice to space in 2006 and 2012, and according to data from NASA, \"Sunita has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space.\"\n\nAt one time she, used to hold the record for maximum spacewalk time by a female astronaut as she has spent 50 hour and 40 minutes across seven spacewalks. NASA says while on board with seven space walks totalling 50 hours and 40 minutes, Sunita held the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut but that has since been overtaken by Peggy Whitson with 10 spacewalks.\n\nSunita Williams's father was a neuroanatomist born in Jhulasan, in Mehsana District, Gujarat, but later migrated to the USA and married Bonnie Pandya, a Slovenian. NASA says she is currently preparing to be the pilot of the Crew Flight Test mission aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft - the first crewed flight for that vehicle - and her third mission aboard the International Space Station. She was selected to be an astronaut in 1998, and after the Space Shuttle was retired in 2015, she was chosen to be part of the select group of astronauts who would fly on NASA's commercial crew program.\n\nBefore her flight, Ms Williams had told NDTV that she will carry a statue of Lord Ganesh with her on the commercial crew flight as \"Ganesh is her good luck charm\" and that she was more spiritual than religious and was happy to have Lord Ganesh with her in outer space. On her earlier flights, she has carried copies of the Bhagavad Gita to space. She also said she loved samosas! Among her other passions, she is also a marathon runner and ran a marathon while at the ISS.\n\nIndia has its own human spaceflight program, the Gaganyaan, and the head of ISRO's Human Space Flight Center in Bengaluru, Dr. M Mohan, told NDTV, \"Captain Sunita Williams, a veteran of space missions to the International Space Station, is embarking on another mission on the maiden flight of the Boeing Starliner craft, which makes us all proud. I wish Ms. Williams all success on another milestone journey to space.\"\n\nIndia has selected a crew of four male Gaganyatris, and if all goes well, they may fly into space from Sriharikota in the thereabouts of 2026.\n\nNASA selected SpaceX and Boeing to make new spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station, and SpaceX has been doing this since 2020. The Boeing Starliner has had many delays and is now set for the maiden crewed flight on Tuesday morning. Incidentally, Boeing has been facing many issues with its aircrafts and the company has been mired in controversy.\n\nShe will be flying alongside 61-year-old Astronaut Barry Eugene \"Butch\" Wilmore, a navy test pilot who has flown into space twice. Both veterans will be launching on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station. The astronauts will spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory before the crew capsule makes a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States of America, says NASA.\n\nInterestingly, Ms Williams was given the opportunity to name the spacecraft she would fly in, and she named it \"Calypso\" after the famous ship on which the French oceanographer and legendary filmmaker Jacques-Yves Cousteau explored the oceans when she was still a student. She also has a school named after her, the Sunita Williams Elementary School, in the town of Needham in the USA, and if all goes well, she will interact with school children from aboard the space station.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft was designed to accommodate seven passengers, or a mix of crew and cargo, for missions to low-Earth orbit. It has been in the making for more than a decade and has had many hiccups.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nSunita Williams says her days will be packed with fun activities (flying routines) as she is flying a mission to test and certify a new spacecraft. She is going to create history as she flies in the maiden mission of the new spacecraft, which has her fingerprints all over as she has been involved in its development along with Boeing and NASA engineers.

This flight and a few others will take place take under contract with Nasa, as part of a programme to transport astronauts from Earth to the International Space Station (ISS) and back.\n\nFollowing years of delays, a successful flight would provide the United States with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts to low-Earth orbit, after SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nHaving two different spacecraft available provides a back-up option if something should go wrong with one of them. So it will secure access to space for astronauts from American soil. While Starliner will be flying to the ISS for now, it could eventually make trips to future commercial space stations, like that being built by Houston-based company Axiom Space.\n\nGetting to space has never been easy, however. In the case of Starliner, that is something of an understatement. The project began back in 2010 as part of Nasa's Commercial Crew Program (CCP) when Boeing, along with SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada, was selected to develop spacecraft that could provide access to low-Earth orbit and the ISS.\n\nThe CCP design requirements were that the spacecraft had to be capable of ferrying at least four astronauts safely to and back from the ISS, to remain docked there for at least 210 days, and to provide at least 24 hours of life support in the event of an emergency return to Earth from orbit.\n\nHowever, the project has been beset with delays, including supply chain issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The original contract was intended to certify Starliner for orbital operations with astronauts in 2017. However, the first orbital flight test, without astronauts, did not occur until 20 December, 2019.\n\nStarliner will touch down on land, which removes the need for recovery ships. NASA/Bill Ingalls\n\nIt was intended to be an eight-day mission in which the spacecraft would rendezvous with the ISS and dock, before returning to Earth. During the flight, the spacecraft's onboard clock suffered a technical malfunction, which caused the rocket engines to fire - manoeuvring the craft into the wrong orbit. It failed to reach the ISS and returned to Earth after only two days.\n\nAfter lengthy investigations and technical fixes, Boeing agreed to re-run the un-crewed flight test at its own expense. Orbital Flight Test 2 launched on May 19, 2022 - two years after SpaceX's Crew Dragon had made its first successful crewed flight to the ISS. This time, Starliner's flight was successful. The spacecraft reached the ISS and docked on 21 May, 2022, where it stayed for four days, before making a safe return to Earth.\n\nIn the meantime, SpaceX has managed to launch nine flights to the ISS carrying astronauts and four commercial flights carrying a mixture of civilians and astronauts from other countries. The flight on May 6 will carry two experienced Nasa astronauts aboard. They are Sunita \"Suni\" Williams and Butch Wilmore. Both have flown on both the space shuttle and the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nNew suits\n\nThey'll wear distinctive blue flight suits which, unlike most previous designs, feature a flexible hood rather than a solid one. The lightweight materials permit the astronauts to perform delicate tasks such as using a tablet despite having gloved hands.\n\nFlight suits are designed only to be worn inside the pressurised environment of the spacecraft, not outside, and only during ascent to and return from orbit. However, they provide protection and life support to the astronauts if the capsule depressurises during these most hazardous phases of the flight.\n\nBoeing flight suits feature a zip-up hood rather than a helmet. NASA / Frank Micheaux\n\nThe combination of greater mobility, lighter weight and better dexterity, as well as a very wide field-of-view out of the hood visor, has made these suits quite popular with the astronauts who have tested them.\n\nStarliner itself is comprised of the crew capsule and a service module. The crew capsule is the part that carries people and is made of an aluminium alloy. It can accommodate up to seven astronauts, or four astronauts with up to 100kg of cargo.\n\nThe crew capsule is reusable, meaning it can be sent back into space after completing a mission, and is designed to make at least 10 flights into orbit. One innovative design feature of the spacecraft is the absence of welded sections. The crew capsule is comprised of two sections which are bolted together, rather than welded, in order to improve structural strength.\n\nThe service module houses the electrical power systems, and four Rocketdyne rocket engines. These are designed to rapidly separate the spacecraft from the Atlas V launch rocket in the event of an emergency during the ascent into space. They're also used for manoeuvring the spacecraft once it reaches orbit.\n\nOnce in orbit, Starliner is capable of making a completely automated flight to, and docking with, the ISS, without any intervention from astronauts on board. However, astronauts can still take manual control of the spacecraft if necessary. Once at ISS, Starliner is designed to remain docked at the station for up to seven months.\n\nStarliner is built in an innovative way that avoids welding pieces of metal together. NASA/ Kim Shiflett\n\nWhen it is time to return to Earth, the crew will get back in Starliner and detach from the ISS. Just prior to atmospheric entry, the service module is detached and discarded. The crew capsule then uses a combination of heat shields and parachutes to slow its speed, before touching down on land. The landing is softened for the crew by the use of airbags.\n\nThis differs from the mode of return used by Nasa's Orion spacecraft, which will be used to visit the Moon, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, both of which splash down at sea. By returning to land, Starliner removes the need to deploy specialist ships to sea in order to recover the spacecraft.\n\nDespite the delays, Starliner looks to be a very capable modern spacecraft, which should provide the US with a second means of reaching the ISS and any commercial successors for years to come. There's a lot riding on a successful performance on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_Space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axiom Space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_pressurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabin pressurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocketdyne"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/05/05m3b6fkih_th_1024x0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-20", "textStart": 1765, "textEnd": 1782}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2895, "textEnd": 2900, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 2411, "textEnd": 2417}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The astronauts then will monitor two quick thruster firings to fine-tune the ship's orbit before taking turns testing the spacecraft's computer-assisted manual control system.As with any other space station rendezvous, the Starliner will approach the lab from behind and below, looping up to a point directly ahead of the outpost and then moving in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:46 a.m. Wednesday.During final approach, ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harmony (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.7568627450980392, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Boeing's first crewed test flight will carry Williams and Butch Wilmore to the International Space Station, marking a potential triumph for the company's program. The launch is scheduled for Monday night, with the mission marking a milestone for NASA's collaboration with private firms in space exploration.\n\nIndian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams is ready to fly into space for the third time on Tuesday as the pilot aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in its the first crewed test flight.\n\nBoeing's Starliner will blast off for the International Space Station from Cape Canaveral in Florida.\n\nStarliner will carry Williams, 58, and Butch Wilmore to the International Space Station, marking what could be a momentous and long-awaited victory for the beleaguered Boeing programme.\n\nThe scheduled lift-off is set for 22:34 local time on Monday (8:04 am IST on Tuesday) ''We are all here because we are all ready. Our friends and family have heard about it and we've talked about it and they are happy and proud that we are part of the process to fix it all,'' the BBC quoted Williams as saying The mission has been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\n\nIf it is successful, it will become the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nSuch a scenario -- with both SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Starliner flying regularly -- is one for which the US space agency has long waited.\n\n\"Design and development is hard -- particularly with a human space vehicle,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner programme manager at Boeing, during a Thursday news briefing.\n\n\"There's a number of things that were surprises along the way that we had to overcome. ... It certainly made the team very, very strong. I'm very proud of how they've overcome every single issue that we've encountered and gotten us to this point,\" Nappi said.\n\n\"This is history in the making,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said of the upcoming Starliner mission during a March 22 news conference. \"We're now in the golden era of space exploration.\" SpaceX and Boeing developed their respective vehicles under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme, a partnership with private industry contractors. From the outset, the space agency aimed to have both companies operating at once. The Crew Dragon and Starliner spacecraft would each serve as a backup to the other, giving astronauts the option to keep flying, even if technical issues or other setbacks grounded one spacecraft.\n\nWilliams received her commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy from the United States Naval Academy in May 1987. Williams was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998 and is a veteran of two space missions, Expeditions 14/15 and 32/33. She served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and then commander of Expedition 33. During her first spaceflight, Expedition 14/15, Williams was launched with the crew of STS-116 on December 9, 2006, docking with the International Space Station on December 11, 2006. While onboard, she established a world record for females with four spacewalks totalling 29 hours and 17 minutes. Astronaut Peggy Whitson subsequently broke the record in 2008 with a total of five spacewalks. On Expedition 32/33, Williams was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, along with Russian Soyuz commander Yuri Malenchenko and Flight Engineer Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, on July 14, 2012. Williams spent four months conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory. She landed in Kazakhstan on November 18, 2012, after spending 127 days in space. During their Expedition, Williams and Hoshide performed three spacewalks to replace a component that relays power from the space station's solar arrays to its systems and repair an ammonia leak on a station radiator. With 50 hours and 40 minutes, Williams once again held the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut. The record has since been overtaken by Peggy Whitson. Williams has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space.\n\nWilliams was born in Euclid, Ohio, to Indian-American neuroanatomist Deepak Pandya and Slovene-American Ursuline Bonnie (Zalokar) Pandya. She holds a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy and a Master of Science in Engineering Management from Florida Institute of Technology.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse

It made another attempt in 2021 but the mission was delayed after Boeing and Nasa detected problems with the spacecraft's valves. Starliner completed a successful uncrewed mission to the ISS in 2022.\n\nBoeing delayed the first crewed launch for Starliner from 2023 to this year due to additional problems with the safety of wiring and parachutes that help to slow the spacecraft as it returns to Earth.\n\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon, meanwhile, has obtained several more flights from Nasa while Starliner remains in development. Tuesday's crewed launch is the final demonstration before the Starliner can be approved to fly routine space trips under Nasa's commercial crew programme.\n\nNasa officials have doubled their oversight of Starliner since the 2019 failure, but have expressed confidence in Boeing's experience in designing and building modules on the ISS and supporting the space station for more than two decades.\n\n\"This is a huge company with real heritage in space,\" Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University, told . \"This flight would not be going today if it weren't safe to do so.\"\n\nNasa wants to have both Starliner and Crew Dragon for its missions to ensure the US was no longer only depending upon one launch system to access the ISS, which is expected to retire around 2030 after housing astronauts for three decades.\n\nThe final years of the shuttle and subsequent dependency upon the Russian Soyuz for much of the 2010s showed the importance of having two launch systems that provide different technologies and personnel, so-called \"dissimilar redundancy\", said Professor Newman.\n\n\"In order to realise that capability, Starliner needs to show it is as low-cost and reliable as its SpaceX counterpart,\" he added.\n\n\"Crew Dragon has been a real success, Starliner has had nothing but problems. A successful launch and mission really is the bare minimum needed for Starliner to have any chance of competing alongside SpaceX.\"\n\nNasa is also looking to the commercial space industry to send astronauts to the Moon under its ambitious Artemis programme, and eventually to Mars.\n\nIn 2021, the space agency signed a $2.9bn contract with SpaceX to use its Starship mega-rocket as the lunar lander for the first Artemis astronauts. Nasa is also collaborating with billionaire Jeff Bezos's space company, Blue Origin, to develop a second lunar lander for the Artemis programme, in a $3.4bn project signed last year.\n\nBoeing's Space Launch System (SLS) is planned to be the main rocket for the Artemis programme, but it has cost Nasa more than originally planned and has faced delays.\n\nWhile Boeing is making its first step into getting a vehicle into lower Earth orbit, \"it already needs to be looking to the future, because humans are now itching to go a bit further out\", said Dr Barber.\n\nAsked for comment by , Boeing referred to its pre-launch new conference with Nasa on Friday, where an official voiced his confidence in Starliner's crewed launch.\n\n\"We go through a pretty rigorous process to get here, and really where my source of confidence comes from is going through that process,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and programme manager for CST-100 Starliner at Boeing.\n\n\"We work very closely with Nasa with everything we do, from the factory floor to the software to all of our engineering design... and we've come to the point where we are all in total agreement, you can't be more confident than that.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taz_ali@inews.co.uk", "name": "Taz Ali", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts":

It will have that new car smell -- the vehicle has never carried a human crew onboard before.\n\nThe stakes are high: For Boeing, Starliner is a chance to prove it can safely shuttle people to orbit and deflect mounting criticism of its quality control measures. For NASA, it's an opportunity to reduce its dependency on SpaceX for space missions and add a new model to the space taxi fleet.\n\nHow we got here\n\nA decade ago, NASA awarded up to $6.8 billion in contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to fill in for the retired Space Shuttle program and ferry its astronauts to the ISS. Only Elon Musk's startup understood the assignment:\n\nIn all, the Starliner program has been delayed for seven years and cost $1.5 billion more than expected.\n\nEven if Starliner dazzles in its inaugural crewed mission, the upside in the space taxi business is unclear for Boeing. The ISS is planned to be decommissioned in 2030, meaning Boeing could only make a maximum of six more missions for NASA. Plus, its 737 Max production troubles -- stemming from a door plug blowout in January -- left it with $3.9 billion in cash outflows in Q1, raising questions about its ability to fund its commercial space ambitions, Bloomberg reported.\n\nLooking ahead...NASA Administrator Bill Nelson is confident in Starship, saying, \"This is a clean spaceship, and it's ready to launch.\" Liftoff is scheduled at 10:34 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral.", "source": {"uri": "morningbrew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morning Brew"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neal_freyman@morningbrew.com", "name": "Neal Freyman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/56b219ded896f92df73377c4071aa9873592c839-1024x683.jpg?rect=0,72,1024,538&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

If successful, this mission will establish Boeing as the second private company capable of providing crew transportation to and from the ISS.\n\nThe Starliner's journey to the ISS is expected to take approximately 26 hours, during which Williams and Wilmore will conduct a series of tests to ensure the spacecraft's readiness for NASA certification under the Commercial Crew Program.\n\nOnce docked, the astronauts will spend 8 days living and working on the ISS before undocking and returning to Earth on May 15. Unlike previous US capsules that splashed down in the sea, the Starliner will make a land-based touchdown in the western United States.\n\nWilliams, a 59-year-old retired US Navy captain from Needham, Massachusetts, has an impressive background in spaceflight. She holds a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nDuring her first spaceflight, Expedition 14/15, Williams set a world record for women with four spacewalks. In total, she has spent 322 days in space across two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of EVA time on seven spacewalks. Wilmore, 61, has also logged significant time in space, with 178 days and 25 hours and 36 minutes on four spacewalks.\n\nAs part of its commitment to the ISS, Boeing has planned six manned missions for the Starliner over the next six years. NASA intends to use both SpaceX's Dragon and Boeing's Starliner to send astronauts to the ISS at least every six months from US soil.\n\nMeanwhile, India is developing its own human spaceflight program, Gaganyaan, led by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). The program aims to demonstrate human spaceflight capability by launching a crew of three members to an orbit of 400 km for a 3-day mission, with a safe return to Earth by landing in Indian sea waters. In February 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the names of the four Indian Air Force pilots who will be part of the Gaganyaan mission, slated for launch in 2024-25.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Juliet High graduate and astronaut Barry Wilmore on upcoming NASA Starliner launch", "body": "Mt. Juliet High School and Tennessee Tech University graduate Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore is scheduled to go back into space as commander of the first crewed Boeing Starliner spacecraft.\n\nWilmore will be traveling to the International Space Station on board the Starliner with fellow astronaut Suni Williams. The flight test will help NASA determine if the Starliner system is ready to fly regular crew rotation missions to space station.\n\nThe Starliner has completed two test flights without astronauts that include Orbital Flight Test 2 in 2022. The launch with Wilmore and Williams is now estimated for 9:34 p.m., Monday, according to NASA. The crew is set to dock at the space station on Wednesday.\n\nWhy NASA wants Starliner\n\nThe mission will test the automated and manual processes and capabilities of the Starliner, which NASA eventually plans to use for rotational missions with astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nSpaceX is also under contract with NASA's Commercial Crew Program and has performed crew rotation missions to the space station since 2019, using the Dragon capsule.\n\nThe NASA program contracted with Boeing to develop a second spacecraft system capable of travel to the ISS, in part to have another option if one isn't operational.\n\nThe goal when both spacecraft are certified is to rotate them regularly on space station missions as a cost-effective transportation mode that will also enhance research, according to NASA Commercial Crew Program spokesperson Steven Siceloff.\n\nSafety and flight operations\n\nWilmore: We have tweaked most every display there is. Including we have tweaked every single procedure there is. We have new procedures we didn't have at one point based on our testing and the improved capabilities of this spacecraft.\n\nIn any mode we may find ourselves in, we have survivable modes.\n\nWe don't expect any failure modes (or) significant failures, but if something were to occur because we're all humans (and) we can't build things perfectly ... we have several downgrade modes, one of which is manual, another is a backup mode ... that we can control this in any type of failure mode.\"\n\nWilliams: We made a more extensive test plan, (we) worked with them to do that on some of these areas where we made some improvements, so I think our input as testers along with the engineers who are working on these projects already were able to influence some of the design to get us to the full capability that we wanted.\n\nDepth of testing and training\n\nWilmore: Something as basic as the crew suit to seat integration -- you've actually got to get in the suit, get in the seat and make sure those kinds are correct. And we did that early on. ... We found some things that needed to be rectified. And that's just part of the process. And that's one of the exciting things about being in the role that we're in. ... You test even those kind of issues, not just all the flying, but also just the basic living and habitating within the capsule is very important.\n\nBeing named commander\n\nWilmore: I'm the one that's got the title. The first conversation we had after the assignments were made, we sat down and I said 'Suni, we're going to do this together. ...' We've known each other a long time and I respect her ability, her capability, insight, all of that. ... I have the title, but we make decisions together. ... It's almost like we're reading each other's mind at this point.\n\nFamily impact\n\nWilmore (wife Deanna and daughters Daryn and Logan): Our families have been part of this from the beginning. My wife and I met when I was already in the Navy deploying on aircraft carriers. My daughters were born after we got here. This is all they know. This is life. This is not something 'Daddy's going to space again.' Well actually it is like that ... it's just what they know. So as far as preparing them, they're prepared. We trust in a sovereign God ... whatever the plan is we're ready for it, whatever that might be. They are excited as we are and ready to go as well.\n\nWilliams (husband Michael): We wouldn't be sitting here if we didn't feel and tell our families that we feel confident in this spacecraft and our capabilities to control it and to be on it.\n\nManual control in flight operations\n\nWilmore: Operational crew capabilities is what we call them. OCCs. In that is a fair amount of manual control, manual flying, manual checkout. For instance, let's say you lose your computer. Your computer has the knowledge of where the sun is, where the stars are, where the satellites are -- the tracking satellites that allow us to bounce our communication. So if you lose your computer how do you point your antennae at the satellite? We're going to test it in this backup kind of mode. We're not going to go into backup mode, but we're going to test that capability. ... Our solar rays are basically on the back of the spacecraft. How do you point your tail at the sun if you don't have a computer? We're going to go through and we're going to test that.\"\n\nSo you want to be an astronaut?\n\nWilmore has accumulated 178 days in space over two missions. Williams has spent a total of 322 days in space over the course of her two missions.\n\nWilliams: We have people from all different fields in the astronaut office. We happen to be test pilots, but not everyone in the office is a test pilot. We have scientists, we have engineers, we have mathematicians, we have teachers in the office as well. I think everybody though has a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) background. So if you are interested in STEM, interested in exploring, interested in being a team member, that's sort of the job description.", "source": {"uri": "tennessean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tennessean"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

A NASA team in Mission Control took control of Starliner, just like during the real event, and simulated a countdown all the way to liftoff.\n\n\"This is a big weekend for NASA ... and it's not just because we're putting our friends on it on a new spaceship,\" Canadian Space Agency astronaut Josh Kutryk told Space.com in a phone interview from nearby the press center here. He is assigned to the crucial capcom (capsule communicator) position as the United Launch Alliance Atlas V spacecraft flies towards Earth orbit.\n\nRelated: Watch ULA assemble Atlas V rocket ahead of Boeing Starliner astronaut test flight (video)\n\n\"This is important strategically,\" Kutryk added, noting the approximately 10-day-long CFT aims to certify a second commercial spacecraft to bring NASA astronauts regularly to the International Space Station (ISS). \"This is the second big piece of America's overall strategy for access to low Earth orbit after implementing [SpaceX's] Dragon.\"\n\nThe mission is manifested to launch on Monday at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 GMT Tuesday, May 7) from the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, at United Launch Alliance's Pad 41.\n\nCrew Flight Test (CFT) astronaut crew Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be the first NASA astronauts and humans aboard Starliner, as well as the Atlas V rocket.\n\nOn April 26, the CFT crew -- both former U.S. Navy test pilots as well -- joined Mission Control in doing another prelaunch test in which the crew donned suits, walked out from quarantine here at the NASA Kennedy Space Center and went all the way to their launch pad at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nThe CFT astronauts won't be joining them this time, as they have other tasks to turn to ahead of ascent. But Kutryk's presence is notable: not only is he capcom during CFT's launch, but he is also one the astronauts aboard the first operational six-month spacecraft mission, Starliner-1, set to launch to the ISS no earlier than 2025.\n\nDuring Sunday's launch simulation exercise, \"We'll do a series of test items where we're basically putting power on to the Atlas V and Starliner stack on Pad 41,\" Kutryk said. \"We're looking into some of these systems, testing the comm system, for example, and just making sure we're all completely ready to go.\"\n\nAfter spending all day on console practicing on Sunday, the launching team will return to the White Flight Control Room at JSC around 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) on Monday for the big event. \"It's super exciting,\" Kutryk said of the launch. That's because NASA will be managing a launch from JSC and White Flight for the first time since the space shuttle program concluded in 2011. (SpaceX manages its own launches from an independent center in Hawthorne, California.)\n\nShortly after arriving, the team will take control of the vehicle from Boeing and go through system power-ups and fueling. Whitmore and Wilmore will make their way to the pad and get strapped in roughly three hours before launch, too.\n\n\"I'll be talking to them [the crew], talking to their personnel who are strapping them in, making sure that the complex systems are working, and also that all this simple stuff is working,\" Kutryk said. \"You'll hear us talking about, 'Can you reach this? Can you reach that? And we'll be doing pressure checks on the vehicle, pressure checks on the suits. Hundreds of pages of technical verification procedures.\"\n\nThrough launch, part of what the team will monitor is whether they need to abort at several sites in the Atlantic Ocean. Assuming all goes to plan, Starliner will be authorized to do an orbital insertion engine burn about roughly 31 minutes after launch. Kutryk said that moment will be \"really critical for the whole mission\" because it will put the astronauts in a \"sustainable, safe orbit. After that, we have a lot more options, a lot more flexibility, a lot more time to deal with anything ... that's really the job of this ascent team.\"\n\nAssuming all is going well at that point, the ascent team will then hand over their Mission Control positions to another team. Kutryk will remain on call for the rest of the mission and naturally, will begin shifting focus even more to Starliner-1 as that launch date approaches in 2021. Starliner-1 commander Mike Fincke, of NASA, is backup to the CFT astronauts and is quarantining with the CFT crew until launch. Also on Starliner-1 is NASA's Scott Tingle.\n\nKurtyk said the next Starliner mission will include a new physical capsule that is inside the Boeing building right now: \"It looks very much ready to go,\" he said. The crew has fully certified themselves for ISS operations, allowing themselves to focus on remaining Starliner-1 tasks in the coming months.\n\nStarliner's program is taking a \"build-up\" approach, to use the lingo of flight testing, that is gradually shifting from uncrewed missions to CFT and then to Starliner-1. (Starliner required two uncrewed missions after software glitches on the first attempt in 2019 stranded the spacecraft in the wrong orbit and it did not reach the ISS. But the second attempt in 2022 made it well.)\n\nAssuming CFT certifies as planned, \"that changes the calculus, it changes the discussion around a lot of risk items, around a lot of system items,\" Kurtyk said.

CFT will send NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams toward the International Space Station (ISS) at 10:34 p.m. (0234 GMT Tuesday, May 7) from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station here. You can watch it live here at Space.com, via NASA Television.\n\nBut not all the action is in Florida: Boeing and NASA are working together at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston to send this crew into space, marking the first time since the space shuttle era that a crewed spacecraft was controlled from Houston.\n\nAmong Starliner's vast support group is Teresa Kinney, the first-ever female chief engineer at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, on Florida's Space Coast. Kinney will sit as backup to Mission Control as a consultant for other engineers. While talented, some of the main controllers \"jumped in late\" compared to Kinney, she told Space.com. \"So if you had a problem that they hadn't seen, or maybe some testing they hadn't been involved in, hopefully I can provide that continuity,\" she added.\n\nRelated: I flew Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in 4 different simulators. Here's what I learned (video, photos)\n\nKinney has been working with NASA's Commercial Crew Program for years, mainly on the Starliner side; in fact, she has been on commercial crew since the days of the Constellation program. That was a Bush-era proposal from the early 2000s, later repealed, that also aimed to send astronauts to the moon and eventually Mars.\n\nKinney said her role evolved as the Commercial Crew Program did, as the hardware matured and testing continued. Contracts were first awarded in 2010, and both SpaceX and Boeing were selected in 2014 as the first commercial crew vendors to send astronauts to space.\n\n\"You never know what you don't know when you start developing hardware and doing tests and stuff,\" Kinney told Space.com at KSC. \"As I started out, we are setting up verifications and asking, 'What is this thing going to look like? How are we going to do tests and analysis?' \"\n\nModels were complicated, as multiple partners were involved, including Boeing, NASA and United Launch Alliance (which is launching CFT with its Atlas V rocket). And both SpaceX and Boeing have experienced technical issues with their programs -- involving parachute systems, for example -- that had to be addressed as their spacecraft evolved.\n\nStarliner, Kinney acknowledged, has had to deal with more issues than SpaceX's Dragon: The first Starliner flight to ISS failed to reach its destination in 2019 due to software glitches, although the follow-up uncrewed effort in 2022 got there after fixes were implemented. New issues were found in 2023 that further pushed back CFT, including with the parachutes and with flammable tape found wrapped around capsule wiring.\n\n\"The vehicle was actually a good design, but the problem is that it was a paper design,\" Kinney said. SpaceX, she pointed out, had a head start on its Crew Dragon spacecraft, as the company was already flying a cargo Dragon variant on robotic resupply missions to the ISS before launching its first crewed test flight in 2020. SpaceX has sent 11 other crews to ISS since then.\n\nBoeing, by contrast, \"literally was doing something new\" with Starliner, she said. The company was working to leverage what it knew from past programs; Boeing was the prime contractor for the ISS, for example, and also builds the core stage for NASA's Space Launch System megarocket, which successfully launched the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission toward lunar orbit in late 2022.\n\nBut new lessons had to be learned as Starliner took on its first steps in space. Kinney said the questions that arose there are similar to what she has encountered in other programs: \"You go, 'Well, what do I have to change? What should I change?' And so that was a lot of what they were doing.\"\n\nKinney cautioned that she cannot speak for everybody in Mission Control, but the folks she spoke with \"are very excited\" to see CFT get off the ground. The teams have \"scrubbed through all their systems\" to get ready for key flight review milestones ahead of liftoff, and continue to do preparations and simulations to get the astronauts safely off the ground.\n\n\"I love it when you work with a team that is so focused on the right things,\" Kinney said. \"There's no shrinking violets in the group as far as safety and stuff. So I think it's going to be as good as we can can make it.\"", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constellation program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XPGoMsJA6UJJxZPkmtzV9-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 100, "textEnd": 105}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 455, "textEnd": 460}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

A NASA team in Mission Control took control of Starliner, just like during the real event, and simulated a countdown all the way to liftoff. \"This is a big weekend for NASA ... and it's not just because we're putting our friends on it on a new spaceship,\"\n\nRelated: Watch ULA assemble Atlas V rocket ahead of Boeing Starliner astronaut test flight (video)\n\n\"This is important strategically,\" Kutryk added, noting the approximately 10-day-long CFT aims to certify a second commercial spacecraft to bring NASA astronauts regularly to the International Space Station (ISS). \"This is the second big piece of America's overall strategy for access to low Earth orbit after implementing [SpaceX's] Dragon.\"\n\nThe mission is manifested to launch on Monday at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 GMT Tuesday, May 7) from the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, at United Launch Alliance's Pad 41.\n\nCrew Flight Test (CFT) astronaut crew Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be the first NASA astronauts and humans aboard Starliner, as well as the Atlas V rocket.\n\nOn April 26, the CFT crew -- both former U.S. Navy test pilots as well -- joined Mission Control in doing another prelaunch test in which the crew donned suits, walked out from quarantine here at the NASA Kennedy Space Center and went all the way to their launch pad at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nThe CFT astronauts won't be joining them this time, as they have other tasks to turn to ahead of ascent. But Kutryk's presence is notable: not only is he capcom during CFT's launch, but he is also one the astronauts aboard the first operational six-month spacecraft mission, Starliner-1, set to launch to the ISS no earlier than 2025.\n\nDuring Sunday's launch simulation exercise, \"We'll do a series of test items where we're basically putting power on to the Atlas V and Starliner stack on Pad 41,\" Kutryk said. \"We're looking into some of these systems, testing the comm system, for example, and just making sure we're all completely ready to go.\"\n\nAfter spending all day on console practicing on Sunday, the launching team will return to the White Flight Control Room at JSC around 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) on Monday for the big event. \"It's super exciting,\" Kutryk said of the launch. That's because NASA will be managing a launch from JSC and White Flight for the first time since the space shuttle program concluded in 2011. (SpaceX manages its own launches from an independent center in Hawthorne, California.)\n\nShortly after arriving, the team will take control of the vehicle from Boeing and go through system power-ups and fueling. Whitmore and Wilmore will make their way to the pad and get strapped in roughly three hours before launch, too.\n\n\"I'll be talking to them [the crew], talking to their personnel who are strapping them in, making sure that the complex systems are working, and also that all this simple stuff is working,\" Kutryk said. \"You'll hear us talking about, 'Can you reach this? Can you reach that? And we'll be doing pressure checks on the vehicle, pressure checks on the suits. Hundreds of pages of technical verification procedures.\"\n\nThrough launch, part of what the team will monitor is whether they need to abort at several sites in the Atlantic Ocean. Assuming all goes to plan, Starliner will be authorized to do an orbital insertion engine burn about roughly 31 minutes after launch. Kutryk said that moment will be \"really critical for the whole mission\" because it will put the astronauts in a \"sustainable, safe orbit. After that, we have a lot more options, a lot more flexibility, a lot more time to deal with anything ... that's really the job of this ascent team.\"\n\nAssuming all is going well at that point, the ascent team will then hand over their Mission Control positions to another team. Kutryk will remain on call for the rest of the mission and naturally, will begin shifting focus even more to Starliner-1 as that launch date approaches in 2021. Starliner-1 commander Mike Fincke, of NASA, is backup to the CFT astronauts and is quarantining with the CFT crew until launch. Also on Starliner-1 is NASA's Scott Tingle.\n\nKurtyk said the next Starliner mission will include a new physical capsule that is inside the Boeing building right now: \"It looks very much ready to go,\" he said. The crew has fully certified themselves for ISS operations, allowing themselves to focus on remaining Starliner-1 tasks in the coming months.\n\nStarliner's program is taking a \"build-up\" approach, to use the lingo of flight testing, that is gradually shifting from uncrewed missions to CFT and then to Starliner-1. (Starliner required two uncrewed missions after software glitches on the first attempt in 2019 stranded the spacecraft in the wrong orbit and it did not reach the ISS. But the second attempt in 2022 made it well.)\n\nAssuming CFT certifies as planned, \"that changes the calculus, it changes the discussion around a lot of risk items, around a lot of system items,\" Kurtyk said. Redesigned software is coming that allows future crews to dock at more ports than a single one at the ISS Harmony module, which is the case right now. The crew will also want to ensure that Starliner can power down for months at the ISS, instead of the few days CFT requires.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Our friends and family have heard about it and we've talked about it and they are happy and proud that we are part of the process to fix it all,\" the BBC quoted Williams as saying\n\nThe mission has been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\n\nIf it is successful, it will become the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nSuch a scenario -- with both SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Starliner flying regularly -- is one for which the US space agency has long waited.\n\n\"Design and development is hard -- particularly with a human space vehicle,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner programme manager at Boeing, during a Thursday news briefing.\n\n\"There's a number of things that were surprises along the way that we had to overcome. ... It certainly made the team very, very strong. I'm very proud of how they've overcome every single issue that we've encountered and gotten us to this point,\" Nappi said.\n\n\"This is history in the making,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said of the upcoming Starliner mission during a March 22 news conference. \"We're now in the golden era of space exploration.\"\n\nSpaceX and Boeing developed their respective vehicles under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme, a partnership with private industry contractors. From the outset, the space agency aimed to have both companies operating at once. The Crew Dragon and Starliner spacecraft would each serve as a backup to the other, giving astronauts the option to keep flying, even if technical issues or other setbacks grounded one spacecraft.\n\nWilliams received her commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy from the United States Naval Academy in May 1987.\n\nWilliams was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998 and is a veteran of two space missions, Expeditions 14/15 and 32/33.\n\nShe served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and then commander of Expedition 33.\n\nDuring her first spaceflight, Expedition 14/15, Williams was launched with the crew of STS-116 December 9, 2006, docking with the International Space Station December 11, 2006.\n\nWhile onboard, she established a world record for females with four spacewalks totalling 29 hours and 17 minutes. Astronaut Peggy Whitson subsequently broke the record in 2008 with a total of five spacewalks.\n\nOn Expedition 32/33, Williams was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, along with Russian Soyuz commander Yuri Malenchenko and Flight Engineer Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, July 14, 2012.\n\nWilliams spent four months conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nShe landed in Kazakhstan November 18, 2012, after spending 127 days in space.\n\nDuring their Expedition, Williams and Hoshide performed three spacewalks to replace a component that relays power from the space station's solar arrays to its systems and repair an ammonia leak on a station radiator. With 50 hours and 40 minutes, Williams once again held the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut. The record has since been overtaken by Peggy Whitson. Williams has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space.\n\nWilliams was born in Euclid, Ohio, to Indian-American neuroanatomist Deepak Pandya and Slovene-American Ursuline Bonnie (Zalokar) Pandya.\n\nShe holds a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy and a Master of Science in Engineering Management from Florida Institute of Technology.", "source": {"uri": "orissapost.com",

They're up for it,\" Williams told reporters after arriving in Florida near the launch site on April 25.\n\nBut there will be other events to take in, both in the leadup to launch and in its aftermath. Here's a guide to the upcoming webcasts that will highlight the Starliner mission, which is known as Crew Flight Test (CFT). You'll be able to watch all of them here at Space.com, courtesy of NASA.\n\nThe action started on Wednesday (May 1) at 1:30 p.m. EDT (1730 GMT), when NASA held a press conference with Wilmore and Williams at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, which is next door to CFT's launch site, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\n\"It almost feels unreal,\" Williams, who will serve as the mission pilot, said during the livestreamed event, which was conducted remotely while the astronauts were under quarantine ahead of their impending mission. \"I don't think either one of us ever dreamed that we'd be associated with the first flight of a brand-new spacecraft.\"\n\nNASA officials and Starliner program leadership held a preflight press conference at KSC on Friday (May 3) to announce that all team members polled 'go' for launch on May 6.\n\nDuring opening remarks, NASA administrator Bill Nelson stressed the historical importance of a spacecraft's first crew test flight. \"The first time humans have flown on a new spacecraft started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then Dragon and now Starliner,\" Nelson said.\n\n\"Oh by the way, one other historical fact is this is the first time since the Apollo 7 launch that a human astronaut launch is actually on what used to be the Air Force's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and now is of course, Cape Canaveral Space Force station,\" Nelson added.\n\nLaunch day! CFT is scheduled to lift off on Monday at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 GMT on May 7), but the livestream action starts far earlier -- at 6:30 p.m. EDT (2230 GMT).\n\nThe NASA livestream coverage will continue long past launch, all the way through Starliner's docking with the ISS and beyond.\n\nThe following events are of particular interest (but note that the given times are tentative and could change):\n\nA post-launch press conference is expected to start on Tuesday (May 7) at midnight EDT (0400 GMT), with the following participants:\n\nKen Bowersox, associate administrator, NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate\n\nSteve Stich, manager, NASA's Commercial Crew Program\n\nDana Weigel, manager, NASA's International Space Station Program\n\nMark Nappi, vice president and program manager, Commercial Crew Program, Boeing\n\nGary Wentz, vice president, Government and Commercial Programs, ULA\n\nMay 8 is CFT docking day.

Our friends and family have heard about it and we've talked about it and they are happy and proud that we are part of the process to fix it all,\" the BBC quoted Williams as saying The mission has been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\n\nIf it is successful, it will become the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nSuch a scenario -- with both SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Starliner flying regularly -- is one for which the US space agency has long waited.\n\n\"Design and development is hard -- particularly with a human space vehicle,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner programme manager at Boeing, during a Thursday news briefing.\n\n\"There's a number of things that were surprises along the way that we had to overcome. ... It certainly made the team very, very strong. I'm very proud of how they've overcome every single issue that we've encountered and gotten us to this point,\" Nappi said.\n\n\"This is history in the making,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said of the upcoming Starliner mission during a March 22 news conference. \"We're now in the golden era of space exploration.\" SpaceX and Boeing developed their respective vehicles under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme, a partnership with private industry contractors. From the outset, the space agency aimed to have both companies operating at once. The Crew Dragon and Starliner spacecraft would each serve as a backup to the other, giving astronauts the option to keep flying, even if technical issues or other setbacks grounded one spacecraft.\n\nWilliams received her commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy from the United States Naval Academy in May 1987.\n\nWilliams was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998 and is a veteran of two space missions, Expeditions 14/15 and 32/33.\n\nShe served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and then commander of Expedition 33.\n\nDuring her first spaceflight, Expedition 14/15, Williams was launched with the crew of STS-116 on December 9, 2006, docking with the International Space Station on December 11, 2006. While onboard, she established a world record for females with four spacewalks totalling 29 hours and 17 minutes. Astronaut Peggy Whitson subsequently broke the record in 2008 with a total of five spacewalks.\n\nOn Expedition 32/33, Williams was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, along with Russian Soyuz commander Yuri Malenchenko and Flight Engineer Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, on July 14, 2012.\n\nWilliams spent four months conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nShe landed in Kazakhstan on November 18, 2012, after spending 127 days in space.\n\nDuring their Expedition, Williams and Hoshide performed three spacewalks to replace a component that relays power from the space station's solar arrays to its systems and repair an ammonia leak on a station radiator. With 50 hours and 40 minutes, Williams once again held the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut. The record has since been overtaken by Peggy Whitson. Williams has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space.\n\nWilliams was born in Euclid, Ohio, to Indian-American neuroanatomist Deepak Pandya and Slovene-American Ursuline Bonnie (Zalokar) Pandya.\n\nShe holds a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy and a Master of Science in Engineering Management from Florida Institute of Technology.

Our friends and family have heard about it and we've talked about it and they are happy and proud that we are part of the process to fix it all,\" the BBC quoted Williams as saying The mission has been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\n\nIf it is successful, it will become the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nSuch a scenario -- with both SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Starliner flying regularly -- is one for which the US space agency has long waited.\n\nAlso read: KPP Nambiar Award conferred on ISRO Chairman S Somanath\n\n\"Design and development is hard -- particularly with a human space vehicle,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner programme manager at Boeing, during a Thursday news briefing.\n\n\"There's a number of things that were surprises along the way that we had to overcome. ... It certainly made the team very, very strong. I'm very proud of how they've overcome every single issue that we've encountered and gotten us to this point,\" Nappi said.\n\n\"This is history in the making,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said of the upcoming Starliner mission during a March 22 news conference.\n\n\"We're now in the golden era of space exploration.\" SpaceX and Boeing developed their respective vehicles under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme, a partnership with private industry contractors. From the outset, the space agency aimed to have both companies operating at once. The Crew Dragon and Starliner spacecraft would each serve as a backup to the other, giving astronauts the option to keep flying, even if technical issues or other setbacks grounded one spacecraft.\n\nWilliams received her commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy from the United States Naval Academy in May 1987.\n\nWilliams was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998 and is a veteran of two space missions, Expeditions 14/15 and 32/33.\n\nShe served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and then commander of Expedition 33.\n\nDuring her first spaceflight, Expedition 14/15, Williams was launched with the crew of STS-116 on December 9, 2006, docking with the International Space Station on December 11, 2006.\n\nWhile onboard, she established a world record for females with four spacewalks totalling 29 hours and 17 minutes. Astronaut Peggy Whitson subsequently broke the record in 2008 with a total of five spacewalks.\n\nOn Expedition 32/33, Williams was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, along with Russian Soyuz commander Yuri Malenchenko and Flight Engineer Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, on July 14, 2012.\n\nWilliams spent four months conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nAlso read: India planning to launch 50 satellites for intelligence gathering in five years: ISRO chief\n\nShe landed in Kazakhstan on November 18, 2012, after spending 127 days in space.\n\nDuring their Expedition, Williams and Hoshide performed three spacewalks to replace a component that relays power from the space station's solar arrays to its systems and repair an ammonia leak on a station radiator. With 50 hours and 40 minutes, Williams once again held the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut. The record has since been overtaken by Peggy Whitson. Williams has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space.\n\nWilliams was born in Euclid, Ohio, to Indian-American neuroanatomist Deepak Pandya and Slovene-American Ursuline Bonnie (Zalokar) Pandya.\n\nShe holds a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy and a Master of Science in Engineering Management from Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nSHARE Copy

Officials said they were working no issues with the spacecraft, and forecasts called for a 95% chance of acceptable launch weather.\n\nThe CFT mission is intended to be the final test flight for Starliner before NASA certifies it for use on crew rotation missions to the ISS. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will put the spacecraft through its paces on the mission, slated to last a little more than a week.\n\n\"It's exciting to bring in Starliner and the ULA Atlas 5,\" Steve Stich, NASA commercial crew program manager, said at the briefing. \"We've been striving for commercial crew to have two independent space transportation systems. That's been our goal from commercial crew's inception and we're very close to reaching that goal.\"\n\nA successful CFT mission would allow NASA to certify the vehicle in time for an early 2025 launch of the first operational Starliner mission, designated Starliner-1. NASA has already announced three of the crew members for that flight: NASA astronauts Scott Tingle and Mike Fincke and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Joshua Kutryk.\n\nThe fourth person to fly on that mission has not yet been assigned. \"The final crew assignment for Starliner-1 will be announced following review and approval by the agency and its international partners,\" NASA said in November when it announced the addition of Kutryk to the crew.\n\nSince the Crew-5 mission in the fall of 2022, one seat on commercial crew missions has been assigned to a Russian cosmonaut, part of a seat barter agreement finalized in July 2022 between NASA and Roscosmos. In exchange, a NASA astronaut gets a seat on Soyuz flights to the station, an approach NASA calls \"integrated crews\" that ensures there will be at least one American and one Russian on the ISS should either Soyuz or commercial crew vehicles suffer problems that ground them.\n\nAt the May 3 briefing, though, NASA officials said it was unlikely that a Russian cosmonaut would be assigned to Starliner-1. \"We expect, on the Roscosmos side, they're more likely to want to see a long-duration flight also, so we think they'll want to start to fly with us on Starliner-2,\" said Dana Weigel, NASA ISS program manager.\n\nThat would appear to disrupt the ongoing series of seat exchanges between NASA and Roscosmos. \"We're still working through that with our Roscosmos counterparts. It's our desire to continue to do integrated crew,\" she said, adding that NASA and Roscosmos don't have an agreement yet in place for exchanging crews in the timeframe that will include Starliner-1.\n\nAny lapse in integrated crews, she added, would be temporary. \"The expectation is, even if we can't make that swap work, we'll go back to the integrated crew and swapping for all of the rest of the flights.\"\n\nOnce Starliner is certified, NASA plans to alternate between that vehicle and Crew Dragon for ISS crew rotation missions. Boeing is under contract for six operational missions, which under that alternating flight approach would run through 2030, the scheduled retirement of the station.", "source": {"uri": "spacenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_foust@spacenews.com", "name": "Jeff Foust", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roscosmos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Crew-5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Crew-5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kutryk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Kutryk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Space_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Space Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_D._Tingle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott D.

They oversaw the construction of the International Space Station. Now, with the shuttle's retirement, these princely figures in the human spaceflight community were tasked with selecting a replacement vehicle to send astronauts to the orbiting laboratory.\n\nBoeing was the easy favorite. The majority of engineers and other participants in the meeting argued that Boeing alone should win a contract worth billions of dollars to develop a crew capsule. Only toward the end did a few voices speak up in favor of a second contender, SpaceX. At the meeting's conclusion, NASA's chief of human spaceflight at the time, William Gerstenmaier, decided to hold off on making a final decision.\n\nA few months later, NASA publicly announced its choice. Boeing would receive $4.2 billion to develop a \"commercial crew\" transportation system, and SpaceX would get $2.6 billion. It was not a total victory for Boeing, which had lobbied hard to win all of the funding. But the company still walked away with nearly two-thirds of the money and the widespread presumption that it would easily beat SpaceX to the space station.\n\nThe sense of triumph would prove to be fleeting. Boeing decisively lost the commercial crew space race, and it proved to be a very costly affair.\n\nWith Boeing's Starliner spacecraft finally due to take flight this week with astronauts on board, we know the extent of the loss, both in time and money. Dragon first carried people to the space station nearly four years ago. In that span, the Crew Dragon vehicle has flown thirteen public and private missions to orbit. Because of this success, Dragon will end up flying 14 operational missions to the station for NASA, earning a tidy fee each time, compared to just six for Starliner. Through last year, Boeing has taken $1.5 billion in charges due to delays and overruns with its spacecraft development.\n\nSo what happened? How did Boeing, the gold standard in human spaceflight for decades, fall so far behind on crew? This story, based largely on interviews with unnamed current and former employees of Boeing and contractors who worked on Starliner, attempts to provide some answers.\n\nThe early days\n\nWhen the contracts were awarded, SpaceX had the benefit of working with NASA to develop a cargo variant of Dragon, which by 2014 was flying regular missions to the space station. But the company had no experience with human spaceflight. Boeing, by contrast, had decades of spaceflight experience, but it had to start from scratch with Starliner.\n\nEach faced a deeper cultural challenge. A decade ago, SpaceX was deep into several major projects, including developing a new version of the Falcon 9 rocket, flying more frequently, experimenting with landing and reuse, and doing cargo supply missions. This new contract meant more money but a lot more work. A NASA engineer who worked closely with both SpaceX and Boeing in this time frame recalls visiting SpaceX and the atmosphere being something like a frenzied graduate school, where all of the employees were being pulled in different directions. Getting engineers to focus on Crew Dragon was difficult.\n\nBut at least SpaceX was in its natural environment. Boeing's space division had never won a large fixed-price contract. Its leaders were used to operating in a cost-plus environment, in which Boeing could bill the government for all of its expenses and earn a fee. Cost overruns and delays were not the company's problem -- they were NASA's. Now Boeing had to deliver a flyable spacecraft for a firm, fixed price.\n\nBoeing struggled to adjust to this environment. When it came to complicated space projects, Boeing was used to spending other people's money. Now, every penny spent on Starliner meant one less penny in profit (or, ultimately, greater losses). This meant that Boeing allocated fewer resources to Starliner than it needed to thrive.\n\n\"The difference between the two company's cultures, design philosophies, and decision-making structures allowed SpaceX to excel in a fixed-price environment, where Boeing stumbled, even after receiving significantly more funding,\" said Lori Garver in an interview. She was deputy administrator of NASA from 2009 to 2013 during the formative years of the commercial crew program and is the author of Escaping Gravity.\n\nSo Boeing faced financial pressure from the beginning. At the same time, it was confronting major technical challenges. Building a human spacecraft is very difficult. Some of the biggest hurdles would be flight software and propulsion.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_berger@arstechnica.com", "name": "Eric Berger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Gerstenmaier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William H.

Its airline business is under pressure because of a series of accidents. And the firm's space sector is also under scrutiny following difficulties in developing Starliner itself.\n\n\"It's a really big day for Boeing\", commented Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University.\n\n\"The company has been working on the spacecraft for so long, they have had a few problems with the test flights and there's a lot riding on this\".\n\ntarliner was originally due to have its first uncrewed test flight in 2015 but this was delayed until 2019. When it did occur, software glitches led to an internal clock malfunction, resulting in thrusters over-firing. So much fuel was consumed that the capsule couldn't reach the space station.\n\nA second attempt was planned in August 2021 but delayed again until May 2022. An issue with the propulsion system was blamed. When Starliner did finally get off Earth, it managed to complete its full mission but concerns were then later raised about the performance of some thrusters and the craft's cooling system.\n\nCorrecting these faults and additional issues to do with the safety of wiring and parachutes pushed the first crewed demonstration back to where we are today.\n\nNasa and Boeing would not have given the go ahead for astronauts to fly the mission unless they were certain all the glitches had been sorted out. And the launch will be aborted if there is any sign of problems with the spacecraft.\n\nAt a pre-flight news conference, a reporter put it to the Navy-trained astronauts that the setbacks must make their flight \"scary\" for friends and family.\n\nBarry \"Butch\" Wilmore said it would be wrong to describe the various technical issues as \"setbacks\".\n\n\"We'd call them steps forward. We find an issue and rectify that and we have articulated that to our families so that they understand that,\" he added.\n\nAnd Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, who will pilot the spacecraft, commented: \"We are all here because we are all ready.

Williams retired from the US Navy and has a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy and a master's degree from Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nMission plan\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are scheduled to spend 8 days on the ISS and will return to Earth on May 15. During their time on ISS, the astronauts are expected to carry out several tests. The aircraft will make a land-based touchdown, instead of splashing down in the sea, according to a report by Times of India.\n\nBoeing's test\n\nThe mission will take approximately 26 hours to take Williams and Wilmore to ISS, during which the two astronauts will conduct tests to check the preparedness of the spacecraft under the new commercial program for certification, the report said. The successful completion of the mission will make the US aircraft maker the second private firm that can provide crew transportation to and from ISS, the report added. Boeing has 6 planned missions over the next six years and the US space agency intends to use Starliner as well as SpaceX's Dragon for transportation purposes, the TOI report further said.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Pandya", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepak Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Whitson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peggy Whitson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehsana_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mehsana district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mehsana district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Naval Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/05/20240506132142_Sunita.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 194, "textEnd": 199, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1593, "textEnd": 1599}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 674, "textEnd": 686}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

We wouldn't say we're ready if we weren't ready,\" said Williams.\n\nThis mission marks the inaugural crewed test flight of the Starliner, a crucial step in advancing human space exploration. Departing from the storied launchpad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, Williams, along with fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore, will voyage to the International Space Station (ISS), symbolizing a potential triumph for Boeing's ambitious spacefaring endeavors.\n\nBoeing's Starliner program has weathered setbacks and delays, navigating the treacherous terrain of spacecraft development.\n\nIn the words of Mark Nappi, Boeing's vice president and Starliner program manager, \"Design and development is hard -- particularly with a human space vehicle.\" Indeed, the journey to this momentous occasion has been fraught with unexpected hurdles, each demanding innovative solutions and unwavering resolve.\n\nYet, despite the obstacles encountered along the way, the team has emerged stronger, fortified by their collective resilience and unwavering commitment to excellence.\n\nFor NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, this mission represents more than just a technological achievement; it signifies the dawn of a new era in space exploration.\n\nWith both SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner poised to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS, NASA stands on the precipice of a historic milestone -- one that promises to redefine humanity's relationship with the cosmos.\n\n\"This is history in the making,\" proclaims Nelson during a March 22 news conference, capturing the profound significance of this moment. Indeed, the convergence of technological prowess and human ingenuity has opened a gateway to the stars, offering tantalizing glimpses of the possibilities that lie beyond.\n\nFor Williams, a veteran astronaut with an illustrious career spanning decades, this mission represents the culmination of a lifelong dream. Selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998, Williams has distinguished herself through her exceptional courage and unwavering dedication to exploration.\n\nWith two previous space missions under her belt -- Expeditions 14/15 and 32/33 -- Williams has already etched her name into the annals of space history.\n\nDuring her first spaceflight, Expedition 14/15, Williams shattered records, conducting four spacewalks totaling 29 hours and 17 minutes -- the most ever by a female astronaut at the time. Subsequently, on Expedition 32/33, Williams continued to push the boundaries of human achievement, spending four months aboard the ISS conducting groundbreaking research and exploration.\n\nIn the words of Williams herself, \"We are all here because we are all ready.\" Ready to embark on a journey that transcends the confines of Earth, ready to explore the mysteries of the cosmos, and ready to usher in a new era of space exploration -- one defined by collaboration, innovation, and the boundless potential of the human spirit.", "source": {"uri": "gg2.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, various funding shortages (which delayed both companies) and technical delays on the first uncrewed flight test and before the second one, means SpaceX has already flown nine crewed flights to the ISS for NASA.\n\nBoeing is so far delayed that it has even missed out on any extra missions within the ISS's lifespan, all of those going to SpaceX. However, details on the decommissioning of the ISS after 2030 have yet to be finalized so in theory there could be more flights given to Boeing but that is still unknown.\n\nHowever, only a few nations have mastered the ability to fly humans into space. Nations, not companies, so the fact that two US companies will hopefully soon be capable of human spaceflight is still impressive and should be celebrated.\n\nWith Boeing most likely taking all the headlines, SpaceX is pushing for a possible four launch week.\n\nOnce again, SpaceX will launch a Starlink mission from each of its Falcon 9 launch sites, the first should have already launched by this post's publication. It's really had to continue the discussion on Starlinks as it has all been said before. It's big, and really important to the longevity of SpaceX's Starship and Martian development programs, so there will be a lot of them.\n\nAt this point it's more newsworthy that SpaceX doesn't launch in a week or launches something other than Starlink.", "source": {"uri": "spaceexplored.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space Explored"}, "authors": [{"uri": "seth_kurkowski@spaceexplored.com", "name": "Seth Kurkowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/spaceexplored.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/GM6VCUDXgAEUPzy.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

This history-making launch is scheduled for May 7th, 2024, at 8:04 am IST, blasting off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, US.\n\nBut here's what makes this mission particularly exciting: beloved Indian origin astronaut , 59, will be piloting the spacecraft on its first-ever crewed mission to the ().\n\nWhile a veteran of two space missions with a total of 322 days spent orbiting Earth, there's a certain thrill to the unknown. Williams acknowledges some nerves, but her enthusiasm for exploration remains undimmed. \"When I reach the ISS,\" she says, \"it will be like going back home.\"\n\nHowever, Sunita Williams won't be alone on this adventure. Joining her is veteran Butch Wilmore, a 61-year-old Navy test pilot with two space missions under his belt as well. Together, they'll soar aboard a Atlas V rocket for a critical, 26-hour journey.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will be tasked with conducting a series of tests to ensure the Starliner meets 's stringent safety standards for future regular missions. After docking, the astronauts will spend a productive eight days living and working on the ISS before returning to Earth on May 15. Unlike traditional US capsules that splashdown in the ocean, the Starliner will make a novel land-based touchdown in the western US.\n\nWith this mission, Williams is poised to etch her name in the history books -- becoming the first woman to pilot a maiden crewed mission on a brand-new spacecraft. No stranger to pushing boundaries, she previously held the record for longest cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut (a record since surpassed by Peggy Whitson). In fact, she even completed the Boston Marathon after running in one place for over four hours while aboard the ISS.\n\nAlso a decorated Navy test pilot with a passion for science, Williams was selected for the astronaut program in 1998. After the Space Shuttle's retirement, she transitioned seamlessly into the next generation of space travel, chosen for NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nThis program, a collaboration with private companies like Boeing, aims to revitalise American spaceflight. The Starliner mission, alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, signifies a new era of public-private partnership in space exploration.\n\nAdding a touch of personal tradition, Williams will carry a statuette of Lord Ganesh, her \"good luck charm,\" on this historic flight.\n\nBack on Earth, her achievements resonate across the globe, particularly in India where she holds immense national pride. Dr M Mohan, head of ISRO's Human Space Flight Center, expressed his admiration for Williams, stating, \"We are all proud\" of her upcoming mission. India itself has its sights set on the stars with their Gaganyaan program, aiming for a crewed mission by 2026.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maiden flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaganyaan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaganyaan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_retirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle retirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Whitson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peggy Whitson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Space_Research_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Space Research Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/109885959/remember-sunita-williams-indian-origin-astronaut-who-made-history-by-going-to-space-twice-she-is-all-set-to-fly-to-space-for-the-third-time.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1283, "textEnd": 1289}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Liftoff is scheduled for 7:34 PM PT / 10:34 PM ET--the moment Earth's rotation will position the launchpad into alignment with the International Space Station's (ISS) orbit. But before Boeing's crew hits the launch pad, they'll be experiencing one of Earth's favorite pastimes: Watching movies. Specifically, watching Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nWhile astronauts traveling to the ISS va SpaceX's Dragon capsule typically reach the launchpad while riding in a Tesla, Boeing's crew will get there via a \"more traditional astrovan\" equipped with a video screen that will play Top Gun: Maverick. It's likely that the highly rated film was chosen by the crew themselves.\n\nIf successful, this launch will carry mission commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams on a test-drive of the Starliner capsule--its first piloted flight. Both Williams and Wilmore are former Navy test pilots and experienced astronauts, with a combined four spaceflights, 11 spacewalks, and 500 days spent in orbit between them, along with trips to space via the now-defunct Space Shuttle Program and Russia's Soyuz, a sort of space-taxi that functioned as the main mode of transport to the ISS before the introduction of SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which flew its first crewed flight in May 2020. If all goes as planned, the Starliner--likely named after Boeing's luxury 787 Dreamliner aircraft--will join the Soyuz and Dragon as a new way to taxi astronauts to and from the ISS. Unlike SpaceX's Dragon, which splashes into the sea upon returning to Earth, the Starliner uses special airbags to cushion the blow as the craft lands on the ground.\n\nAssuming all goes well, and the launch isn't delayed again due to weather or technical issues, this trip to the stars will be a historic moment for Boeing. But it comes at a moment where the company itself is under a high amount of scrutiny from both safety officials and the public after a door plug on one of Boeing's 737 MAX 9 planes became dislodged mid-takeoff while the plane was 15,000 feet off the ground, requiring Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 to make an emergency landing on January 5. No one was injured, but 737 MAX 9's around the world were grounded for inspection.\n\nEven worse, two Boeing whistleblowers have died under questionable circumstances over the last two months. The first, 62-year-old John Barnett, who worked for Boeing for 32 years, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head on March 9, with his death ruled a suicide. Then, on April 30th, 45-year-old Joshua Dean--a former quality auditor at Spirit AeroSystems, where Boeing's fuselage sections are assembled--died from a mysterious infection that progressed rapidly. At least 10 more whistleblowers are set to testify in front of the Senate regarding issues with Boeing's workplace safety culture.", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "claire_lewis@gamespot.com", "name": "Claire Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun:_Maverick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Top Gun: Maverick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4298736-maverick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 2311, "textEnd": 2320}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-09", "textStart": 2635, "textEnd": 2642}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 1467, "textEnd": 1475}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Image Credit: NASA\n\nIndian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams, a trailblazer in space exploration, is set to make history once again as she embarks on a journey back to the International Space Station (ISS) in her third trip to space. While this is already an impressive feat, Williams will be making this trip at the age of 58, making her one of the oldest astronauts to go to space.\n\nWilliams, who achieved great fame for her previous space missions and spacewalks including a stint aboard the ISS, will become one of the oldest astronauts to venture into space, with her upcoming mission.\n\nScheduled for liftoff from the Kennedy Space Center on May 7, 2024, at 8:04 am (IST), Williams will serve as the mission pilot aboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft.\n\nThis mission marks her return to space after several years, with Williams last visiting the ISS at the age of 58. With a remarkable career spanning over two decades, Williams has accumulated an impressive record of 322 days spent in space, according to official figures from NASA.\n\nNotably, she formerly held the record for the most extended spacewalk time by a female astronaut, logging 50 hours and 40 minutes across seven spacewalks.\n\nAccompanying Williams on this significant journey is fellow astronaut Barry Willmore, a seasoned navy test pilot with prior spaceflight experience.\n\nThe duo will embark on a week-long mission to the ISS, aimed at testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nWhile speaking to NDTV, Williams expressed a mix of excitement and nervousness about the upcoming flight, and said that her arrival at the ISS is similar to \"going back home.\"\n\nLaunching atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, Williams and Willmore will travel to the ISS, where they will conduct various experiments and tests to evaluate the spacecraft's capabilities, and will be staying for over a week.\n\nFollowing their stay aboard the ISS, the astronauts will make a return journey to Earth by parachuting to the southwest of the United States.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft, named 'Calypso' by Williams in homage to Jacques-Yves Cousteau's iconic ship, is designed to accommodate up to seven passengers or a combination of crew and cargo for low-Earth orbit missions, according to Boeing.\n\nWilliams' selection of the name reflects her admiration for Cousteau's contributions to ocean exploration and conservation.\n\nAs Williams and Willmore prepare to embark on this historic mission, their journey symbolizes the enduring spirit of exploration and collaboration in humanity's quest for knowledge beyond the confines of Earth.",

The launch is set for May 7, 2024, at 8.34 8.04 a.m. India time, from the Kennedy Space Centre.\n\nShe admits she is scared, but she is not concerned about flying in a new spaceship. While practicing on the launch pad, Williams stated, \"When I reach the International Space Station, it will be like coming home.\"\n\nThe 59-year-old, born to Dr. Deepak Pandya and Bonnie Pandya, will make history as the first woman to travel on the inaugural flight of a new human-rated spaceship. A certified military test pilot, she has gone to space twice, in 2006 and 2012, and according to NASA records, \"Sunita has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space.\"\n\nShe previously held the record for the longest spacewalk duration by a female astronaut, having spent 50 hours and 40 minutes on seven spacewalks.

NASA chose two companies to bring us back to the International Space Station, providing them with funding to build a crewed space vehicle: One established, long-proven aerospace engineering firm, and one upstart run by a guy who names all his kids like they're Warhammer figures. Ten years later, the race has a clear loser: Boeing.\n\nBoeing received $4.2 billion in federal funding to build its Starliner system, far more than the $2.6 billion allowance SpaceX got for its Dragon. It's far and away the more established competitor, with over a century of aeronautics experience, yet Starliner is only now preparing for its first crewed flight -- four years after Dragon's, and $1.5 billion over budget. Ars Technica looked into what went wrong:\n\nBut at least SpaceX was in its natural environment. Boeing's space division had never won a large fixed-price contract. Its leaders were used to operating in a cost-plus environment, in which Boeing could bill the government for all of its expenses and earn a fee. Cost overruns and delays were not the company's problem -- they were NASA's. Now Boeing had to deliver a flyable spacecraft for a firm, fixed price.\n\nBoeing struggled to adjust to this environment. When it came to complicated space projects, Boeing was used to spending other people's money. Now, every penny spent on Starliner meant one less penny in profit (or, ultimately, greater losses). This meant that Boeing allocated fewer resources to Starliner than it needed to thrive.\n\n...\n\nIn a fixed-price contract, a company gets paid when it achieves certain milestones. Complete a software review? Earn a payment. Prove to NASA that you've built a spacecraft component you said you would? Earn a payment. This kind of contract structure naturally incentivized managers to reach milestones.\n\nThe problem is that while a company might do something that unlocks a payment, the underlying work may not actually be complete. It's a bit like students copying homework assignments throughout the semester. They get good grades but haven't done all of the learning necessary to understand the material. This is only discovered during a final exam, in class. Essentially, then, Boeing kept carrying technical debt forward so that additional work was lumped onto the final milestones.\n\nBoeing, as we've all recently seen, is no longer an aeronautics company -- it's a profit company, the kind of business you get when MBAs hellbent on \"efficiency\" take over from the engineers. That mindset didn't vibe well with a government contract, and the so-called \"efficiencies\" never showed up to help. Ars Technica continues:\n\nThere was no single flight software team at Boeing. The responsibilities were spread out. A team at Kennedy Space Center in Florida handled the ground systems software, which kept Starliner healthy during ground tests and the countdown until the final minutes before liftoff. Separately, a team at Boeing's facilities in Houston near Johnson Space Center managed the flight software for when the vehicle took off.\n\nNeither team trusted one another, however. When the ground software team would visit their colleagues in Texas, and vice versa, the interactions were limited. The two teams ended up operating mostly in silos, not really sharing their work with one another. The Florida software team came to believe that the Texas team working on flight software had fallen behind but didn't want to acknowledge it. (A Boeing spokesperson denied there was any such friction).\n\nThe full Ars Technica piece is worth a read, as it goes into the myriad ways that Boeing failed with the Starliner project. Cost fixations, siloed developmentx, a lack of proper testing, even the company's lack of vertical integration all worked together to kneecap the project. Going to space is hard enough when you aren't focused on doing it as cheaply as possible.", "source": {"uri": "jalopnik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jalopnik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-price_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-price contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-plus_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost-plus contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Technica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ars Technica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aeronautics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vertical integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/c3b4c95c43d0ef91ef037681681b878a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540745", "eventUri": "eng-9540745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Wilmore also wrestled and played baseball, according to the school's yearbook.\n\n\"It means a lot to my family,\" said Wilmore's father, Eugene Wilmore, about the city and school's pride for his son.\n\nWilmore on Earth\n\nEugene Wilmore lived 44 years in Mt. Juliet and now resides in Hermitage. Barry Wilmore grew up in the Una Antioch area before moving with his family to Mt. Juliet in the third grade. He attended the former Lakeview Baptist Church.\n\n\"When he was in space last time, my wife was alive and we carried on the best we could,\" Eugene Wilmore said. \"He was able to communicate with us and (we) actually had live chats with him. We never really got nervous when he was preparing and actually going into space. Many, many people prayed for him, and prayers do make a difference.\"\n\nBarry Wilmore graduated from Tennessee Tech with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1985, a master's degree in electrical engineering in 1994 and was inducted into the school's Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nHe participated in a live-chat from space with Tech students during a previous mission and \"continues to leave an indelible mark on this campus,\" Tennessee Tech President Phil Oldham said.\n\nWilmore and wife Deanna have two daughters. They live outside of Houston. He is a lay elder at Providence Baptist Church in Pasadena, Texas, where he has taught children, been involved in a prison ministry, done building projects and has gone on mission trips outside the country.\n\n\"When I first met him,\" staff elder Tommy Dahn said, \"I asked him what he did for a living, and he said 'I work at NASA.' Nothing is below him. He never stops. And his mind is so organized.\"\n\nWilmore is still very much a Tennessean and plans to bring memorabilia like a Predators jersey and hat, a Tennessee Tech football and baseball jersey, a Tennessee state flag and other local items onboard the Starliner.\n\nWilmore, Williams and a 'true test assignment'\n\nThe Starliner launch with a human crew has encountered delays because of technical complications. The spacecraft has made trips to the International Space Station without astronauts.\n\nThe flight and stay is estimated for one to two weeks.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program contracted with Boeing to have a spacecraft system able to travel to the ISS, in part to have a second option if one isn't operational.\n\nSpaceX is also under contract with the Commercial Crew Program and has performed crew rotation missions to the space station since 2019 with its Dragon capsule.\n\nThe goal when both spacecraft are certified is to rotate them regularly on space station missions as a cost-effective transportation mode that will also enhance research, according to NASA Commercial Crew Program spokesperson Steven Siceloff.\n\nThe Starliner has a \"great amount of automation,\" Williams said, and has \"robust\" backup modes that include the ability for the crew to operate it manually if necessary.\n\n\"A lot of delays are things you want to find,\" Wilmore says about the long awaited launch. \"And along the way we have cleared up so many potential pitfalls.\n\n\"I didn't plan to be here at this point. But here we are. It's a great opportunity for our nation. I don't think about it personally to be honest with you, but my part is to benefit our nation and the goals our nation has. That is truly what drives me.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennessean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tennessean"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Juliet,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mount Juliet, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mount Juliet, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

Sometime after NASA halted its space shuttle program, it awarded Boeing more than $4 billion to build what became the Starliner, which later fell in competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX fleet of spacecraft.\n\nMeanwhile, seasoned NASA test pilots Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, with Navy flight experience, suit up in preparation for tonight's historic launch, marking it as the first test flight with a crew onboard.\n\nHere are the space travelers onboard the Boeing Starliner:\n\nWilmore, 61, will be the Starliner's commander in tonight's flight. He is a retired Navy combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, who flew in combat missions during Operation Desert Storm.\n\nHe earned a Master of Science in Aviation Systems from the University of Tennessee in 1994 while attending the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California.\n\nWilmore eventually became a NASA astronaut in 2000 and has since piloted spacecraft in two NASA missions; aboard the Atlantis shuttle in 2009 and the Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2014. He and fellow crew member Sunita Williams were assigned as the spacecraft's crew in 2022 after bearing witness to Starliner's previous two test flights, running through constant training that they say helped them get more familiar with the craft.\n\n\"We found some things that needed to be rectified. And that's just part of the process,\" Wilmore told The Tennessean. \"That's one of the exciting things about being in the role that we're in.\"\n\nWilmore has a wife, who is a former local beauty pageant winner in Tennessee, and two daughters who live in Texas.\n\nWilliams, 58, will be the mission's pilot, overseeing the flight's progress and manually taking control of the craft whenever necessary. She served as a helicopter pilot in deployments to the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean Sea in support of Desert Shield during the Gulf War.\n\nWilliams, of Indian descent, left her hometown of Needham, Massachusetts, to pursue her studies for her Master of Science degree in engineering science from Florida Tech in 1995.\n\nShe became a NASA astronaut in 1998 and has flown and spent time at the ISS twice during space missions in 2006 and 2012. She boarded NASA's Discovery space shuttle in 2006 then a Russian-built Soyuz spacecraft in 2012. During her time at ISS, she held the record for maximum spacewalk time by a female - she spent 50 hours and 40 minutes across seven spacewalks, according to NASA.\n\nHer dream to board Starliner has come in due time, after years of advocating for the flight to happen.\n\n\"It's been tough watching our SpaceX colleagues fly again and again,\" Williams told Knoxville News Sentinel. \"But that fact has made us the Starliner crew.\"\n\nWhen on solid ground, Williams and her husband Michael like spending time with their dogs, exercising and working on cars, airplanes and other projects.\n\nIf tonight's mission goes to plan, it would open up greater opportunities for NASA to invite astronauts aboard the final six of its future missions set until 2030.", "source": {"uri": "whas11.com",

Boeing plans to launch a Starliner capsule within a few hours, which will take two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). It will smell new - the car has never transported people before.\n\nThe stakes are high: For Boeing, the Starliner represents an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to safely carry people into orbit and fend off growing criticism of its quality control procedures. For NASA, this is an opportunity to reduce its reliance on SpaceX for space missions and add a new model to its space taxi fleet.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nTen years ago, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX worth up to $6.8 billion to replace the retired space shuttle program and fly astronauts to the International Space Station. Elon Musk's company is the only one to have completed this task so far:\n\nSpaceX has completed nine crewed flights for NASA since 2020, not to mention four private flights with astronauts. Boeing, which has been plagued by a series of technical problems, has made only two test flights of the Starliner, neither of which carried humans. This turned out to be a good decision: During one test, the spacecraft's on-board computer was turned off for 11 hours, wreaking havoc. In total, the Starliner program was delayed for seven years and cost an additional $1.5 billion. More than I expected budget.\n\nEven if Starliner impresses on its inaugural crewed mission, the benefits of the space taxi business are unclear to Boeing. The International Space Station is scheduled to retire in 2030, meaning Boeing can only fly a maximum of six more missions for NASA. Furthermore, production problems for the Boeing 737 MAX began with a door seal blown in January of this year. -Resulted in cash flow of $3.9 billion. in the first quarter, raising questions about Boeing's ability to finance its commercial space ambitions.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson is confident about the Starliner: \"It's a clean spacecraft that's ready to launch.\"\n\nThe Starliner is scheduled to take off on Tuesday at 4:34 a.m. Polish time from Cape Canaveral.

Ahead of the CFT, SpaceX founder Elon Musk took to social media to throw shade at his rival company. \"Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner. Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1. Too many non-technical managers at Boeing,\" the tech billionaire wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nMusk's tweet came in response to Senior Space Editor at Ars Technica Eric Berger's \"deep dive into why Starliner is seven years late\" in the article- The surprise is not that Boeing lost commercial crew but that it finished at all. The article explores the years of setbacks and losses the company faced due to its \"structural inefficiency,\" among other factors. Berger discusses various factors, including software issues and problems with the propulsion system, in the days leading up to the first crewed mission of Starliner.\n\nIn 2014, NASA chose both Boeing and SpaceX to transport US astronauts to the ISS.

Ahead of the CFT, SpaceX founder Elon Musk took to social media to throw shade at his rival company. \"Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner. Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1. Too many non-technical managers at Boeing,\" the tech billionaire wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nMusk's tweet came in response to Senior Space Editor at Ars Technica Eric Berger's \"deep dive into why Starliner is seven years late\" in the article- The surprise is not that Boeing lost commercial crew but that it finished at all. The article explores the years of setbacks and losses the company faced due to its \"structural inefficiency,\" among other factors. Berger discusses various factors, including software issues and problems with the propulsion system, in the days leading up to the first crewed mission of Starliner.\n\nIn 2014, NASA chose both Boeing and SpaceX to transport US astronauts to the ISS.

Credits: NASA/Robert Markowitz\n\nNASA and Boeing are targeting an early February 2023 launch for the first CST-100 Starliner flight with astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nPreparations are underway for the launch of NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test (CFT) as teams work to ready the hardware, crew, and mission support teams for flight as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nTwo NASA astronaut test pilots, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Suni Williams, will fly on CFT to the space station, where they will live and work for approximately eight days. Mission and crew support teams and the CFT astronauts are continuing with preparations and training. NASA and Boeing teams recently conducted an integrated crew exercise to rehearse the prelaunch timeline and responses to various launch event scenarios. In the coming weeks, Wilmore and Williams will don their spacesuits and climb aboard their crew module to check out the vehicle systems and interfaces that support their health and safety.\n\nRefurbishment of the CFT crew module following the first Orbital Flight Test in December 2019 is progressing. Its external shell and thermal protection system will be completed next, followed by preflight checks to finalize the crew module build and test phase. Production of a new service module also is progressing, with teams wrapping up acceptance testing of the thermal control system, installing the pressurant system and integrating the propulsion system. This service module incorporates the same valve mitigations as the OFT-2 spacecraft. That purge system performed as needed during OFT-2 and a similar system has been implemented into the service module for CFT as a preventative measure. Once both the crew module and service module are completed, the two will be mated for flight.\n\n\"The Starliner team has done an excellent job throughout the refurbishment process of incorporating all the learning from our uncrewed orbital test flight,\" said Steve Stich, manager, NASA's Commercial Crew Program. \"We expect to do even more learning on our next flight with astronauts to set Starliner up for certification and future operational missions.\"\n\nDuring OFT-2, which launched May 19, Starliner spent six days in space, orbited the Earth 94 times and covered a total distance of 2,467,406 miles. Starliner achieved all flight test objectives and mission operations demonstrations, including rendezvous and docking maneuvers and the ability to execute an abort if needed once in the vicinity of the space station. Additionally, Starliner had a normal launch, trajectory, orbital insertion, and approach, rendezvous and docking with space station.\n\nThroughout the OFT-2 data reviews, the team has verified Starliner's subsystems performed as needed during the flight. This included environmental control and life support, landing, power, guidance navigation and control, docking and ascent abort emergency detection system validation, and atmospheric entry with aero-deceleration.\n\nNASA and Boeing also are working to close out the OFT-2 in-flight anomalies prior to Starliner's next flight with astronauts. Those include the early shutoff of some thrusters and a cooling loop anomaly. System enhancements to improve crew interfaces and streamline spacecraft operations are also planned.\n\n\"We knew we would learn a lot from the flight and there would be some fine-turning needed to make the systems work together and operate fully as intended,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager, Boeing Starliner. \"We'll fly when we're ready and are excited to have Butch and Suni onboard our next mission.\"\n\nFor the crewed flight, Boeing's Starliner will launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nFollowing a successful CFT mission, NASA will begin the final process of certifying the Starliner spacecraft and systems for crew missions to the space station. Regular commercial crew rotation missions enable NASA to continue the important research and technology investigations taking place aboard the orbiting laboratory. Such research benefits people on Earth and lays the groundwork for future exploration. As part of Artemis, NASA will send astronauts to the Moon to prepare for future human exploration of Mars. Inspiring the next generation of explorers - the Artemis Generation - ensures America will continue to lead in space exploration and discovery.\n\nNASA and Boeing leadership hosted a media teleconference on Aug. 25 to provide an update on CFT.

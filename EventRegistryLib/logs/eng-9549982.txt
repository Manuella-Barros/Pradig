But when it comes to hydrogen produced from natural gas, they told council members in a recent letter that they don't see evidence it will help Edmonton decarbonize.\n\n\"Grey\" hydrogen and \"blue\" hydrogen are both made from natural gas, and that process produces greenhouse gas emissions -- but blue hydrogen integrates carbon capture and storage.\n\nThe committee's letter says there are still outstanding concerns about the environmental cost of extracting the natural gas to produce blue hydrogen and questions about the efficiency of carbon capture efforts.\n\n\"As we as a city consider throwing our proverbial hats into the blue hydrogen ring, we must understand that there is a real possibility that, by doing this, we may not actually improve affordability, or reduce our emissions, in any significant way,\" the May 2 letter says.\n\nWithout a detailed analysis of the potential cost to Edmonton taxpayers and a third-party analysis of the whole picture of emissions associated with blue hydrogen, the committee recommends that no city projects or plans should incorporate it for decarbonization.\n\nCommittee co-chair Jacob Komar told CBC News that there's a time and place for blue hydrogen, pointing to heavy industry like fertilizer and steel production, where hydrogen is the only real alternative to fossil fuels.\n\n\"But to use it for space heating or transportation is very wasteful,\" he said, noting zero-emissions options for personal vehicles and home heating already exist, and they're more efficient.\n\n\"It's not just us coming up with this and saying this ourselves. We're saying this because there's huge scientific concern that this will ever be a solution.\"\n\nHydrogen has been broadly promoted in Alberta, with the provincial government rolling out a hydrogen roadmap in 2021 for expanding a \"clean hydrogen economy.\" The federal government also released a Canada-wide hydrogen strategy in 2020.\n\nRyan Fournier, press secretary for Alberta Environment Minister Rebecca Schulz, said in a statement Monday that the province is \"technology agnostic\" on clean hydrogen development.\n\n\"We support any type of hydrogen production, including electrolytic green hydrogen, as long as the produced hydrogen is low carbon intensity, and meets our province's economic and environmental goals,\" he said.\n\nA City of Edmonton spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that Edmonton's interest in hydrogen \"is aligned with both the provincial and federal governments' priorities in emissions reduction and clean energy.\"\n\nHydrogen is considered \"green\" when it's split from water using renewable electricity, producing no emissions. The climate resilience committee's position is that pursuing blue hydrogen doesn't automatically make it easier to switch.\n\n\"By promoting the use of blue hydrogen we risk locking Edmonton into long-term carbon-intensive hydrogen generating processes. The city's stated goals are exactly the opposite.\"\n\nThe city currently has one hydrogen-fuelled bus in its fleet, running as part of a pilot project. Plans to expand are paused for now, with council opting earlier this year to hold off on buying 40 new hydrogen fuel-cell buses because of financial constraints.\n\nWard papastew Coun. Michael Janz, one of two council advisers appointed to the energy transition climate resilience committee, said the memo to council gives him pause.\n\n\"I think any time we have someone saying, 'Hey, the sparkle doesn't match the shine here,' we need to take a look at that. If anything, having this information gives us ammo to ask better questions,\" he said.\n\nWard pih\u00easiwin Coun. Tim Cartmell told CBC News he's aware of the issues highlighted by the committee but said it is just one consideration for the city when it comes to making budget decisions and trying to reduce emissions.\n\n\"I don't think that we're we're all in [on hydrogen], but there's also a risk of perfect is the enemy of good here,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to replace half our bus fleet over the next 10 years, and we have no way to do that.

Gavin Newsom's push to ramp up the renewable fuel carries risks: increased emissions and pollution.\n\n\u00d7 Expand\n\nHans Gutknecht/The Orange County Register via AP\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference at World Energy Paramount in Paramount, California, May 1, 2023.\n\nThis article was produced by Capital & Main, an award-winning publication that reports from California on economic, political, and social issues. It is co-published here with permission.\n\nA plan by California business groups to accelerate a hydrogen industry has gained ground after two state Senate committees approved legislation to create a renewable energy sector nearly from scratch.\n\nHydrogen associations, including investor-owned gas utilities, car manufacturers and oil conglomerates, are now promoting the bill and weighing what regulations to put in place.\n\nAs the bill moves through the Legislature, Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is lobbying the U.S. Department of the Treasury to get a break from emission restrictions on hydrogen production while state agencies, at times, have echoed the talking points of the hydrogen industry itself. California was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy for a $1.2 billion hydrogen hub investment, and companies could benefit from an additional $10 billion in tax credits, proponents of the measure said.\n\nMore from Capital & Main\n\nCritics, such as environmentalists, emissions experts and utility reformers, worry that hydrogen boosters are pushing California into a risky regulatory framework, motivated by financial incentives in President Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act. If implemented incorrectly, the state's proposed hydrogen plan could actually increase emissions, they said.\n\nHydrogen, an element and renewable fuel that does not emit greenhouse gasses when burned, is abundant in nature but hard to produce in pure form without releasing harmful emissions. Nearly all elemental hydrogen is produced by heating fossil methane gas in steam until the gas's hydrogen and carbon molecules separate. There are also fossil-fuel-free alternative processes to produce hydrogen. But they too have problems.\n\nCompanies can generate hydrogen from renewable methane gas derived from landfills, dairy manure, agricultural waste, and forest overgrowth -- all methods that generate pollution.\n\nAlternatively, machines known as electrolyzers can produce clean hydrogen by separating hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water. But that method is expensive and consumes vast amounts of electricity, which has climate consequences.\n\nSenate Bill 1420 proposes that low-carbon-sourced hydrogen made either through electrolysis or from renewable methane should be considered clean, and requires that by 2045, 60% of all hydrogen used in fuel cell vehicles be clean. It would also allow hydrogen producers to qualify for faster environmental reviews under the California Environmental Quality Act, which currently only apply to sectors such as solar, wind and thermal power plants and transmission projects.\n\nBut opponents said the bill has multiple problems. It leaves the door open for fossil-fuel-sourced hydrogen in vehicles through midcentury. It entrenches gas collection at dairy farms, which pollutes the air and water of nearby rural communities and leaks climate-warming methane when piped and refined.\n\nProducing hydrogen cleanly is a challenge. If an electrolyzer is plugged directly into California's grid, the hydrogen it produces would not be clean.\n\nAnd most consequentially, opponents said, the provisions for electrolytic hydrogen could cause climate emissions to rise without the proposed safeguards that Newsom now opposes. The U.S. Treasury Department seeks to avoid such an outcome by offering tax credits for clean hydrogen production.\n\n\"Simply requiring that hydrogen be produced using renewable resources, without any additional criteria, will not achieve\" statewide decarbonization goals, warned Matthew Freedman, renewables attorney with The Utility Reform Network, who testified about hydrogen before the California Assembly.\n\nEven if the electricity used to make hydrogen comes from solar or wind, Freedman said, it could pull clean power that's now being used elsewhere on the state's power grid. Without an ample supply of clean energy, power plants burning fossil fuel gas would likely have to make up the shortfall.\n\nBackers argue that California must move quickly to reap the benefits of federal incentives. Guidelines for the hydrogen hub money require states to build up their supply and delivery of clean hydrogen by 2030. California's hub plan only makes financial sense if it can take advantage of those tax credits, supporters said.\n\n\"If we want to move away from fossil fuels, we have to ask, 'What is the alternative?'\" said Janice Lin, president of the Green Hydrogen Coalition, another supporter of the bill. \"It all points to renewable hydrogen.\"\n\nHydrogen has the potential to be used as a fuel for long-distance transportation by planes, ships and freight and passenger trains, according to the International Energy Agency. It is essential for chemical processes at steel plants and ammonia manufacturers, though neither have a big presence in California, Lin said.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board estimated that to reach its emissions goal, the state needs 1,700 times more hydrogen than it currently uses. Other potential uses for hydrogen, according to the state, are as a source of heat for paper manufacturing, fuel to replace diesel in trucks and to blend with natural gas in pipelines connected to homes and businesses.\n\nBut with so much federal money available, there is a risk that it \"becomes economical to waste energy due to these tax credits,\" said Dan Esposito, manager, electricity, at Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a think tank. If not for hydrogen's potential for reducing emissions and the available federal money to produce it, \"nobody would be talking about it, because it is very, very expensive\" to make, he said.\n\nOne example of such waste, Esposito said, is burning hydrogen with fossil gas in electricity plants as part of a lower-carbon blend. Another is having too many buses or trucks relying on hydrogen fuel cell technology instead of being powered directly by electricity. Even injecting hydrogen into gas lines, which environmentalists oppose, would replace only 7% of the energy provided by fossil gas.\n\nSupporters said there are other benefits that make it worth using so much energy to produce hydrogen. Those include faster refueling for heavy vehicles and storing hydrogen for long-term use when wind and solar are not available.\n\nBut producing hydrogen cleanly is a challenge. If an electrolyzer is plugged directly into California's grid, the hydrogen it produces would not be clean.\n\nCalifornia's current energy mix would result in 11 kilograms of carbon emissions for every kilogram of hydrogen produced -- \"roughly comparable to\" the methods for making hydrogen from fossil methane, said Jesse Jenkins, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University, during a legislative hearing in Sacramento on building a zero-carbon hydrogen economy in California.\n\nCalifornia now has six years to rev up its hydrogen industry after two decades of state subsidies failed to do so, according to an analysis of the hydrogen bill.\n\nThe Treasury Department's solution to such problems is to offer tax credits to hydrogen producers who ensure that their electricity comes from clean sources that adds to existing clean electricity already on the grid. That would prevent producers from monopolizing the grid's renewable power. They would also have to confirm that the clean power goes to electrolyzers as it is generated.\n\nSuch requirements could \"delay the advancement of clean renewable hydrogen production in California,\" said Jack Brouwer, director of the Clean Energy Institute at U.C. Irvine, at the hearing in Sacramento. He was heavily involved in preparing California's hydrogen hub application.\n\nNewsom's administration has asked the Treasury Department for an \"alternative compliance pathway\" to comply with federal rules for clean hydrogen production. It argued that the state's climate goals already ensure a cleaner grid over time and offer protection against emission increases.\n\nFreedman, the Utility Reform Network attorney, said he viewed Newsom's request as a \"fiction,\" in part because the state is already struggling to meet near-term climate goals.\n\nThe industry has made a similar case as Newsom, but went a step further to minimize potential effects.\n\n\"The demand that electrolytic hydrogen will place on the grid is a small fraction\" of the total grid demands as California electrifies cars and buildings, said Teresa Cooke, executive director of the California Hydrogen Coalition, a lobbying firm whose partners include Air Liquide S.A., Chevron Corp. and Shell USA Inc.\n\nIn its plans to replace fossil fuels use throughout the state, California wants to triple the size of its power grid, mostly with wind and solar, by 2045. But the electricity needs of hydrogen are hardly negligible.\n\nThe state forecast that it will need 21 gigawatts of power annually for hydrogen electrolyzers alone by 2045, the equivalent of about half the current peak demand on the grid on a hot summer day. Additional hydrogen would come from renewable methane from biogenic sources -- raising the same local pollution concerns residents have already flagged.\n\nCalifornia now has six years to rev up its hydrogen industry after two decades of state subsidies failed to do so, according to an analysis of the hydrogen bill by the state Senate's Environmental Quality Committee. \"It is unclear how these policies will bolster hydrogen's role in sectors\" where it can be useful, it said.", "source": {"uri": "prospect.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Prospect"}, "authors": [],

safety protests", "body": "The Government has scrapped plans for a pilot 'hydrogen town' with thousands of homes heated by low carbon gas amid a wave of protests and questions over the technology.\n\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it was halting work until at least 2026, when 'strategic decisions' on the role of hydrogen in decarbonising heat will be made.\n\nProposals for a pilot town heated by hydrogen instead of polluting natural gas were first outlined as part of Boris Johnson's 10-point plan in 2020 for a 'green industrial revolution' to cut climate emissions to zero overall, known as Net Zero.\n\nBut proposals for two hydrogen villages, in Redcar and Whitby, near Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, were abandoned after locals protested at being treated as who feared being 'lab rats'.\n\nProposals for two hydrogen villages, in Redcar (pictured) and Whitby, near Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, were abandoned after locals protested at being treated as who feared being 'lab rats'.\n\nIn 2022 gas distribution networks were invited to put forward outline plans for a scheme involving at least 10,000 properties, for the Government to deliver plans by 2025 for a possible pilot hydrogen town by the end of the decade.\n\nBut a number of studies and experts have said hydrogen - which can be low carbon, depending on how it is produced, and potentially piped through the existing gas network into buildings for use in hydrogen boilers - will only have a small role to play in heating homes and other buildings in the future.\n\nLast year, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended the Government should not support the rollout of hydrogen heating.\n\nEnergy efficiency minister Lord Callanan said: 'We have decided not to progress work on a hydrogen town pilot until after 2026 decisions on the role of hydrogen for heating.\n\n'Heat pumps and heat networks will be the main route to cutting household emissions for the foreseeable future.'\n\nAs hydrogen is easier to ignite and is more prone to leaking than natural gas, homes would have had to undergo some changes in order for the system to be installed.\n\nThe experiment was seen as the last chance to prove whether hydrogen heating can work in the UK.\n\nLaast year Northern Gas Networks (NGN) was criticised over safety measures relating to plans to supply 2,000 homes in Redcar.\n\nEarly safety assessments recommended that homes should have holes drilled in their walls in order to prevent the gas leaking and setting alight, according to The Telegraph.\n\nNGN said that this was unnecessary and instead proposed using high-tech sensors to find leaks.\n\nResponding to today's announcement, Juliet Phillips, from climate policy think tank E3G, said: 'Discussions on hydrogen for heating are an unhelpful distraction that muddy the waters on the future of how we heat our homes.\n\n'Today's decision makes clear that all attention and investment should be focused on readily available clean heat solutions, like heat pumps and heat networks.'\n\nShe said green hydrogen - a low carbon source of the gas made using renewable power - was likely to be an 'expensive and scarce resource' which needed to be reserved for niche applications in industry, power and transport.\n\n'Widespread use of hydrogen for heating is widely understood to be an extremely expensive and inefficient way to meet net zero targets, which could exacerbate fuel poverty,' she warned.\n\n'Attention now needs to be turned to how we can ensure a fair and well-managed transition away from fossil gas - considering how to support jobs and decommission parts of the network,' she added.\n\nA spokesperson for the UK gas distribution networks said: 'We welcome the clarity which has been provided on a potential hydrogen heating town and continue to support the need to make use of a range of energy solutions if we are to reach net zero in a fair and affordable way for customers that maintains choice.\n\n'As an industry, we will keep working closely with the Government to provide the evidence and expertise required to make an informed decision on the future decarbonisation of home heating.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki",

Initially part of Boris Johnson's ambitious 10-point plan for a \"green industrial revolution\" in 2020, the project was intended to help achieve net zero emissions by replacing natural gas with hydrogen in at least one town.\n\nIn 2022, gas distribution networks were asked to submit preliminary proposals for a project that could encompass over 10,000 homes, with the Government aiming to finalise plans by 2025 for a potential hydrogen town trial by decade's end. However, several studies and specialists have cast doubt on hydrogen's viability as a major heating source for residential and commercial buildings, suggesting its role may be limited.\n\nFollowing advice from the National Infrastructure Commission last year, the Government was urged not to proceed with widespread hydrogen heating systems.\n\nhe move to halt plans for a hydrogen town come after proposals for two hydrogen villages, in Redcar and Whitby, Ellesmere Port, which faced local opposition, were abandoned.\n\nThe Government said low carbon hydrogen may have a role to play in heat decarbonisation, alongside heat pumps and heat networks, \"but in slower time in some locations\".\n\nEnergy efficiency minister Lord Callanan said: \"We have decided not to progress work on a hydrogen town pilot until after 2026 decisions on the role of hydrogen for heating. Heat pumps and heat networks will be the main route to cutting household emissions for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nResponding to the announcement, Juliet Phillips, from climate policy think tank E3G, said: \"Discussions on hydrogen for heating are an unhelpful distraction that muddy the waters on the future of how we heat our homes.\n\n\"Today's decision makes clear that all attention and investment should be focused on readily available clean heat solutions, like heat pumps and heat networks.\" She said green hydrogen - a low carbon source of the gas made using renewable power - was likely to be an \"expensive and scarce resource\" which needed to be reserved for niche applications in industry, power and transport.\n\n\"Widespread use of hydrogen for heating is widely understood to be an extremely expensive and inefficient way to meet net zero targets, which could exacerbate fuel poverty,\" she warned. \"Attention now needs to be turned to how we can ensure a fair and well-managed transition away from fossil gas - considering how to support jobs and decommission parts of the network,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_beament@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Emily Beament", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Energy_Security_and_Net_Zero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department for Energy Security and Net Zero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boris Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellesmere_Port", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ellesmere Port"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ellesmere Port"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitby", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Whitby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article32772402.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_plans-for-a-pilot-hydrogen-town-have-been-halted-tim-goodepa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

This year, in a chromite mine in Albania, he and his colleagues struck gold, or rather another element on the periodic table. Nearly a kilometer below the surface, they discovered a hydrogen seep so strong it turned a murky drainage pond into something resembling a Jacuzzi. Truche had never seen hydrogen bubbles that big. \"It was really intense,\" he says.\n\nNatural hydrogen is hydrogen gas in its molecular form (H) that is generated through natural processes. Formed deep within Earth, it may get trapped on its way to the surface, creating accumulations of gas. Confusingly also called \"gold,\" \"white\" or \"geological\" hydrogen, natural hydrogen could offer us an energy source cleaner than other types of hydrogen because there is no carbon involved in the process that generates it (although drilling and distribution would still involve some carbon dioxide emissions, of course). A recent study estimated the greenhouse gas intensity of natural hydrogen to be 0.4 kilogram of CO equivalent per kilogram (kg COeq/kg), far less than the 22-26 kg kg COe/kg of black hydrogen (produced from coal) or the 10-14 kg COe/kg of blue hydrogen (produced from natural gas).\n\nThe Albania discovery was the latest in a string of similar findings that have recently spiked interest in naturally occurring hydrogen. When last year geologists discovered natural hydrogen in old coal deposits below Folschviller, a dilapidated mining town in northern France, local media went abuzz with hope. Some called it \"the new petrol.\" Others called it \"a game changer.\" And the words \"El Dorado\" have been uttered, too. But Truche casts a cautionary note, calling the fervor over the discoveries a \"hydrogen fever.\" \"In one sense, it is wonderful because it attracts attention, funding and lots of motivation to move forward, he adds. \"But in another sense, it's also kind of a Wild West -- with lots of overstatements.\"\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

What was known, however, was that hydrogen could be produced deep within our planet through a process called serpentinization, which occurs when water reaches iron-rich rocks from Earth's mantle. The reaction transforms the rocks and liberates hydrogen from water molecules. Other processes, too, were known to produce hydrogen, such as radiolysis -- the splitting of water molecules by radiation from uranium and other radioactive elements within Earth's crust. Yet it was taken for granted that hydrogen, the lightest molecule, would seep through rock layers and escape into the atmosphere instead of pooling in reservoirs like petroleum does. Scientists recognized as well that hydrogen was easily consumed by microbes, which, the theory went, would make reservoirs even less likely. \"I've spent 30 years doing oil and gas research and very much had this mentality that, yeah, hydrogen is out there, but you could never get accumulations,\" says Geoffrey Ellis, a geochemist at the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThen, in 1987, workers attempting to drill a water well in the Malian village of Bourak\u00e9bougou noticed an unusual breeze emanating from the hole. When one of the workers lit a cigarette, the gas exploded into a bright flame -- the breeze turned out to be almost pure hydrogen. For safety reasons, the well was soon cemented shut. In 2012 it came back to life when a Canadian company, now called Hydroma, began combusting the hydrogen to supply local residents with electricity, the first such production site in the world. A few years later, Hydroma took up drilling around Bourak\u00e9bougou and found more deposits containing natural hydrogen.\n\nWhile scientists consider the findings in Mali to be evidence that natural hydrogen accumulations are indeed possible, there were other signs of their presence. In Turkey a site called the Chimaera seep, located under a temple dedicated to Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire, has been emanating hydrogen since antiquity. In Australia wells drilled in search for oil on Kangaroo Island in the 1920s and 1930s were found to produce high levels of hydrogen -- up to 84 percent of the total composition of the gas retrieved. Now, after Truche and his colleagues' analysis of the geology of the Albanian site, their discovery adds to the growing pile of data indicating that natural hydrogen can be trapped underground. \"They provided some really compelling evidence that gas accumulation has been there for quite a long time,\" Ellis says.\n\nSo how did we miss it? How did we not see that hydrogen may be trapped in potentially exploitable deposits? According to Linda Stalker, a geologist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Australia's national research agency, scientists simply weren't looking for these reservoirs. Decades ago, before the threat of climate disaster had gained its current prominence, there wasn't much incentive to search for a new energy source. And because many hydrogen accumulations appear to be located in more shallow layers than oil and gas, crews likely just drilled through them. \"You're speeding straight through to go way deeper. You're not sampling; you're not measuring; you're not looking,\" Stalker says.\n\nAnother reason for the oversight was far more prosaic: a common method employed by the petroleum industry to analyze gas reservoirs involves using hydrogen as a carrier gas, which masks natural hydrogen found in deposits. This is why scientists are now going back to reanalyze old data and recheck old wells. \"People are starting to realize that we need to go out there and try and measure again -- and look for hydrogen,\" Stalker says.\n\nWhen Truche and his colleagues sifted through a database of French drilling records, they found previously ignored evidence of high hydrogen concentration in boreholes along a fault line in the Paris Basin. Meanwhile on the Yorke Peninsula in Australia last October, the energy company Gold Hydrogen drilled a new well parallel to one that was discovered to contain hydrogen back in the 1930s. And the gas was still there.\n\nRevisiting old sites is not the only way to identify potential reservoirs of natural hydrogen. Isabelle Moretti, a geologist at the University of Pau and the Pays de l'Adour in France, travels the world in search of \"fairy circles\" -- elliptical depressions with sparse plant cover enclosed by lush vegetation. Such depressions can now be spotted with the help of Google Earth. From the U.S. to Namibia, Russia and Australia, fairy circles have been associated with hydrogen seeping to the surface, infusing the soil. The bizarre appearance of a fairy circle, Moretti says, is likely caused by the way hydrogen migrates upward and changes the soil microbiome, which then affects vegetation. \"The circle is compatible with one leakage point at a certain depth, then the gas going up to the surface,\" Moretti says.\n\nWhile fairy circles may be signs of the presence of geological hydrogen, they don't guarantee the existence of underground reservoirs. \"If there is no seal or an impermeable rock, it will all escape into nature,\" Moretti said. This is why scientists are working to identify which types of rocks can effectively trap natural hydrogen. In Mali, such a rock appears to be dolerite -- a dark magmatic rock similar to basalt. Salt can also potentially act as a seal for escaping hydrogen, and so can volcanic sills, horizontal magma intrusions between rock layers. \"People realize that, in fact, a lot of rocks are able to stand up to some columns of hydrogen,\" Moretti says. Once such a cap is in place, a reservoir may form.\n\nUsing current knowledge on natural hydrogen production, trapping and migration, Ellis and his colleague at the USGS have built an unpublished model to estimate how much hydrogen might be actually stored underground. They came up with an estimate of somewhere between thousands and billions of megatons, with the most probable number hovering at \"about five million megatons,\" Ellis says. With the 2022 global hydrogen demand standing at 95 megatons that seems huge. But, Ellis admits, \"there is a lot of uncertainty about all the inputs that go into this model.\" What's more, most of these hydrogen deposits would be unusable from a commercial perspective. \"It's likely going to be too far offshore or just too deep or something that's just too small, so that it would never be economic to be produced,\" Ellis says.\n\nYet even with smaller numbers, hope is not quashed. In February the U.S. Department of Energy announced selections for grants representing the nation's first-ever major funding for advanced technologies for extracting natural hydrogen from within deep rock formations. While natural hydrogen reservoirs may be different from those known to the oil and gas industry, Moretti says, they should appear quite familiar to people working in the geothermal industry. Some of the tools for natural gas drilling would find their place on natural hydrogen fields, too. Australia's Gold Hydrogen has estimated that the quantity of hydrogen it might recover from sites on Yorke Peninsula and the nearby Kangaroo Island to be about 1.3 megatons. In Spain another company hopes to produceup to 70,000 metric tons per year, beginning in 2029. And in the U.S. two companies have drilled in Nebraska and Arizona -- for now, they have kept their results private, says Viacheslav Zgonnik, natural hydrogen researcher and CEO of Natural Hydrogen Energy LLC.\n\nNatural hydrogen could power our cars, light our houses and provide a cleaner alternative for all of the industries that are currently dependent on methane, from cement to steel production. Yet it could also prove to be another unicorn that keeps us distracted from implementing clean energy solutions that are less glamorous but more demanding. It may keep us deluded that a deus ex machina will save us from climate catastrophe, even if our industrial societies continue a business-as-usual approach. There are other risks, too. A2022 study warned that once hydrogen escapes into the air, it may impact atmospheric chemistry, increasing the levels of methane and ozone, two potent greenhouse gases. That is why \"it is crucial to prioritize the management of leakages throughout the extraction, transportation and storage processes,\" says Matteo Bertagni, a biochemist at Princeton University and the study's lead author.\n\nSo far, Stalker says, the natural hydrogen industry appears to be at a stage similar to where the oil and gas enterprises were 120 years ago. \"It's going to be high-risk, high-reward for the foreseeable future,\" she says. For Ellis, meanwhile, one of the concerns is that people might give up too early -- as soon as a few wells turn out to be dry. \"It's impossible to say today whether this will be commercially viable,\" he says. But \"we may need to drill dozens or hundreds of wells before we understand how to make this work.\"", "source": {"uri": "scientificamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scientific American"},

A startup in Australia claims it has a way to do that.\n\nHysata, based in Wollongong, south of Sydney, has raised US$111mil (RM526mil) from investors to scale up its technology to produce hydrogen from electricity. The company's advantage is the energy efficiency of its electrolyzer, a machine that separates hydrogen out of water.\n\nGreen hydrogen is currently much more expensive than the alternative that's made from polluting fossil fuels, hindering its adoption. But investment is ramping up to try and close that gap, with governments around the world providing hefty subsidies to incentivise its production. Spending on electrolyzers more than tripled last year to US$8.7bil (RM41.2bil), according to BloombergNEF.\n\nHydrogen, a key input in making ammonia and refining oil, is today mostly made with fossil fuel. That resulted in some 900 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2022, according to the IEA. Using renewable electricity to produce the gas, which only produces water when burned, can make it more climate friendly. So-called green hydrogen could potentially displace natural gas and coal in other heavy-emitting processes like steel production, shipping and power storage that have few alternatives to lower emissions.\n\nTo understand Hysata's technology, it helps to look inside an electrolyzer. The machines apply electricity to water and split the compound into its constituent elements of hydrogen and oxygen. It's quite easy to make an electrolyzer at home that generates small quantities of hydrogen. All you need is two pieces of solid metal, some wire, salty water and a source of electricity.\n\nThe challenge of making a good electrolyzer is to ensure that it converts as much of the electricity into making hydrogen as possible. That's because the price of hydrogen is mainly determined by the cost of electricity used to make it: higher efficiency means lower cost.\n\nToday's state-of-the-art commercial electrolyzers convert about 75% of electricity into hydrogen. One of the big reasons for the loss in energy comes down to bubbles, which cause water to lose contact with the metal that's crucial for water splitting.\n\nGiven that electrolyzers convert liquid water into hydrogen, you might think bubbles are inevitable. Hysata says it's found a breakthrough to avoid them, though. The company's technique is the product of a decade of work by Gerry Swiegers, Hysata's co-founder and senior professor at the University of Wollongong, and his team in Australia.\n\nAfter trying different materials, including Gore-Tex, his team of researchers landed on using a weird property of water to avoid making bubbles. That property is capillary action, which is when a liquid in a narrow space can rise against the force of gravity. It's one of the forces trees use to draw water from the ground all the way to the leaves at the top.\n\nThe resulting electrolyzer involves a thin layer sponge in the middle, which draws water upward through capillary action. On either side of the sponge are porous metal plates containing nickel, which come into contact with a thin layer of water. When electricity is applied to this cell, water is split into hydrogen and oxygen that first dissolve in the liquid and are transported out through the porous electrodes without making bubbles. The resulting efficiency, Swiegers says, is 95%.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it was real,\" Swiegers said. \"I thought there may be an error in our experiments, so we got my best people to reproduce the experiments repeatedly. And we kept getting these good results.\"\n\nHysata's estimates suggest the discovery will result in cost savings of \"double digits\". Part of that comes from requiring less energy to make hydrogen, but it also comes from not needing equipment that other electrolyzers use to manage cooling or high-pressure pumps.\n\nSwiegers founded Hysata in 2021 along with chief executive officer Paul Barrett and Chief Product Officer Tom Campey. The company aims to use the money it has raised now to scale up its workforce and manufacturing capacity to commercialize a technology.\n\nHysata's investors include the venture arms of British oil major BP Plc and wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems A/S, South Korean steel maker Posco Holdings Inc and Templewater, an investment group co-founded by ex-Deutsche Bank AG banker Cliff Zhang.\n\nHysata isn't the only company that claims to have found a way to make hydrogen with 95% efficiency. Israel-based H2Pro says that its two-step process for green hydrogen can also breach that mark. There are also companies that use heat and electricity to make green hydrogen, claiming it reduces the overall price of making the gas.\n\nHysata's Barrett says that he expects the startup's commercial-scale units will be deployed as soon as 2025. That's a quick turnaround for a three-year-old startup. \"As far as I know, none of the startups claiming breakthroughs in efficiency have yet scaled up their manufacturing,\" said Martin Tengler, head of hydrogen at BloombergNEF.\n\nStill, the potential market for electrolyzers is rapidly growing. The world is projected to produce 9.6 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2030, up from about 400,000 tons this year, according to BloombergNEF. While that's a major increase, it remains far below the amount global governments say they need to reach their climate ambitions. - Bloomberg", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wollongong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wollongong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steelmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vestas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/05/09/2685330.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

A startup in Australia claims it has a way to do that.\n\nHysata, based in Wollongong, south of Sydney, has raised $111 million from investors to scale up its technology to produce hydrogen from electricity. The company's advantage is the energy efficiency of its electrolyzer, a machine that separates hydrogen out of water.\n\nGreen hydrogen is currently much more expensive than the alternative that's made from polluting fossil fuels, hindering its adoption. But investment is ramping up to try and close that gap, with governments around the world providing hefty subsidies to incentivize its production. Spending on electrolyzers more than tripled last year to $8.7 billion, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nHydrogen, a key input in making ammonia and refining oil, is today mostly made with fossil fuel. That resulted in some 900 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2022, according to the IEA. Using renewable electricity to produce the gas, which only produces water when burned, can make it more climate friendly. So-called green hydrogen could potentially displace natural gas and coal in other heavy-emitting processes like steel production, shipping and power storage that have few alternatives to lower emissions.\n\nTo understand Hysata's technology, it helps to look inside an electrolyzer. The machines apply electricity to water and split the compound into its constituent elements of hydrogen and oxygen. It's quite easy to make an electrolyzer at home that generates small quantities of hydrogen. All you need is two pieces of solid metal, some wire, salty water and a source of electricity.\n\nThe challenge of making a good electrolyzer is to ensure that it converts as much of the electricity into making hydrogen as possible. That's because the price of hydrogen is mainly determined by the cost of electricity used to make it: higher efficiency means lower cost.\n\nToday's state-of-the-art commercial electrolyzers convert about 75% of electricity into hydrogen. One of the big reasons for the loss in energy comes down to bubbles, which cause water to lose contact with the metal that's crucial for water splitting.\n\nGiven that electrolyzers convert liquid water into hydrogen, you might think bubbles are inevitable. Hysata says it's found a breakthrough to avoid them, though. The company's technique is the product of a decade of work by Gerry Swiegers, Hysata's co-founder and senior professor at the University of Wollongong, and his team in Australia.\n\nAfter trying different materials, including Gore-Tex, his team of researchers landed on using a weird property of water to avoid making bubbles. That property is capillary action, which is when a liquid in a narrow space can rise against the force of gravity. It's one of the forces trees use to draw water from the ground all the way to the leaves at the top.\n\nThe resulting electrolyzer involves a thin layer sponge in the middle, which draws water upward through capillary action. On either side of the sponge are porous metal plates containing nickel, which come into contact with a thin layer of water. When electricity is applied to this cell, water is split into hydrogen and oxygen that first dissolve in the liquid and are transported out through the porous electrodes without making bubbles. The resulting efficiency, Swiegers says, is 95%.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it was real,\" Swiegers said. \"I thought there may be an error in our experiments, so we got my best people to reproduce the experiments repeatedly. And we kept getting these good results.\"\n\nHysata's estimates suggest the discovery will result in cost savings of \"double digits.\" Part of that comes from requiring less energy to make hydrogen, but it also comes from not needing equipment that other electrolyzers use to manage cooling or high-pressure pumps.\n\nSwiegers founded Hysata in 2021 along with Chief Executive Officer Paul Barrett and Chief Product Officer Tom Campey. The company aims to use the money it has raised now to scale up its workforce and manufacturing capacity to commercialize a technology.\n\nHysata's investors include the venture arms of British oil major BP Plc and wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems A/S, South Korean steel maker POSCO Holdings Inc and Templewater, an investment group co-founded by ex-Deutsche Bank AG banker Cliff Zhang.\n\nHysata isn't the only company that claims to have found a way to make hydrogen with 95% efficiency. Israel-based H2Pro says that its two-step process for green hydrogen can also breach that mark. There are also companies that use heat and electricity to make green hydrogen, claiming it reduces the overall price of making the gas.\n\nHysata's Barrett says that he expects the startup's commercial-scale units will be deployed as soon as 2025. That's a quick turnaround for a three-year-old startup. \"As far as I know, none of the startups claiming breakthroughs in efficiency have yet scaled up their manufacturing,\" said Martin Tengler, head of hydrogen at BloombergNEF.\n\nStill, the potential market for electrolyzers is rapidly growing. The world is projected to produce 9.6 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2030, up from about 400,000 tons this year, according to BloombergNEF. While that's a major increase, it remains far below the amount global governments say they need to reach their climate ambitions.\n\nRead the most up to date Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Industry news at FuelCellsWorks", "source": {"uri": "fuelcellsworks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FuelCellsWorks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wollongong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wollongong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steelmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_splitting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water splitting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vestas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://img.fuelcellsworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-08_11-31-26-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Fortum has announced plans for a hydrogen pilot plant near to its Loviisa nuclear power plant, while OKG has signed a contract with Hynion to supply surplus hydrogen from operations at the Oskarshamn plant to its hydrogen filling stations.\n\nUniper-owned OKG has used electricity produced by the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant in Finland to produce hydrogen through electrolysis of water since 1992. This hydrogen was initially produced to meet the nuclear power plant's own needs: the hydrogen was added to the reactor coolant of the plant's three boiling water reactors in order to reduce the risk of stress corrosion cracking of the reactor piping by reducing the amount of free oxygen in the coolant.\n\nThe hydrogen produced at Oskarshamn is now only required for use in unit 3 of the nuclear power plant following the permanent closure of units 1 and 2 in June 2017 and December 2016, respectively, leaving an overcapacity. OKG has modernised the hydrogen plant to expand operations and signed its first contract to supply fossil-free hydrogen from the plant to industrial gases company Linde in 2022.\n\nAll businesses in Uniper's portfolio have two main tasks: to ensure a secure energy supply and to drive the energy transition, and the company is playing an important role in the establishment of Europe's hydrogen economy and the development of a significant business in renewable energy, OKG CEO Johan Lundberg said. \"It's fantastic that the surplus production we sell can help Hynion with hydrogen to their hydrogen filling stations so that together we can contribute to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\"\n\nHynion said the partnership represents an important part of its strategy to reduce dependence on individual suppliers as it prepares for increasing hydrogen-powered traffic in Sweden. \"We need stable producers who, together with us at Hynion, want to contribute to the energy transition and a carbon-free future. The hydrogen delivery from OKG is an important step to secure the supply of hydrogen at our stations,\" said Hynion AS CEO Slavica Djuric.\n\nIn a separate announcement, Finnish utility Fortum said it will build a hydrogen production pilot plant in in the K\u00e4lla area near the company's Loviisa nuclear power plant. Construction of the test centre, on land already owned by the company, will begin this summer, and the plant is scheduled to be commissioned in late 2025.\n\nHydrogen will be produced by electrolysers with a capacity of around 2 MW, using electricity from the main grid and local domestic water supplies in Loviisa. A filling station will be built in connection with the plant for the delivery of hydrogen to industrial customers. The K\u00e4lla test centre is expected to be in operation for around two years, and the total R&D cost of the pilot project is around EUR17 million (USD18.3 million). The test centre is being funded entirely from Fortum's research and development funds.\n\n\"Testing hydrogen production at the Kalla test centre on a megawatt scale will provide valuable information not only in terms of the design and operation of potential larger plants, but also of the business opportunities provided by green hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives,\" said Satu Sipola, vice president of Power-to-X at Fortum. \"The pilot project is the first step towards possible future projects and investments.\"\n\n\"Fortum has a strong position in clean energy production, and we strive to find solutions to help our industrial customers decarbonise their operations. We work to drive the development of clean hydrogen in the Nordic countries, and we engage in active research cooperation with companies in the forest, steel and chemical industries and the transport sector, for example,\" Sipola said.", "source": {"uri": "world-nuclear-news.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Nuclear News (WNN)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskarshamn", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oskarshamn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oskarshamn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortum", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fortum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coolant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loviisa_Nuclear_Power_Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boiling water reactor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis of water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corrosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniper", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nordic countries"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loviisa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loviisa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Loviisa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-", "dateEnd": "2016-12-", "textStart": 953, "textEnd": 980}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It follows the decision last year to scrap a number of smaller scale 'hydrogen village' pilot projects, following opposition from local residents and a fierce debate over the feasibility and cost effectiveness of upgrading the gas network to enable hydrogen to be used for home heating.\n\nThe government had planned to begin a \"large village trial\" of hydrogen heating by 2025 that would then provide evidence to inform a decision in 2026 on the wider role of hydrogen in decarbonising heating systems across the country.\n\nBut today the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said the government \"has decided not to progress work on a hydrogen town pilot until after 2026 strategic decisions on the role of hydrogen in decarbonising heat.\"\n\nDESNZ noted the decision \"follows careful consideration of the future of the work in light of the decision in December 2023 not to proceed with the hydrogen village trial in Redcar.\"\n\nIn late April, gas network SGN announced it was pushing the launch of the H100 Fife Project - a green hydrogen heating trial - to the summer of 2025, citing supply chain challenges and procurement challenges.\n\nAnd today, DESNZ said it had not completely ruled out the use of hydrogen for heating in the UK, as it reiterated its plan to assess evidence from pilots in the UK and abroad before delivering a final decision in 2026.\n\n\"We believe that low carbon hydrogen may have a role to play in heat decarbonisation, alongside heat pumps and heat networks, but in slower time in some locations,\" it said. \"We plan to take a decision in 2026 on whether, and if so how, hydrogen will contribute to heating decarbonisation. We will assess evidence from our wider research programme, the neighbourhood trial in Fife and similar schemes across Europe, to take this decision.\"\n\nThe shelving of various hydrogen trials has played into an ongoing debate over the economics, climate impact, and safety of hydrogen fuel as a solution for decarbonising home heating.\n\nAdvocates of hydrogen heating argue it offers a less disruptive alternative to fossil gas boilers than switching millions of homes to heat pumps or district heating networks, and could deliver cost reductions in the long term if delivered at scale.\n\nBut dozens of studies have argued hydrogen is unlikely to play a significant role in a low-carbon heating system, concluding alternative solutions, such as electric heat pumps and district heat networks, are typically cheaper to install and run, and can deliver steeper emissions cuts for households and the UK as a whole. There are also concerns about whether green and low carbon hydrogen can be produced at sufficient scale to decarbonise home heating across the country, given the fuel is likely to be used by other industries that are less amenable for electrification.\n\nThe debate has sparked an increasingly intemperate war of words, with advocates for hydrogen briefing the media that heat pumps are too expensive and difficult to install in many properties, and environmental groups accusing the gas industry of lobbying for a high cost solution designed to lock in continued demand for fossil gas.\n\nGovernment Ministers have signalled they expect heat pumps to play the dominant role in decarbonising home heating, but have resisted calls for pull forward the 2026 date for a formal decision on whether there could be some role for hydrogen heating in parts of the country.\n\nEnergy and climate experts today argued the decision to cancel a third government-backed hydrogen heating trial should sound a death knell for any hopes of hydrogen heating being deployed at scale in the UK.\n\nJuliet Phillips, UK energy programme lead at think tank E3G, said discussions on hydrogen for heating were an \"unhelpful distraction that muddy the waters on the future of how we heat our homes\".\n\n\"Today's decision makes clear that all attention and investment should be focused on readily available clean heat solutions, like heat pumps and heat networks,\" she added. \"Green hydrogen is likely to be an expensive and scarce resource, which needs to be reserved for niche applications in industry, power and transport.\n\n\"Widespread use of hydrogen for heating is widely understood to be an extremely expensive and inefficient way to meet net zero targets, which could exacerbate fuel poverty. Attention now needs to be turned to how we can ensure a fair and well-managed transition away from fossil gas - considering how to support jobs and decommission parts of the network.\"\n\nWriting on social media platform X, former Energy Minister Chris Skidmore said it was \"time to accept it is game over for hydrogen for domestic heating\".\n\nWant to understand what is going on at the cutting edge of sustainability?

It complained of a large discrepancy between planned projects and final investment decisions.\n\nAn upward trend in announced hydrogen plans had \"intensified somewhat\", rising from 8.7GW in August 2023 to 10.1GW in February 2024. But many remain \"theoretical for the time being\", the report said.\n\nGermany has a goal of installing 10GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030. Of 88 announced projects, a final investment decision has only been made for 16 projects totalling 300MW.\n\nAlthough the EU's 'delegated acts' of June 2023 on the definition of renewable hydrogen had led to greater legal certainty overall, E.on said that uncertainties remain on certification and crediting of renewable hydrogen.\n\nFunding is still insufficient, the company added, and strict conditions and delayed funding commitments are further barriers to investment.\n\nE.on complained of insufficient transport and storage infrastructure.

The region accounts for over 75% of global active capacity, with 1.4mtpa of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity currently in operation.\n\nNorth America currently holds a strong position in the global hydrogen market, accounting for up to 75% of global active capacity. Although recent months have seen increased project activity from the APAC region, North America will continue to hold a significant share of the global hydrogen market with over 75mtpa of upcoming capacity, which represents 36% of total upcoming capacity. Canada will continue to lead the region's hydrogen market, with GHI's Spirit of Scotia project providing the country with a notable edge in terms of its production outlook, alone accounting for 43mtpa of capacity, making it the largest scale low-carbon hydrogen project in the world. The United States follows with 10mtpa of capacity across its active and upcoming projects. Meanwhile, Mexico remains a slow mover within the region's hydrogen market, with just 94ktpa of capacity across all of its active and upcoming projects.\n\nTransportation remains the dominant end-use sector for the region's emerging low-carbon hydrogen market, with company announcements across active and upcoming projects indicating that up to 43mtpa of hydrogen capacity will be allocated to the transport sector. Hydrogen's use within transportation will take place both domestically as well as low carbon hydrogen serving as valuable export to demand centres in Europe. Although hydrogen continues to struggle to compete with BEVs in the light vehicle segment, both Canada and the United States have been active in their support of pilots within the heavy transport sector ranging from buses, and trucks as well as hydrogen refuelling infrastructure for roads and airports. Although production volumes allocated to other sectors are lower, industries such as iron & steel are increasingly becoming focus sectors for hydrogen adoption.\n\nRecent policy movements particularly from the United States have sent reverberations through both North America's regional market as well as the global hydrogen market more broadly. Policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have led to increased activity within the United States' hydrogen economy, with tax credits as well as funding opportunities for hydrogen developers greatly boosting the economic viability of producing hydrogen in the coming years. Other important policy movements include Canada's Clean Technology Investment Tax credit as well as its bid to become a leading supplier of low-carbon hydrogen through its pursuit of international trade agreements.\n\n* North America's low-carbon hydrogen capacity outlook\n\n* Key regional projects\n\n* Key companies operating in North America's hydrogen market\n\n* Hydrogen end use sectors\n\n* Hydrogen policy in North America at both the national and regional level\n\n* Deal activity related to hydrogen in North America\n\n* Company filings analysis of North America headquartered companies\n\nAlthough the region is still set to experience a decline in terms of its capacity share, North America will continue to hold a strong standing. This will be particularly true in terms of its ability to scale production, with the largest project globally being based in Canada.\n\nIn a low case scenario with lower policy support, North America's hydrogen capacity would reach 24.3mtpa by 2030.\n\nThe bulk of the region's low-carbon hydrogen capacity is currently being attributed to the transportation sector. This is chiefly driven by the capacity of GHI's Spirit of Scotia project, which will exclusively direct its 43mtpa of green hydrogen capacity towards the transportation sector.\n\nIdentify the market trends within the region and key players in hydrogen technologies.\n\nDevelop market insight of current, in development and announced capacity and latest trends of the sector.\n\nUnderstand the region's different scenarios for 2030 based on the likeliness of the projects.\n\nLook at the demand in key application areas for the country.\n\nFacilitate the understanding on how and where the market is growing as it is rapidly scaling up to position as one of the main topics of the international and national agenda.", "source": {"uri": "globaldata.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Market Research Reports & Consulting | GlobalData UK Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clean technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

"Argyll green hydrogen production facility gets planning approval", "body": "A plan to produce green hydrogen on the west coast of Scotland has received planning approval from Argyll and Bute Council.\n\nScotland-based energy company GreenPower is planning to produce 46MW of green hydrogen at its Argyll Hydrogen Hub, located at the Glenshellach Industrial estate in Oban, Argyll and Bute.\n\nThe proposed site is close to GreenPower's 46MW Carraig Gheal wind farm near Oban, and the company said it aims to supply hydrogen using renewable energy powered electrolysers.\n\nGreenPower is aiming to supply hydrogen for ferries, HGVs, buses, trains and other industrial processes in the region to transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nThe company said it is also actively considering the potential for hydrogen production at its other energy projects, including the proposed Barrachander wind farm.\n\nGreenPower director of green hydrogen Paul Minto said the planning approval will put Oban and the wider region \"on the UK green hydrogen map\".\n\n\"Green hydrogen is an important zero-carbon fuel that can help meet climate obligations while delivering sustainable fuel for a wide range of purposes,\" Mr Minto said.\n\n\"In Argyll there are several sectors currently dependent on fossil fuels where fuel-switching could radically reduce carbon emissions, and where jobs can be created through local production and use of green hydrogen.\"\n\nMr Minto said GreenPower expects begin production at the Argyll site by the end of 2025, with the company currently exploring potential industrial offtakers.\n\n\"There is significant potential to decarbonise the transport sector including buses and coaches, HGVs serving distilleries, fish farms, forestry operations, refuse collection vehicles, and with a longer-term opportunity to fuel ferries, planes and trains,\" he said.\n\n\"Green hydrogen could also replace carbon-intensive fuels such as heating oil and LNG used in hospitals, leisure centres, care homes and industrial operations.\"\n\nGreenPower chief executive officer Rob Forrest said the approval will lead to more \"clean, green jobs and more economic development\" in the region.\n\n\"Argyll has all the ingredients for the creation of a clean, environmentally responsible, local energy system based on green hydrogen,\" Mr Forrest said.\n\n\"This marks the beginning of significant growth and Argyll could become a green hydrogen hub for export to the rest of the country.\"\n\nAccording to Scottish Development International, the potential market for renewable hydrogen production in Scotland is estimated to be 126 terawatt hours (TWh).\n\nThe Scottish Government has set a target to produce up to 25GW of renewable or low carbon hydrogen by 2025.\n\nLast year, the Scottish Government announced a \u00a37 million investment in 32 renewable hydrogen projects across the country.\n\nThe UK government also announced \u00a32 billion in government funding for 11 major electrolytic hydrogen projects, including two projects based in Scotland.\n\nOther green hydrogen projects taking shape in Scotland include a project exploring the use of hydrogen to power aircraft at airports in Aberdeen and Glasgow.\n\nSeveral green hydrogen projects centred on decarbonising the Scottish whisky industry, including projects at distilleries in Ardmore and Glenrothes.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh have also developed a method of turning the sector's wastewater into green hydrogen.\n\nBut the largest green hydrogen project is centred on Kintore, with Statera Energy's \"world scale\" plans for a 3GW facility placing the Aberdeenshire town in the same league as Saudi Arabia's Neom and the Port of Rotterdam.",

obligations while delivering sustainable fuel for a range of purposes\".\n\nIt will now build a production and distribution centre at the Glenshellach Industrial Estate in Oban, with plans to help distilleries and fish farms move away from using fossil fuels.\n\nGreen hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water and powered by renewable energy, and the company hopes it could also be used for heating.\n\nIt is also exploring potential hydrogen production at the proposed Barachander Wind Farm, the sister project to Carraig Gheal Wind Farm, a 20-turbine project operated by GreenPower in west Argyll.\n\nThe green hydrogen project is expected to open at the end of 2025 and could potentially export the fuel around the country.\n\nIn December, the UK Government announced funding for 11 green hydrogen projects, which it described as \"essential to achieving our net zero targets\".\n\nPaul Minto, director of green hydrogen at GreenPower, said: \"With this planning consent for the Argyll Hydrogen Hub we are putting Oban on the UK green hydrogen map.\n\n\"In Argyll there are several sectors currently dependent on fossil fuels where fuel-switching could radically reduce carbon emissions, and where jobs can be created through local production and use of green hydrogen.\n\n\"There is significant potential to decarbonise the transport sector including buses and coaches, HGVs serving distilleries, fish farms, forestry operations, refuse collection vehicles, and to fuel ferries, planes and trains.\n\n\"Green hydrogen could replace carbon-intensive fuels such as heating oil and LNG used in hospitals, leisure centres, care homes and industrial operations.\"\n\nRob Forrest, chief executive of GreenPower, said: \"We already have renewable energy facilities in Argyll and are delighted with this approval, which means we can take further steps in the region to create clean, green jobs and more economic development.\n\n\"We can see a future where all heavy road transport and shipping is powered by green hydrogen, and where any industry using heating oils or gas can switch fuels to run on environmentally friendly green hydrogen.\n\n\"Argyll has all the ingredients for the creation of a clean, environmentally responsible, local energy system based on green hydrogen and could become a green hydrogen hub for export to the rest of the country.\"", "source": {"uri":

Our proven capability means that we can develop and progress projects at pace for customers and we look forward to building demand across multiple sectors. We have also invested in digital technologies that will enable continuous improvement in how we design, optimise, and operate our hydrogen plants in the future.\"\n\nIn Q4 2024, Protium will open its second hydrogen production facility, making it the only company in the UK with two operational facilities producing commercially available hydrogen from renewables.\n\nScaling up production to meet the demand seeded by Pioneer 1, the new facility will feature a 2.5MW electrolyser. Ten times larger than Pioneer 1, this facility will reduce carbon emissions by 156,000 tonnes annually - the equivalent of removing 37,000 cars from UK roads.\n\nChris Jackson, Chief Executive of Protium said: \"Green hydrogen will be a critical part of the energy mix in helping the UK achieve its target of zero emissions by 2050. However, the nascent stage of the hydrogen sector makes projects like Pioneer 1 crucial for cultivating the necessary experience, skills, and market demand necessary for the sector's growth.

It will assess evidence from a pilot in Fife in Scotland, and similar schemes in Europe.\n\nBut many experts, including the government's infrastructure tsars, believe that the UK should focus its efforts on electric heating options, such as heat pumps, while hydrogen should be reserved for use in heavy industry which is not always able to use electricity.\n\nJuliet Phillips, the head of UK energy at E3G, an independent climate change thinktank, said the government's decision had made clear \"that all attention and investment should be focused on readily available clean heat solutions,

hydrogen for heating is widely understood to be an extremely expensive and inefficient way to meet net zero targets, which could exacerbate fuel poverty.\"\n\nJess Ralston, the head of energy at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said the decision would pave the way for more investment into heat pumps, which boost energy security by lowering the amount of gas the UK needs to import as output from the North Sea continues to decline.\n\n\"The US and Europe are already installing heat pumps in their millions in response to the gas crisis that has already cost the UK over \u00a3100bn,

Furthermore, less than 1% of UK hydrogen is produced using green methods and it might be better used by heavy industry that does not so readily have low-carbon alternatives for process energy and feedstocks.\n\nThen in December, the sole remaining village pilot, planned for Redcar, was abandoned after Northern Gas Networks was unable to source the low-carbon hydrogen it needed to run the 2,000-home trial.\n\nThe government said its decision on a town trial will now wait until after 2026 once it has more evidence including from a smaller neighbourhood trial under development in Fife, Scotland, and schemes across Europe.\n\nIn a statement, the government said: \"We believe that low-carbon hydrogen may have a role to play in heat decarbonisation, alongside heat pumps and heat networks, but in slower time in some locations. We plan to take a decision in 2026 on whether, and if so how, hydrogen will contribute to heating decarbonisation.\"\n\nThe neighbourhood trial under development in Fife is set to start in 2025. A new 8 km pipeline network will provide 300 homes with hydrogen for heating and cooking. The hydrogen will be produced using an electrolyser powered by offshore wind.", "source": {"uri": "thechemicalengineer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thechemicalengineer.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Redcar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redcar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitby", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whitby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Whitby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boiler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/13395/924nrdgreengas.png?width=960", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Their next task could be to help the continent's sluggish hydrogen markets take off.\n\nHoegh LNG Holdings Ltd., a provider of floating storage and regasification units for liquefied natural gas, is working on a hybrid ship that can deliver gas and hydrogen in parallel.\n\nThree bigger tanks in such a vessel would be dedicated to LNG, while the smallest tank at the front would store ammonia, a carrier for hydrogen. A module for converting the ammonia into green hydrogen will be installed on board. Such ships can start operating by 2028, according to Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at the Norwegian firm.\n\nWhile hydrogen -- especially its green variant -- is crucial to Europe's energy transition goals, buyers have been reluctant to make commitments because of its high costs. Hoegh's approach of starting small works on the growing acceptance that natural gas will continue to play a role during the lengthy transition to green fuels.\n\n\"One of the challenges that you will have when we start building hydrogen markets is that in the beginning, demand is going to be limited,\" Thorkildsen said in an interview. \"It doesn't make a lot of sense having a huge onshore tank dedicated to ammonia or hydrogen before the demand in the market is there.\"\n\nThe market is looking at ammonia as a medium for transport and storage of green hydrogen, with trade eventually evolving to resemble that of LNG. Costs to produce ammonia as well as green hydrogen are expected to decline in coming years, making it competitive with fossil-fuel-based alternatives, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nFor now, demand for import terminals for LNG is still growing as Europe transitions from Russian pipeline gas to consume more tanker-borne fuel, Thorkildsen said. But an interest in the transporting hydrogen in parallel is growing in Europe, he added.\n\n\"The capacity in that unit is perfect to allow the start of building a market,\" he said. \"It is a very flexible solution, which allows you to maintain natural gas sendout, because natural gas is here to play an important role.\"\n\nRead the most up to date Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Industry news at FuelCellsWorks", "source": {"uri": "fuelcellsworks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FuelCellsWorks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ammonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquefied natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://img.fuelcellsworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-08_13-39-40-1024x595.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

by GreenPower has been approved by Argyll and Bute Council to produce green hydrogen, which it describes as \"a zero-carbon fuel that can help meet climate obligations while delivering sustainable fuel for a range of purposes\".\n\nIt will now build a production and distribution centre at the Glenshellach Industrial Estate in Oban, with plans to help distilleries and fish farms move away from using fossil fuels.\n\nGreen hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water and powered by renewable energy, and the company hopes it could also be used for heating.\n\nREAD MORE: SNP government issues update on future of independence white papers\n\nIt is also exploring potential hydrogen production at the proposed Barachander Wind Farm, the sister project to Carraig Gheal Wind Farm, a 20-turbine project operated by GreenPower in west Argyll.\n\nThe green hydrogen project is expected to open at the end of 2025 and could potentially export the fuel around the country.\n\nIn December, the UK Government announced funding for 11 green hydrogen projects, which it described as \"essential to achieving our net zero targets\".\n\nPaul Minto, director of green hydrogen at GreenPower, said: \"With this planning consent for the Argyll Hydrogen Hub we are putting Oban on the UK green hydrogen map.\n\n\"In Argyll there are several sectors currently dependent on fossil fuels where fuel-switching could radically reduce carbon emissions, and where jobs can be created through local production and use of green hydrogen.\n\n\"There is significant potential to decarbonise the transport sector including buses and coaches, HGVs serving distilleries, fish farms, forestry operations, refuse collection vehicles, and to fuel ferries, planes and trains.\n\n\"Green hydrogen could replace carbon-intensive fuels such as heating oil and LNG used in hospitals, leisure centres, care homes and industrial operations.\"\n\nREAD MORE: SNP LGBT group raises concerns as Kate Forbes made

the region to create clean, green jobs and more economic development.\n\n\"We can see a future where all heavy road transport and shipping is powered by green hydrogen, and where any industry using heating oils or gas can switch fuels to run on environmentally friendly green hydrogen.\n\n\"Argyll has all the ingredients for the creation of a clean, environmentally responsible, local energy system based on green hydrogen and could become a green hydrogen hub for export to the rest of the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

However, brands seem to have lost interest in developing prototypes that look almost futuristic. We have seen it again with this new stratospheric hydrogen engine, which exceeds 500 hp and has a massive injection that we have never seen before.\n\nMAN Engines PLC has presented an innovatively new hydrogen engine that is designed to be used in heavy-duty equipment: tractors, power generators stationed permanently at construction sites, as well as agricultural machinery. The 16.8-liter V12 engine produce an astonishing 500 horsepower.\n\nThis power comes out clean will water vapor as the only greenhouse benefit; yet it is already an example of climate-friendly-engine-technology. Unlike battery-electric solutions, hydrogen engine are on point with performances by offering power, torque and load response like diesel engines.\n\nIt is possible to directly perform its functions instead of engines without significant reduction in productivity and efficiency. The motor's constructional plan, which is based on many decades of experience in making heavy-duty diesel engines by MAN, makes a strong engine.\n\nWithout releasing CO2 gas and being much less noisy in operation, the hydrogen engine provides an environmentally friendly solution to decarbonization for sectors outside roadway applications that have tried to go electric.\n\nMAN Engines new fuel hydrogen engine is extravagantly powerful for both sheer size and workload. 500 hp top power and 16.8 litres displacement, make it one of the globes hydrogen engines with large outputs developed to date, as you could imagine.\n\nThe V8 configuration permits power to be generated of not only high horsepower, but also a substantial amount of torque output. Since hydrogen engines are mostly smaller basing on 4, 6 cylinder sizes that are suitable for light duties.\n\nThe fact that the 16 can produce 500-horsepower power underlines only its tremendous effectiveness. 16.8 liter three-way hydrogen power system is a huge step forward. This proves that hydrogen is able to be used for high power applications, managing to keep the performance at the same level, maybe even higher.\n\nMAN D1556, a hydrogen-powered engine of the latest generation, is currently the only one that operates on pure hydrogen fuel. It ensures zero-emission operations of heavy-duty machinery and vehicles. The D1556 differs from many hydrogen prototypes in that there is no need for a pilot ignition from the diesel fuel source.\n\nThe engine is a multiple fuel motor, which is able to function on either diesel-hydrogen mixture or pure hydrogen. In case of unavailability of pure hydrogen, the diesel-hydrogen blend is used. The diesel becomes the spark, which ignites the hydrogen when the synthesis process takes place.\n\nThe D1556 injector system also meets the requirements of the current emission regulations by providing 16.8 liter per minute included gaseous hydrogen injection flow into the 350 bar pressure. Such pressure is given a high injection so that the concentrate of the hydrogen can be in the form of spray which ends to combustion.\n\nThis hydrogen engine could be the beginning of a new generation (the third, if we take into account the previous ones we have shown you). The injection is forever changed, bringing more power to the whole and allowing it to surpass the psychological barrier of 500 hp. Will we see it in top brands? Of course, don't expect it in Tesla, but do expect it in a German one.", "source": {"uri": "ecoticias.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ECOticias.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAN_SE", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MAN SE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_machinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agricultural machinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stratosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tractor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V12_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V12 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engine displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Farm_and_Ranch_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Farm and Ranch Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Professional_Exams", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Professional Exams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_6359-1400-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

In fact, we are seeing more and more news about a fuel that has turned out to be better and that only produces water vapor as an emission. Do you know which one we are talking about? We want to introduce you to a new hydrogen engine, but not just one more, but the one that opens a completely different and more advanced generation: with this detail that amazes experts.\n\nThe Hyundai Motor Group in line with this future outlook recently unveiled a novel hydrogen fuel cell that is compatible with the next generation of hydrogen-powered vehicles. The new engine is the big change in the field of hydrogen fuel cells technology and provides all these advantages that the traditional ICEs don't have.\n\nThe key technological factor is a newly developed engine that produces more than 400 horsepower of force but only water vapor is released. This is the main reason why this fuel source is the most commonly used for car engines of all sizes, including compact cars, medium-sized SUVs and even heavy trucks.\n\nAside from performance, it even allows for sustainability benefits. This engine is capable of harnessing hydrogen to serve as fuel and eliminating the emission of greenhouse gases against the vehicles employing it. In such a transition, clean and renewable hydrogen sources like solar and wind might be possible by these vehicles.\n\nEventually, the hydrogen fuel cell engine by Hyndai will just be a step to the generation of cars that are truly capable, and environment-friendly. The engine is equipped with a stunning power output, a range and an efficiency which make it a very suitable option for drivers.\n\nThe new hydrogen engine developed by Hyundai and Kia produces an impressive 400 horsepower and 392 lb-ft of torque from its 6.1 liter V8 displacement. This rear-wheel drive engine utilizes direct injection technology to optimize efficiency.\n\nSome key specs of the hydrogen engine:\n\nThe high-revving nature allows it to generate substantial power, while the torque arrives low in the powerband. This provides strong off-the-line acceleration. The engine is designed for endurance as well, using an iron block and head along with sodium filled exhaust valves.\n\nIn hydrogen fuel cells, the hydrogen is converted into hydrogen ions which are then used to produce electricity, thereby yielding a significant increase in efficiency when compared to the gasoline engines. Unlike traditional engines, fuel cells directly convert chemical energy into electricity via an electrochemical reaction.\n\nThe hydrogen fuel cell engine that achieved high efficiency performance by Hyundai and Kia is a good example of these fuel economy gain. It has about above 400 horsepower maximum power output but just 0. 7 kg H2 on 100km - that's approximately 2 times the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAs a result, a high-performance gasoline engine would need more than ten liters per 100 km, which is three times more than this all-electric one. Fuel cells have various benefits in comparison to the battery electric cars. Among them there is their efficiency.\n\nConcerning hydrogen vehicles, it must be noted that when green energy is utilized for hydrogen production, it is apparent that the overall well-to-wheel efficiency becomes higher than conventional BEV. It is exactly this that gave hydrogen an advantage over range transportation where weight and loading time is a concern.\n\nAs you can see, this hydrogen engine could be the beginning of a new generation marked by the arrival of the long-awaited extended range, a concept that we already know in EVs (specifically, in REx), but that we still haven't seen with this fuel. The secret? You've already seen it, the nearly skyrocketing thermal efficiency they've achieved, something they will now continue to try to improve before commercializing this prototype on a large scale.", "source": {"uri": "ecoticias.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ECOticias.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_injection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuel injection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrol_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petrol engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engine displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel_Cells", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel Cells", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Professional_Exams", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Professional Exams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hydrogen-engine-xataka.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The activist-driven draft rules that Treasury published in December make it extremely difficult and costly to qualify for the credit, which means hydrogen will not be produced at the volumes necessary to supply the need. Green hydrogen producers are required to source their power from new zero-emission sources and match their hydrogen production to the carbon-intensity of the grid on an hourly basis.\n\nMeanwhile, so-called \"blue\" hydrogen producers must use a national average to estimate upstream emissions, meaning there's no incentive to use the cleanest natural gas to produce hydrogen. Both are policies that will result in the same outcome: less clean hydrogen on the market and higher costs, all of which was completely foreseeable last May.\n\nIt is notable now that individual companies are speaking up and warning about cancelling planned investments. Last year it was all speculative, and activists dismissed industry warnings as just fearmongering. Well, now companies are clearly not playing around.\n\nHere are some examples of just a few big hydrogen investments that could be paused or cut entirely as a result of the unworkable rules:\n\nMark Klewpatinond, global business manager for hydrogen at Exxon Mobil, told the Houston Chronicle: \"If we're not able to differentiate natural gas production, it's highly unlikely Baytown would proceed. It needs to compete for capital against other projects we have.\"\n\nKathleen Barr\u00f3n, executive vice president and chief strategy officer for Constellation, told the BloombergNEF Summit held in New York City in mid-April that her company, which is already producing hydrogen using electricity from one of its nuclear power plants, will file for the 45V production tax credit despite the fact that the project does not meet the draft criteria. Barron said Constellation was prepared to \"visit with the courts to sort out whether the final guidance is consistent with the statute.\"\n\nAxios reported on May 6 that metals giant Fortescue's CEO Andrew Forrest says the company will cancel its own major investments in hydrogen unless significant changes to the Section 45V credit regulations are made. \"Projects we have across North America will stop\" without such changes being implemented, Forrest said.\n\nFortescue's array of hydrogen-related investments in the United States include a federally subsidized plant in Washington state, another plant in Arizona and a car manufacturing site in Michigan. All are now in jeopardy.\n\nThese announcements by major companies seeking to commit billions to new hydrogen-related projects if the rules make sense fly in the face of a claim by left-wing activist group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) that industry complaints that the regulations as written \"will hinder industry growth consistently flout on the ground evidence and are contrary to the best analytical findings.\"\n\nRegardless of what \"analytical findings\" NRDC was relying on, the evidence on the ground as of today is clear: The Treasury interpretation as it currently exists will kill billions of dollars in job-creating investments in the United States, exactly as so many warned a year ago.\n\nIn an article published on its website last year, NRDC asserted there is \"no tradeoff between scaling up the industry and safeguarding against emissions increases,\" and that projects \"can be cost-competitive from day one\" under the rules they supported (and which Treasury adopted). But obviously, such a tradeoff does exist and the companies willing to risk billions of dollars on U.S. hydrogen development are not going to move ahead with such investments under a set of regulations that renders their projects non-profitable.\n\nCorporations exist for one reason: To generate profits for their investors. They are not charitable organizations and no amount of high-minded rhetoric and wishful thinking from the climate-alarm lobby can alter that reality.\n\nDavid Blackmon is an energy writer and consultant based in Texas.

Their next task could be to help the continent's sluggish hydrogen markets take off.\n\nHoegh LNG Holdings Ltd., a provider of floating storage and regasification units for liquefied natural gas, is working on a hybrid ship that can deliver gas and hydrogen in parallel.\n\nThree bigger tanks in such a vessel would be dedicated to LNG, while the smallest tank at the front would store ammonia, a carrier for hydrogen. A module for converting the ammonia into green hydrogen will be installed on board. Such ships can start operating by 2028, according to Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at the Norwegian firm.\n\nWhile hydrogen -- especially its green variant -- is crucial to Europe's energy transition goals, buyers have been reluctant to make commitments because of its high costs. Hoegh's approach of starting small works on the growing acceptance that natural gas will continue to play a role during the lengthy transition to green fuels.\n\nRead more: Clean Hydrogen Supply Forecast to Grow 30x by 2030: BNEF Chart\n\n\"One of the challenges that you will have when we start building hydrogen markets is that in the beginning, demand is going to be limited,\" Thorkildsen said in an interview. \"It doesn't make a lot of sense having a huge onshore tank dedicated to ammonia or hydrogen before the demand in the market is there.\"\n\nThe market is looking at ammonia as a medium for transport and storage of green hydrogen, with trade eventually evolving to resemble that of LNG.

Pipeline transport of hydrogen from Norway to Germany is considered technically feasible within 2030.\n\nThere is, however, a need for qualification of technology, such as compressors, valves and flow meters. This qualification can have an impact on the timeline as well as the cost. Additionally, there are other issues, such as clarification of regulatory model, technical and regulatory codes, standards and guidelines for cross-border offshore H2 pipelines, that need to be in place. The integration of Norwegian hydrogen imports into the German hydrogen pipeline network could be possible without delays and without increased overall network costs. The German core network is planned to be regulated.", "source": {"uri": "energycentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Energy Central"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://energycentral.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_meta/public/ece/node_main/2024/5/g1.jpg?itok=FYUSR2Pm", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The project, which wrapped up earlier this year after commencing in April 2018, conducted in-depth analyses of nuclear hydrogen production processes, technologies and economic considerations to further examine the viability of large-scale hydrogen production using nuclear power.\n\nThe CRP produced several robust assessments on the suitability of various reactor types for hydrogen production, including feasibility studies incorporating country-specific factors, and examined the leading production methods, including low- and high-temperature electrolysis and thermochemical cycles such as the sulphur-iodine cycle. The results were used to update the IAEA's Hydrogen Economic Evaluation Programme (HEEP), a tool used to assess the economics of large-scale hydrogen production using nuclear energy. At the recommendation of the chief scientific investigators participating in this CRP as well as the IAEA's Standing Advisory Group on Nuclear Energy, the IAEA will release a roadmap for the commercial deployment of nuclear hydrogen production during 2024.\n\nThe use of hydrogen as a versatile energy carrier is gaining more attention worldwide owing to its potential to assist countries in achieving net zero emission targets. Hydrogen is a central component of electric vehicle fuel cells and is also used in industrial processes such as semiconductor manufacturing, among other applications. For now, fossil fuels power the production of about 95% of the hydrogen utilized today, with the consequence of significant carbon emissions and implications for energy security. Owing to their efficiency and ability to generate process heat, nuclear power reactors are well suited to produce hydrogen in line with the goal of decarbonizing all sectors in order to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nCurrently, there are several hydrogen production demonstration projects underway, with more planned. Research on advanced reactor technologies for hydrogen generation is ongoing in many countries, with several options under consideration: conventional low-temperature electrolysis, high-temperature steam electrolysis, thermochemical cycles as well as steam-methane reforming using nuclear heat. Low-temperature electrolysis involves passing an electric current through water and splitting water molecules into their base components - hydrogen and oxygen. Steam electrolysis works on the same principle but functions at a temperature of between 700\u00b0C and 950\u00b0C. However, thanks to heat recuperation, the heat input required by the manufacturers of the current commercially available high temperature electrolysers can be below 200C. Thermochemical hydrogen production processes work by catalysing chemical reactions with certain compounds at high temperatures in order to split water molecules.\n\nThe CRP 'Assessing Technical and Economic Aspects of Nuclear Hydrogen Production for Near-term Deployment' facilitated research to address some of the key issues related to the potential upscaling of nuclear hydrogen production technologies, including techno-economic analyses of hydrogen production deployment as well as preliminary safety considerations based on the specific cases of participant IAEA member countries.\n\nThe CRP Objectives\n\nThe overall objective of the CRP was to assess the experience gained from research and development on nuclear hydrogen production and the potential for near-term deployment of nuclear hydrogen production.\n\nThe specific objectives were to:\n\nAnalyse the techno-economic aspects associated with upscaling of nuclear hydrogen plants;\n\nAssess aspects relevant to the safety of nuclear cogeneration plants for hydrogen production based on the latest R&D achievements;\n\nUnderstand the potential deployment and time scale of large-scale nuclear hydrogen production technologies for near-term deployment.\n\nImpact and relevance\n\nThe outcome and results of this CRP are relevant for the planning and deployment of nuclear hydrogen production in IAEA Member States, a topic of growing international importance considering the global value of hydrogen in the fight against climate change.\n\nAna Ester Bohe, Senior Researcher in Argentina's Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Energ\u00eda At\u00f3mica (CNEA) and one of the chief scientific investigators in the CRP, said: \"The theoretical feasibility study on the nuclear-assisted gasification process applied to the Argentine Rio Turbio coal (which was conducted during this CRP) is very important for giving our country the technical basis that will be needed during the decision process with regard to nuclear hydrogen production through the gasification of domestic coal.\"\n\nOther key achievements of this CRP include:\n\nDeveloped a techno-economic investigation of hydrogen production deployment, using electrolysis as the hydrogen production process, with solar and nuclear energy for power;\n\nEvaluated nuclear hydrogen production using a thorium molten salt reactor coupled with a solid oxide electrolyser;\n\nAssessed the use of small modular reactor (SMR) technologies for hydrogen production, compression and storage;\n\nAssessed the integration of high-temperature reactors with various hydrogen production processes;\n\nAssessed the integration of hybrid thermochemical cycles with various nuclear power reactors;\n\nDeveloped integration methods for various hydrogen production schemes;\n\nUpdated the IAEA Hydrogen Economic Evaluation Program (HEEP) .\n\nThis CRP had significant academic and human resource development benefits, including the publication of 13 articles in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nTen research contract and agreement holders from Algeria, Argentina, China, Greece, India, Japan, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, T\u00fcrkiye and the United States of America participated in this CRP.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But there are big questions over whether this is a workable solution.\n\nHere are five challenges facing hydrogen-powered aviation.\n\n1. SOURCING CLEAN HYDROGEN WON'T BE EASY\n\nHydrogen can be very clean or very dirty -- it all depends on how it's produced.\n\nMost hydrogen on the market today is so-called gray hydrogen, made by splitting natural gas -- which emits a lot of CO2. Blue hydrogen captures those greenhouse gases, but it costs more and there are worries about where to store CO2. The rarest, and most expensive, is green hydrogen, made by using renewable power to split water.\n\n\"Hydrogen planes will only be as sustainable as the energy that powers them,\" said Carlos L\u00f3pez de la Osa, aviation manager with green group Transport & Environment (T&E).\n\n\"Most hydrogen for transportation is not zero emission today. It's not green hydrogen,\" said Val Miftakhov, CEO of ZeroAvia, a British-American manufacturer that aims to deliver its first hydrogen-electric aircraft with 40 to 80 seats by 2027.\n\n2. HYDROGEN COULD CUT AIRCRAFT RANGE\n\nHydrogen is the lightest element, but it has a much lower energy density than kerosene, meaning aircraft powered by it instead of fossil fuels would actually weigh more.\n\nIt can be burned with oxygen to create water, powering a jet, but it has to be stored in liquid form, which means installing high-pressure tanks that keep the highly flammable substance at temperatures below minus 253 Celsius. All that adds weight, cutting into range, cargo and passenger capacity.\n\nHydrogen can also be used to power a fuel cell, generating electricity to turn a propeller.\n\nAccording to a 2022 McKinsey study, \"with current aircraft designs, hydrogen aircraft could be range limited to up to 2,500 kilometers,\" which is the distance between London and Istanbul. Only \"redesigning airframes and storage technology might unlock longer ranges without reducing the number of available seats.\"\n\nDestination 2050 -- the European aviation alliance for creating net-zero air transport by midcentury, which brings together airlines, airports, manufacturers and navigation service providers -- predicts that hydrogen-powered aircraft will be available by 2035, but only \"suitable for short-range intra-European routes.\"\n\nThat means they can't be used for long-haul flights which Eurocontrol, the European air traffic management body, says are responsible for more than 50 percent of aviation's CO2 emissions.\n\n3. IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE\n\nToday's airports have been set up to refuel airplanes with fossil fuels; they'd have to be revamped to supply hydrogen instead.\n\n\"There's no hydrogen at the airports today,\" said Miftakhov. He's convinced the solution will be to \"make hydrogen on site, at the airports,\" which will reduce transport costs.\n\nIn January, the California Energy Commission, the state's energy policy agency, awarded close to $3.3 million to ZeroAvia to develop a mobile liquid-hydrogen refueling truck that will refuel planes alongside kerosene at the Livermore Municipal Airport.\n\nHowever, the scale of the challenge is daunting.\n\n\"We don't know the full potential of hydrogen in aviation yet, and there are still significant challenges on the road to make it not only technically but also economically feasible,\" said Francisco Jos\u00e9 Lucas, head of sustainable aviation at the Spanish energy multinational Repsol, referring to the difficulties of getting hydrogen to airports. \"Nonetheless, we are sure that it is a technology with great potential in the medium and long term.\"\n\n4. RED TAPE WILL BE A PROBLEM\n\nAviation arguably has the toughest safety standards of any industry on the planet. That means switching to hydrogen will face very high regulatory hurdles.\n\n\"For aircraft with less than 20 passengers, the rules are performance based, and therefore would not require any adaptation\" to hydrogen propulsion, said Janet Northcote, spokesperson for the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).\n\nBut, \"for larger transport aircraft, the regulations are more prescriptive and these would not be appropriate for all aspects in their current form,\" she said.\n\nThe agency does have something called a Special Condition, which allows for novel technologies and has been used for the Airbus A321XLR -- an extra-long range airplane still awaiting certification.\n\nBut in the case of the XLR, that Special Condition applies to a new design for a central fuel tank, not for a novel way of powering flight.\n\nNorthcote said EASA is in touch with hydrogen plane developers through the agency's pre-application services.\n\n\"The pre-application process helps them de-risk their projects and allows us to identify where current regulations may need to evolve,\" she said.\n\n5. NON-CO2 IMPACT\n\nAfter all the effort to convert airplanes from kerosene to hydrogen, even such green machines could still have a negative climate impact.\n\nRecent studies show that about 50 percent to 75 percent of aviation's climate impact is caused by non-CO2 effects -- such as nitrogen oxide emissions or water vapor -- that contribute to the formation of contrails. These white clouds left in the sky by aircraft may add to climate change if they persist long enough.\n\n\"There are still doubts about the climate impact of hydrogen aviation,\" said Matteo Mirolo, a sustainable aviation expert at Breakthrough Energy, an organization founded by Bill Gates that is also investing in developing hydrogen aircraft.\n\n\"We still don't know exactly the non-CO2 impact of hydrogen,\" said Mirolo, adding that hydrogen-powered aircraft would, however, have \"a positive impact, reducing pollution levels compared to fossil kerosene-powered aircraft, including particulate matter.\"\n\nT&E's L\u00f3pez de la Osa argues that cleaner-burning hydrogen engines mean contrails are likely to be short-lived. \"Hydrogen combustion emits fewer particles where water vapor can attach,\" he said.\n\nTo test that, Airbus is running a head-to-head comparison in Nevada by flying similar hydrogen and kerosene airplanes.\n\nThe aim is to \"generate data to understand the differences, via flight testing in environments where contrails would form,\" said Glenn Llewellyn, vice president of Airbus' zero-emissions aircraft program. Results are expected by the end of 2024.\n\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC. Copyright 2024.

The transformation of Namibia's economy and the realization of green hydrogen in the country were spearheaded by Dr Geingob.\n\nDrawing on the proverb that states \"Rome was not built in a day,\" it serves as a reminder that significant and great accomplishments require time and work. Success in any endeavour demands years of patience, perseverance, and long-term thinking. Thus, it is only fair that we revisit Geingob's role in the economic governance of Namibia, particularly some of the economic policies and programmes that laid the foundation for continued economic growth.\n\nAlthough some of the critics and economic analysts, over the years, have downplayed the realization of green hydrogen on the country's overall development, President Geingob leveraged his personal qualities and principles of integrity, accountability and service to champion the implementation of those economic reforms. His economic strategy has been the identification of poverty reduction as an overarching objective to ensure macroeconomic stability, which is crucial for ensuring sustainable economic growth. Therefore, it is worthy to note that the economic policies and reforms rolled out by the former President saw progress in poverty reduction and employment creation.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the transition to a carbon neutral environment, it is evident that there is political and ideological pressure to make hydrogen a vital part of the energy mix. As a result, green hydrogen has the potential to contribute to these efforts by displacing carbon-intensive fuels throughout the economy and resulting in significant emission reductions.\n\nThe economy will benefit greatly from the establishment of a reliable domestic energy supply, which will also lower imports from nearby nations. Notably, the development of a domestic green hydrogen market will spur the formation of numerous domestic businesses and generate thousands of jobs for the local population in every industry along the value chain. The aforementioned development has positioned Namibia to enhance clean energy and fulfill the most important directive of COP26. Member nations decided to focus on the tougher 1.5C aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, realizing that the 2C target would allow massive destruction to occur.\n\nThis development will not only benefit Namibia but support the research that since the Paris Agreement was signed, has shown a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels which would cause changes to the climate system that would be, in many cases, catastrophic. Some of them would be irreversible, so switching the focus to a 1.5C goal represents vital progress. Hence, the COP27 emphasis on climate finance, adaptation, and loss and damage, as issues of vital importance to developing nations. The energy crisis and economic woes of the past year could even make COP27 a turning point to clean energy and lower carbon emissions. Namibia has world class conditions for generating renewable electricity through solar and wind power, which are key drivers to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen. To exploit and benefit from this potential, the Namibian Government has high ambitions for both building large scale solar and wind farms and producing green energy carriers and raw materials.\n\nMoreover, we should acknowledge what is already being achieved in our country and take a pragmatic and realistic view of what can feasibly be achieved in the short, medium and long term. The road to a green hydrogen economy will not be an easy one as future demand and the structure of the market remain uncertain. To reach net zero emissions will require significant investment in current and new clean technologies, and away from fossil fuels.\n\nAgainst this background, to realize the true potential of hydrogen locally and to capture the benefits, policy support mechanisms are essential for the penetration of green hydrogen into multiple sectors and to encourage sector coupling. I view green hydrogen as the path forward to full decarbonization in a way that is reliable. It is important to note that green hydrogen can create more space for renewables by driving electrolysis with energy that would otherwise be curtailed. These renewable resources have the potential not only to meet Namibia's domestic energy needs but also to position Namibia as a major exporter of clean energy and goods exhibiting high local content.\n\nIt is my belief that a green economy can only be achieved through the commitment and actions of multiple sectors and stakeholders in society including government, business and individuals. Decisions at these levels have the potential to transform local and regional economies, while having a pronounced impact on the way in which communities and individuals live within society. In addition a range of enabling conditions, strategic priorities and policy reforms will be required for the redirection of investments and the reconfiguration of infrastructure to support a green hydrogen economy.\n\nNamibia should give green hydrogen top priority as a possible decarbonization solution to support these ongoing initiatives. Green hydrogen has the potential to enhance the standard of living for all residents by generating jobs, boosting foreign direct investment, and assisting the nation in achieving its sustainability goals. Along with increasing energy self-sufficiency, increased energy generation will result in surplus energy that can be exported to neighbouring countries.\n\nIn light of the future prospects that green hydrogen holds for Namibia, genuine action is necessary to ensure that the nation fully takes advantage of these opportunities. For green hydrogen projects to maximize benefits and minimize negative effects on local communities, good corporate governance, community engagement, and transparent practices are critical. To ensure that the government will act to address high-level dishonesty and the potential risk of conflicts of interest, appropriate policy frameworks are required. Avoiding this at all costs is advised.\n\nTo conclude, we are reminded of the great responsibility we have to uphold the vision and continue the work of His Excellency Dr. Hage G. Geingob as we continue his work. As a vital element of a future energy system based on sustainable practices, green hydrogen has enormous potential.\n\nAs His Excellency's vision states, the creation and application of green hydrogen has the potential to greatly improve energy security, promote economic expansion, and decarbonize a number of industries.", "source": {"uri": "economist.com.na", "dataType": "news", "title": "Namibia Economist"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josef_sheehama@economist.com.na", "name": "Josef Sheehama", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_reduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poverty reduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_mix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy mix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emission intensity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

They will review the move in 2026 after making a formal decision on what role, if any, they expect hydrogen to play compared with alternative low carbon heating options, such as electric heat pumps.\n\nThe government said it believed \"low carbon hydrogen may have a role to play in heat decarbonisation, alongside heat pumps and heat networks, but in slower time in some locations\".\n\nHowever, Martin Callanan, a minister in the energy department, added on X: \"Heat pumps and heat networks will be the main route to cutting household emissions for the foreseeable future\".\n\nJan Rosenow, programme director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, a non-governmental organisation, said: \"I think you can read between the lines that this is yet another step towards a decision that will not be in favour of the widespread use of hydrogen for home heating.\"\n\nThe decision to stop work on the project comes after the government had to abandon two smaller-scale hydrogen heating trials last year amid local opposition and limited availability of the gas.\n\nCutting emissions from home heating is one of the biggest challenges facing the government as it tries to meet its legally binding goal of cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Domestic boilers account for about 14 per cent of the country's carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe prospect of using hydrogen to heat people's homes has been controversial, with critics arguing the process is highly inefficient compared with heat pumps, which run on electricity to draw warmth from the outside air.\n\nLast year, the National Infrastructure Commission, the UK's top infrastructure adviser, urged the government to rule out supporting hydrogen and focus on subsidising heat pumps instead.\n\nNick Winser, NIC commissioner, said hydrogen was \"simply not ready at scale\". The gas is produced by splitting it from methane or from water, both of which are energy intensive and costly.\n\nOne trial is still due to go ahead in Fife, Scotland, supplying about 300 homes in its first phase.

It is the latter that is considered the main guarantee of the further decarbonization of the transport and heavy industry sectors.\n\nAccording to the forecasts, the demand for \"clean\" hydrogen will reach 170 million tons by 2030 and 600 million tons by 2050.\n\nIt is anticipated that by 2050, ferrous metallurgy, chemical and cement industries, energy will consume 42 percent of the total volume of \"clean\" hydrogen, and aviation, shipping and freight vehicles will consume 36 percent.\n\nThe European Commission announced that, already this year, the EU plans to start mass industrial use of \"clean\" hydrogen.\n\nThe launch of the \"hydrogen\" projects is facilitated by government support programs for private companies, which will continue until the production of \"clean\" hydrogen is comparable in cost to traditional hydrogen.\n\nDecarbonization and European integration of Ukraine\n\nUkraine pledged to continue reducing carbon emissions as a part of its European integration course.\n\nSince Ukraine no longer relies on Russian natural gas and oil, hydrogen usage in transportation, industry, and power generation remains its sole option.\n\nHowever, so far, governmental initiatives in Ukraine are limited to declarative statements about producing \"green\" steel.\n\nThe metallurgical industry seems promising for hydrogen production, considering the available power generation capacities of nuclear power plants in Ukraine.\n\nProvided international funds invest in the Ukrainian gas transportation system to modernize the existing pipeline network and improve the hydrogen storage capacities, the technology of direct recovery of iron and hydrogen technologies of steel production can be implemented in Ukraine.\n\nYet another element of increasing the economic effect of the use of hydrogen is the construction of up to 10 GW of electrolyzer capacities in Ukraine, which was foreseen in the EU Hydrogen Strategy.\n\nIn 2024, the Ukrainian government plans to approve the Hydrogen Strategy of Ukraine for the period until 2050 and to approve its implementation plan as soon as June.\n\nThe strategy will center on three fundamental aspects of hydrogen energy: generation, transportation, and storage.\n\nIf we channel our efforts into its implementation, we have every chance of becoming an important player in the international arena.\n\nOpenness and transparency of intentions between the EU and Ukraine, backed by reasoned calculations, will determine whether Ukraine will become the key to enhancing the \"green\" competitiveness of Europe.",

The cylinder technology, a culmination of several years of development and investment, operates under a unique special permit issued by the U.S. Department of Transport for use on roads.\n\nWhile OneH2 has been operating fleets of 520 bar hydrogen transport trailers for materials handling applications, this new 931 bar design allows for direct fills of higher-pressure, 700 bar automotive and heavy vehicle applications, making hydrogen-fueled transport much more economical.\n\nBy transporting hydrogen gas at higher pressures, OneH2 bypasses the extra processing normally required by delivery methods such as lower-pressure gaseous transport, requires further compression at the point of use; and in the case of liquid hydrogen, post-delivery processing often includes several stages of vaporization and compression before the hydrogen is usable as a transport fuel. All these processes add cost, time, and can impact reliability. When factored into the price of the fuel, this can be significant, especially at scale.\n\nNishanth Gorukanti, General Manager Operations & Maintenance for OneH2, said of the technology:\n\n\"OneH2 is very excited to launch the 931 bar high-pressure tube trailers in the market. This system design will help to store larger quantities of gaseous hydrogen for transportation, thereby avoiding any use of onboard compression on the trailer or compression systems at the retail point of use. OneH2's product development team, along with our partners, have put a lot of effort into designing the system and providing the market with a safe, reliable, and efficient system.\"\n\n931 bar trailers consist of various combinations of high-pressure cylinders packaged together. Each cylinder can hold up to 27 kg (gross) of gaseous hydrogen at 931 bar pressure, which is close to three times that of the cylinder technology OneH2 previously used.\n\nTrailers can be configured with various capacities. With a maximum configuration of up to 18 cylinders, a single trailer can hold up to 486 kg of automotive, fuel-cell grade, hydrogen. If on-site space is an issue, OneH2 offers smaller trailer configurations (down to 6 cylinders, 160kg) promoting better maneuverability in tighter environments.\n\nTo ensure maximum utilization of onboard hydrogen, OneH2 uses a patented cascading function, allowing each cylinder to act as its own cascading bank. Cascading is a method of intelligently drawing from different cylinders, to refuel the vehicles in such a way that the remaining inaccessible hydrogen gas in storage cylinders is kept to a minimum.\n\nThe trailer also includes key features that optimize performance and safety, such as onboard hydrogen gas sensors, on-tank actuator valves for isolation, telemetry to report the status of the trailer on-road, safety interlocks, and a temperature and pressure relief device (TPRD) for each tank.\n\nThe trailer's cylinders are designed and tested in accordance with international standards that provide specifications for the design, construction, and testing of type IV composite cylinders.\n\nOneH2 also offers 931 bar Mobile Fuelers using the same cylinder technology. The refueler includes an onboarded dispensing system for both 350 bar and 700 bar pressure, turning the trailer into a portable fueling station.\n\nThis mobile and portable refueling station allows customers to receive hydrogen at any location and immediately refuel vehicles, with minimal to no investment in on-site equipment and reducing permitting and construction headaches.\n\nWith this technological breakthrough, OneH2 continues to advance efficient hydrogen solutions, enabling economically advantageous fueling infrastructure to meet the growing demand of hydrogen vehicles.\n\nAbout ONEH2: Based in Longview, NC, OneH2 is a leader in sustainable hydrogen solutions, providing holistic production, delivery, and monitoring for hydrogen fuel. OneH2 produces and delivers hydrogen fuel across the U.S. and maintains a growing network of on-site hydrogen generators. OneH2 offers scalable end-to-end hydrogen fuel solutions that enable emission-free workplaces, including hydrogen buy-back programs and custom configurations to suit each business's needs.", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreetInsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Compression (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cylinder (engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(vehicle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (vehicle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Paper", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longview,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Longview, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Longview, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Actuator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telemetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_cylinder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gas cylinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Composite material"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel_Cells", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel Cells", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

He spent 40 years in the oil and gas business, where he specialized in public policy and communications.\n\nIn May of last year, I wrote about how U.S. Treasury Department's then-proposed rules for the hydrogen production tax credit (Internal Revenue Code Section 45V) could impact the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) power-plant rules.\n\nWhile low greenhouse-gas (GHG) hydrogen was listed as a key technology to decarbonize power-related emissions at the time, EPA reversed course this year, removing the technology from its final rule released late last month. (RELATED: DAVID BLACKMON: Market Realities Are Throwing Wrench In Biden's Green Energy Dreams)\n\nHere's how the Houston Chronicle put it: \"And in a blow to clean hydrogen developers in Texas and beyond, the EPA dropped language encouraging power companies to burn hydrogen fuel at gas plants after pushback from power companies.\"\n\nThe reason for the pullback is obvious. The activist-driven draft rules that Treasury published in December make it extremely difficult and costly to qualify for the credit, which means hydrogen will not be produced at the volumes necessary to supply the need. Green hydrogen producers are required to source their power from new zero-emission sources and match their hydrogen production to the carbon-intensity of the grid on an hourly basis.\n\nMeanwhile, so-called \"blue\" hydrogen producers must use a national average to estimate upstream emissions, meaning there's no incentive to use the cleanest natural gas to produce hydrogen. Both are policies that will result in the same outcome: less clean hydrogen on the market and higher costs, all of which was completely foreseeable last May.\n\nIt is notable now that individual companies are speaking up and warning about cancelling planned investments. Last year it was all speculative, and activists dismissed industry warnings as just fearmongering. Well, now companies are clearly not playing around.\n\nHere are some examples of just a few big hydrogen investments that could be paused or cut entirely as a result of the unworkable rules:\n\nMark Klewpatinond, global business manager for hydrogen at Exxon Mobil, told the Houston Chronicle: \"If we're not able to differentiate natural gas production, it's highly unlikely Baytown would proceed. It needs to compete for capital against other projects we have.\"\n\nKathleen Barr\u00f3n, executive vice president and chief strategy officer for Constellation, told the BloombergNEF Summit held in New York City in mid-April that her company, which is already producing hydrogen using electricity from one of its nuclear power plants, will file for the 45V production tax credit despite the fact that the project does not meet the draft criteria. Barron said Constellation was prepared to \"visit with the courts to sort out whether the final guidance is consistent with the statute.\"\n\nAxios reported on May 6 that metals giant Fortescue's CEO Andrew Forrest says the company will cancel its own major investments in hydrogen unless significant changes to the Section 45V credit regulations are made. \"Projects we have across North America will stop\" without such changes being implemented, Forrest said.\n\nFortescue's array of hydrogen-related investments in the United States include a federally subsidized plant in Washington state, another plant in Arizona and a car manufacturing site in Michigan. All are now in jeopardy.\n\nThese announcements by major companies seeking to commit billions to new hydrogen-related projects if the rules make sense fly in the face of a claim by left-wing activist group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) that industry complaints that the regulations as written \"will hinder industry growth consistently flout on the ground evidence and are contrary to the best analytical findings.\"\n\nRegardless of what \"analytical findings\" NRDC was relying on, the evidence on the ground as of today is clear: The Treasury interpretation as it currently exists will kill billions of dollars in job-creating investments in the United States, exactly as so many warned a year ago.\n\nIn an article published on its website last year, NRDC asserted there is \"no tradeoff between scaling up the industry and safeguarding against emissions increases,\" and that projects \"can be cost-competitive from day one\" under the rules they supported (and which Treasury adopted). But obviously, such a tradeoff does exist and the companies willing to risk billions of dollars on U.S. hydrogen development are not going to move ahead with such investments under a set of regulations that renders their projects non-profitable.\n\nCorporations exist for one reason: To generate profits for their investors. They are not charitable organizations and no amount of high-minded rhetoric and wishful thinking from the climate-alarm lobby can alter that reality.\n\nDavid Blackmon is an energy writer and consultant based in Texas.

This announcement was nestled in between publications of monthly energy trends data.\n\nHydrogen \"may have a role to play in heat decarbonisation\", DESNZ's short statement reads. But it will be limited to \"some locations\" and will be rolled out across a longer time period than initially expected.\n\nMinisters had hoped to undertake hydrogen trials at ever-increasing scales, from neighbourhood, to village, to town, before taking its strategic decision in 2026.\n\nNeighbourhood trials are set to begin in Fife next year after delays, and are already underway in several locations in mainland Europe. SGN is leading the Fife project and has attributed delays to supply chain challenges.\n\nHowever, both of the UK's hydrogen village trials have been mothballed due to staunch opposition from local residents. The first, in Whitby, was axed last summer. The other, in Redcar, was abandoned in December.\n\nThe town pilot would have seen hydrogen used as a replacement for natural gas in up to 10,000 homes. A location had not been firmed up but four gas distribution network submitted applications for government funding under the scheme, floating locations in Chester, Humberside, Hull, East Riding, Leeds and Teesside.\n\nToday's news will come as a blow to gas distribution networks that have been campaigning for the UK Government to ensure that hydrogen has a key role to play in decarbonising the nation's heating systems. Their argument is that, in doing so, gas infrastructure can continue to be used.\n\nHowever, amid both protests and a growing body of research on the potentially limited emissions and cost benefits of hydrogen over heat pumps, Ministers are facing calls not to place all their bets on hydrogen.\n\nCalls to action of this nature have been made by bodies including the National Infrastructure Commission, Citizen's Advice, the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee and E3G.\n\nThe Government's own climate advisors have stated that, regardless of what decisions are made for the end-use of hydrogen, current progress to roll out electric heat pumps and connected heat networks is far too slow.\n\nRelated news: UK falling behind in global hydrogen race, report warns", "source":

The Argyll Hydrogen Hub has the potential to enable the transition away from fossil-fuels to zero-carbon fuels for ferries, HGVs, buses, trains, industrial processes, and heating in the region. GreenPower is also actively considering the potential for hydrogen production at its other energy generation sites, including at the proposed Barachander Wind Farm, the sister project to Carraig Gheal.\n\nPaul Minto, Director of Green Hydrogen at GreenPower, said: \"It is an exciting time for the new hydrogen market in UK and with this planning consent for the Argyll Hydrogen Hub we are putting Oban and the region on the UK green hydrogen map.\n\n\"Green hydrogen is an important zero-carbon fuel that can help meet climate obligations while delivering sustainable fuel for a wide range of purposes. In Argyll there are several sectors currently dependent on fossil fuels where fuel-switching could radically reduce carbon emissions, and where jobs can be created through local production and use of green hydrogen. We expect our green hydrogen facility to begin production by the end of 2025, and we welcome all potential users to contact us to discuss supply options.\n\n\"There is significant potential to decarbonise the transport sector including buses and coaches, HGVs serving distilleries, fish farms, forestry operations, refuse collection vehicles, and with a longer-term opportunity to fuel ferries, planes and trains. Green hydrogen could also replace carbon-intensive fuels such as heating oil and LNG used in hospitals, leisure centres, care homes and industrial operations.\"\n\nRob Forrest, GreenPower CEO said: \"As a company rooted in Scotland we already have renewable energy facilities in Argyll, and we are delighted with this approval which means we can take further steps in the region to create clean, green jobs and more economic development. We can see a future where all heavy road transport and shipping is powered by green hydrogen, and where any industry using heating oils or gas can switch fuels to run on environmentally friendly green hydrogen.\"\n\n\"Argyll has all the ingredients for the creation of a clean, environmentally responsible, local energy system based on green hydrogen . This marks the beginning of significant growth and Argyll could become a green hydrogen hub for export to the rest of the country.\"\n\nRead the most up to date Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Industry news at FuelCellsWorks", "source": {"uri": "fuelcellsworks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FuelCellsWorks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argyll"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Argyll"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oban", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_processes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Industrial processes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll_and_Bute", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argyll and Bute"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Argyll and Bute"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis of water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_goods_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large goods vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emission intensity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fish farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heating oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Road transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_collection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waste collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://img.fuelcellsworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GreenPowers-Argyll-Hydrogen-Hub-Gets-Green-Light-1024x514.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

PosHYdon is teaching us a lot about the next steps that need to be taken towards safe, large-scale green hydrogen production from wind at sea. Offshore green hydrogen production will enable large-scale wind farms to be developed far out at sea. Wind energy is directly converted to green hydrogen from demineralized seawater and can be transported through the existing or new gas infrastructure.\n\nAs a result, offshore wind projects can be realized faster at significantly lower costs for society.

(also watch attached Creamer Media video.)\n\n\"It's an existing market today. There's a tremendous amount of grey hydrogen that is produced on the market, and we ultimately, at a minimum, need to decarbonise that hydrogen production,\" said Eggers.\n\n\"Today, that hydrogen production is used in oil refineries, and some other emerging applications.\n\n\"In the future, it's going to be used in aviation fuels, steel production, transportation and other verticals.\n\n\"Based on what I see today, we have a very robust pipeline. We continue to see a lot of interesting technologies, and a lot of countries remain committed to the original hydrogen strategies and agendas.\n\n\"That said, we can't hide away from the fact that the last year has been a little bit more challenging for the transition.\n\n\"Interest rates have been higher. There's general concern around politics and there's multiple wars in the Middle East and Europe.\n\n\"All that has provided a little sense of caution. If I look back to two or three years ago, we're certainly in a slightly more cautious perspective. That's not a bad thing.\n\n\"We want to see sensible investment investments made. We want to scale the most interesting and relevant technology.\n\n\"We don't want to see the wrong technologies get funded. To the extent that that's causing people to be a bit more thoughtful and mindful about what gets funded, I'm all for that,\" added Eggers.\n\nSOUTH AFRICAN COMPANIES INCUBATED\n\nMeanwhile, in South Africa, AP Ventures has incubated two entities, which the venture capital company is using as a tool to develop new projects and opportunities in South Africa. The two entities are MatiTech, water technology start-up, and African Hydrogen Ventures.\n\n\"We're seeking co-investors into both those entities and we want to have a meaningful impact on the development of the hydrogen economy in South Africa.\n\n\"We're very grateful for the support we've received from Anglo American, Impala Platinum and the Public Investment Corporation, three very supportive LPs, who share the strategic ambition of ours to develop hydrogen projects and opportunities globally in terms of the meaningful impact that should have and will have on platinum group metals but also domestically in terms of the opportunity within South Africa, which has abundant wind and solar renewable energy resources.\n\n\"The production of green hydrogen relies electrons from those renewable sources. That provides us with an interesting starting framework, and then we've got expertise in South Africa so we do continue to think that from our mining and extractive industries, companies such as Sasol etc., there's lots of existing infrastructure and expertise to leverage, and we're seeking to do most of that investment through MatiTech and African Hydrogen Ventures,\" said Eggers.\n\nMining Weekly can report that MatiTech is leveraging the technology of one of AP Ventures' existing Danish portfolio companies, which has developed technology to synthesise hydrogen peroxide in a continuous form and in low concentration, which enables its use in the elevation of water to potable status.\n\n\"It removes waterborne pathogens to enable safe drinking water for communities, schools, and the like. What we did is we incubated a business about three years ago. We had to find a team to lead that including various board members and CEO, which we've done, and the company has made great strides.\n\n\"Their most significant installation is a project on an operational mine site in South Africa where they are treating the water and have installed the hydrogen peroxide technology along with significant peripheral equipment, which actually now enables safe water.\n\n\"This has been independently validated in the market by an external group, so we know that the water is continuously being safe and we're now providing that water to the community,\" said Eggers, who is hoping to see many more opportunities to make local use of hydrogen peroxide.\n\nWith the applications being broad, early conversations are under way with vineyards looking to treat their water.\n\nThrough the Danish company, a trial has already taken place in Napa Valley, in the US, which is being leveraged to find local applications in South Africa's Western Cape.\n\nA series of commercial sales in the agricultural space has taken place across South Africa, taking in George, in the southern Cape, as well as North West province.\n\nEggers' view is that the PGMs-linked hydrogen peroxide technology is going to have a profound impact for years to come in South Africa in the water context.\n\nConcurrently, African Hydrogen Ventures has been set up to develop hydrogen related projects with partners in South Africa.\n\nBeing leveraged is some of the technology in which AP Ventures has invested in North America and Europe for application in the South African context.\n\nIn addition, own projects being developed are in dual fuel applications, involving the use of hydrogen in internal combustion for mobility applications, as well as electrolyser assembly and a wide variety of other initiatives, that make use of existing technology and know-how from the other 26 portfolio companies in which AP Ventures has invested.\n\nEighty per cent of AP Venture has gone into the northern hemisphere, with only 20% going into southern hemisphere countries that include Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, reflecting where the venture capital company sees most of the innovation coming forward.\n\nDECARBONISATION FOCUS\n\nThe portfolio is centres on particularly hydrogen's role in decarbonising energy and industry.\n\nSince 2013, its investments have gone into technologies to unlock the hydrogen value chain, enabling the global transition to sustainable energy.\n\nInvestments are in hydrogen production, storage, and transportation as well as hydrogen applications that address the structural constraints affecting mining, transportation and heavy industry.\n\nTargeted are early stage technology companies with a global mandate that address the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOwing to hydrogen being a zero carbon emission energy carrier, its value chain is growing with established applications in many industries.\n\nThe high-performance characteristics of PGMs play a key role in the proton exchange membrane or PEM electrolysers that generate green hydrogen.", "source": {"uri": "miningweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mining

This is the manufacturer's most popular hydrogen model - over 200 buses of this type are in operation across 10 European countries, including Bolzano and Venice, Italy. Furthermore, the company has an order portfolio for an additional 600 vehicles, to be delivered between 2024 and 2025.\n\nSolaris is a leading European manufacturer of zero-emission buses. In the area of hydrogen buses, the manufacturer is the undisputed leader of the European market, holding nearly half of the market share in this segment.\n\nThe Solaris Urbino 12 hydrogen is powered by electricity generated by the latest hydrogen fuel cell technology. The vehicle is equipped with composite hydrogen tanks on the roof, capable of holding 37.5 kg of hydrogen. When fully fueled, the bus can travel up to 600 km (according to the e-SORT 2 test). The showcased vehicle is equipped with CO2 air conditioning with a heat pump, as well as ADAS features such as MirrorEye and Mobileye Shield+.\n\nRead the most up to date Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Industry news at FuelCellsWorks", "source": {"uri": "fuelcellsworks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FuelCellsWorks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Solaris", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Solaris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbino", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Urbino"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Urbino"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Bus_&_Coach", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solaris Bus & Coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bolzano"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bolzano"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Urbino_12", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solaris Urbino 12"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Composite material"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Bus", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Bus", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel_Cells", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel Cells", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://img.fuelcellsworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-09_07-48-49-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "dateEnd": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 69, "textEnd": 77}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Activate your Online Access Now\n\nGreen hydrogen is currently much more expensive than the alternative that's made from polluting fossil fuels, hindering its adoption. But investment is ramping up to try and close that gap, with governments around the world providing hefty subsidies to incentivize its production. Spending on electrolyzers more than tripled last year to $8.7 billion, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nHydrogen, a key input in making ammonia and refining oil, is today mostly made with fossil fuel. That resulted in some 900 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2022, according to the IEA. Using renewable electricity to produce the gas, which only produces water when burned, can make it more climate friendly. So-called green hydrogen could potentially displace natural gas and coal in other heavy-emitting processes like steel production, shipping and power storage that have few alternatives to lower emissions.\n\nTo understand Hysata's technology, it helps to look inside an electrolyzer. The machines apply electricity to water and split the compound into its constituent elements of hydrogen and oxygen. It's quite easy to make an electrolyzer at home that generates small quantities of hydrogen. All you need is two pieces of solid metal, some wire, salty water and a source of electricity.", "source": {"uri": "financialpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steelmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The iron bird is a functional analogue of the powertrain that Universal Hydrogen has been flight testing since March 2023. The company's liquid hydrogen module holds fuel to power the iron bird for over three hours at full power, with two such modules sufficient for 500 nautical miles of usable range (on top of reserves) for an ATR72 regional airliner. This demonstration, conducted at the Mojave Air & Space Port, is the first time the company's module and powertrain have been integrated together, marking another significant accomplishment on the path toward entry into passenger service planned for 2026.\n\nDeveloped at Universal Hydrogen's engineering and design center in Toulouse, France, the liquid hydrogen module is the core of the company's fuel services offering for aviation. It internalizes all the complexity of managing cryogenic hydrogen, while externally presenting a simple container interface compatible with existing intermodal freight and airport cargo handling equipment. The module contains ~200 kilograms of liquid hydrogen and is capable of storing it for long durations without boiloff. The module contains systems to convert cryogenic liquid hydrogen into warm gaseous hydrogen that is consumed by the powertrain. It also incorporates features such as hydrogen leak detection and venting systems for safe operations, as well as a leak-proof quick-connect for easy installation and removal of the module from the aircraft.\n\n\"This end-to-end demonstration of a hydrogen molecule moving from our filler/dispenser into our storage module and then into our powertrain is the first time that all the pieces of our product portfolio for regional aviation have come together,\" said Paul Eremenko, co-founder and CEO of Universal Hydrogen. \"The next step is to upgrade our flight testbed to fly the powertrain fueled by our modules.\"\n\nToday's demonstration comes on the heels of Universal Hydrogen's demo in recent weeks of another use case for its modular fueling technology, a hydrogen-powered charger for airport ground support equipment. The company also recently announced the hire of Stasy Pasterick as Chief Financial Officer.\n\nUniversal Hydrogen is a hydrogen fuel services provider that uses unique liquid and gaseous hydrogen module technology. The company takes a flexible, scalable, and capital-light approach to hydrogen logistics by transporting it in modular capsules over the existing freight network from green production sites directly to point of consumption, anywhere in the world. The company is targeting regional and narrowbody/single aisle airplanes as the most impactful decarbonization opportunities, while seeking other early applications that can make a difference. Universal Hydrogen is also working to certify a powertrain conversion kit to retrofit existing regional aircraft to fly on hydrogen.\n\nRead the most up to date Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Industry news at FuelCellsWorks", "source": {"uri": "fuelcellsworks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FuelCellsWorks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Universal Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Modular design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Regional airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modularity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryogenics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Air_and_Space_Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mojave Air and Space Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATR_72", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATR 72"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_freight_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intermodal freight transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intermodal container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nautical mile"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Eremenko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Eremenko"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel_Cells", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel Cells", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://img.fuelcellsworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-02-27_11-34-47-1024x572.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Marubeni's 2030 target of 3 million-5 million mt/year clean ammonia refers to both renewable and low-carbon fuels.\n\nMarubeni is also aiming to produce 160,000 mt/year sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. It will also add four-to-five new CCUS projects, Wataru, who earlier looked after the conventional power business of Marubeni, said.\n\n\"The phase-one period of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation has begun from this year, and we are aware that some countries and regions are moving to impose mandates of SAF use on the fuel and aviation industries with a target year of 2030,\" Wataru said.\n\n\"To meet those 2030 targets, production projects will be expected to be launched in the next few years, and we believe the market will expand accordingly.\"\n\nWith high costs of producing renewable hydrogen owing to rising cost of electrolyzers, labor and materials, it is getting more difficult for the clean energy industry sponsors to make a decision on final investment, Wataru said.\n\n\"Energy cost is going down but it is still higher than what we expect,\" he said. However, \"gradually all the prices will go down.\"\n\nOne positive development that may lead to a fall in prices is that the small, locally produced, locally consumed hydrogen projects are progressing and would create demand for electrolyzers.\n\nAs for the benchmark $2/kg for renewable hydrogen, specifically targeted by Australia, Wataru said, it is a \"very challenging production cost.\"\n\nPlatts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed Queensland hydrogen produced via alkaline electrolysis (including capex) at $4/kg May 6, down 16.3% month on month.\n\nIt assessed Japan hydrogen produced via alkaline electrolysis (including capex) at $4.95/kg May 7, up 0.4% from a month ago.\n\nMarubeni is scheduled to make a demonstration shipment of renewable hydrogen via metal hydrides from its South Australia renewable hydrogen project to Indonesia. In Jakarta, it will be converted to power and heat using fuel cells in an industrial park.\n\nThe \"shipment can be made over this summer -- June, or going up, till August -- depending on the progress of the project,\" Wataru said, noting that such a shipment may be a first for Asia Pacific.\n\nMetal hydrides have hydrogen bonded to them where the metal absorbs hydrogen through cooling and pressurizing and discharges hydrogen through heating and decompression. These are put in a container and placed on a ship, so a special vessel is not needed, making storage and delivery easy.\n\nAfter this demonstration, the renewable hydrogen will be supplied to gas-fired plants in South Australia.\n\nIn 2022 Marubeni was involved in the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) project in Australia which shipped the world's first liquid hydrogen cargo on the Suiso Frontier demonstration tanker that traveled from Australia's Victoria to Kobe in Japan.\n\nWataru said both the technologies involved high costs, but, development is needed all across in order to progress the hydrogen industry.\n\n\"I cannot exclude any technology at this moment [just] because all the systems are very expensive,\" Wataru said. \"If many people purchase those [fuels produced by different technologies] then the price will go down.\"\n\nMarubeni is developing CCS/CCUS projects in countries where regulations for carbon tax, subsidy and carbon tax credit are advanced such as the US, Canada, the UK and Australia, Wataru said.\n\n\"We are going to put some more dots on the map for CCUS [new projects],\" he said. \"We have four or five projects in the pipeline for CCUS.\"\n\nThe company is betting big on carbon capture, because without it net zero by 2050 cannot be achieved, Wataru said.", "source": {"uri": "spglobal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "spglobal.com"},

With the delivery of important core components, a milestone has been reached on the way to completing the system. In the presence of the mayor of Frankenthal, Dr. The project partners have now presented the construction progress of the new H2 filling station in Frankenthal to Nicolas Meyer. Commissioning is planned for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nA public hydrogen filling station is being built next to the BASF factory site in the Frankenthal district. In the future, cars and light commercial vehicles (700 bar) as well as trucks and buses (350 bar) will be able to refuel here. The heart of the gas station is the compressor and two medium and high pressure storage tanks, which were delivered this week. Until the planned opening at the end of 2024, the technical components of the system will be prepared for public use in a commissioning process lasting several months, including refueling tests.\n\n\"The construction of the hydrogen filling station in Frankenthal is an important component of the mobility and climate change for our city. I am pleased that this project will also make the hydrogen filling station available to the citizens of Frankenthal and the surrounding area. This hydrogen filling station is also an important pin on the logistics map for our business location,\" said Mayor of Frankenthal Dr. Nicholas Meyer.\n\nFor the first expansion stage, a daily capacity of 700 to 800 kilograms of hydrogen is planned, which corresponds to more than 30 trucks or buses. H2 MOBILITY, the builder and operator of the gas station, plans to double capacity in a second expansion stage by 2027. \"Demand for heavy-duty transport will also increase significantly in this region. That's why we're building new locations like the one in Frankenthal that are many times larger than they were a few years ago. In the future, up to three vehicles will be able to refuel here at the same time, including buses and trucks with 350 bar as well as light commercial vehicles and cars with 700 bar. We are pleased to soon be putting a state-of-the-art, efficient gas station of this size into operation in Rhineland-Palatinate,\" said Martin J\u00fcngel, Managing Director and CFO of H2 MOBILITY Germany .\n\nAs part of the project, BASF will invest proportionately in the planned 350 bar module. The company's goal is to help initiate a cross-sector hydrogen economy in the region. \"CO2-free hydrogen is an integral part of our energy transformation at the Ludwigshafen site,\" emphasizes Tilmann Hezel, Senior Vice President Infrastructure at the BASF Ludwigshafen site. \"At the same time, hydrogen and a sufficient H2 infrastructure are fundamental for a change towards alternative drives. We want to use this intersection: With projects such as the H2 filling station, but also the water electrolyser currently under construction, we want to support regional mobility as well as our suppliers and transport companies at the location in switching to vehicles with fuel cell drives.\"\n\nDue to its location on the A6 via the Ludwigshafen Nord junction, the filling station is strategically well located and easy to access for logistics traffic in Rhineland-Palatinate and the cross-border region. The gas station also forms an important redundancy for the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region, where three more H2 MOBILITY gas stations of similar size and performance will be built by 2026.\n\nDr. Doris Wittneben, Head of Future Fields and Innovation Metropolregion Rhein-Neckar GmbH : \"We are pleased that the hydrogen filling station in Frankenthal is another important component of the hydrogen ecosystem in the Rhine-Neckar region. The Frankenthal hydrogen filling station is part of the H2Rivers project, which the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region coordinates as part of the federal government's HYLAND funding framework. From the production of climate-friendly hydrogen through renewable energies, to a new filling station infrastructure, to the use of fuel cell technology in public and municipal vehicles, the market readiness of hydrogen as an energy source is demonstrated.\"\n\nThe H2Rivers project paves the way for the nationwide market entry of emission-free hydrogen and fuel cell technologies in the mobility sector in the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region and the central Neckar area. The development of the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region as a hydrogen region is supported by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure as part of the National Innovation Program for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP2) with \u20ac20 million in investment grants. The hydrogen filling station in Frankenthal will receive \u20ac1,288,000 in funding. The funding guidelines are coordinated by NOW GmbH and implemented by the Project Management J\u00fclich (PtJ).\n\nCars and small commercial vehicles, including industrial trucks and garbage collectors, can currently refuel with hydrogen at 700 bar at over 80 public H2 MOBILITY filling stations. Four further 700 bar filling stations are being planned, constructed or commissioned. Refueling at 350 bar for trucks and buses is possible at 27 stations. 15 additional refueling options for 350 bar are being implemented. The network development takes place, among other things, along the TEN-T corridors and is always demand-oriented.\n\nH2 MOBILITY Germany is a pioneer in the development of a public hydrogen filling station network and Europe's largest operator of public hydrogen stations. The business areas include technical development, financing, planning, construction, marketing and operation of the stations. H2 MOBILITY Deutschland was founded in 2015 as a project company with the aim of promoting hydrogen as an emission-free fuel in road transport. In 2022, the project company became a long-term, economically oriented company with the aim of contributing to the energy transition in transport through a high-performance hydrogen filling station network. H2 MOBILITY Germany has set itself the goal of converting completely to renewable hydrogen by 2028.

Hydrogen has several applications, including storing energy and powering vehicles.\n\n\"Investors in green hydrogen and its derivatives may apply for areas where their projects are being developed to be designated as SEZ,\" say the guidelines, which took effect on May 1.\n\nThe government has established three public SEZs -- Dongo Kundu, Konza, and Naivasha -- and has licensed more than 15 private SEZs.\n\nFirms in the SEZs enjoy a 10-year tax holiday, exemption from import duty, excise duty, import declaration fee, value-added tax (VAT) exemption on imported goods, and zero-rated VAT for local supplies.\n\nThey also operate under a single licence, enjoy perpetual exemption of stamp duty, preferential rates for withholding tax at five percent on interest, management, and royalties, a 100 percent investment deduction allowance over 20 years, and access to special electricity tariffs.\n\nThe guidelines are part of Kenya's efforts to nurture the production of green hydrogen locally, which can be utilised for power generation, heating, transport and industries such as steel, chemical and refineries.\n\nAs part of this shift, Kenya unveiled its Green Hydrogen Strategy and Road Map during the Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi last September.\n\n\"Green hydrogen is recognised as a promising alternative for decarbonizing the transport, agricultural, and energy sectors,\" said Epra.\n\nThis was followed by the commissioning of the country's first green hydrogen plant in Morendat, Nakuru County that produces one tonne of green ammonia per day.\n\nThe facility comprises a 2.1 megawatt-peak (MWp) solar PV installation with 780 kilowatt-hours (kWh) Lithium-ion storage supplying a 1 megawatt (MW) alkaline electrolyzer.\n\nThe government aims to use the locally-produced green hydrogen to substitute 20 percent of imported ammonia-based fertilizer by 2027 which translates to about 100,000 tonnes annually.\n\nIt also seeks to substitute 100 percent of imported methanol, which translates to more than 5,000 tonnes annually, with local production during the same period.", "source": {"uri": "businessdailyafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BUSINESS DAILY AFRICA"},

But now hydrogen power and fuel-cell applications are scaling up faster in California than anywhere else in the U.S. as the state leads a national effort to convert diesel-powered trucks and stationary power to fuel cells.\n\nToyota is basing some 50 engineers and other specialty staff at the center to build out its capability for both vehicles and stationary power.\n\n\"We will continue to advance this scalable, zero-emission technology as part of our electrified portfolio,\" says Ted Ogawa, president and CEO, Toyota Motor North America. \"Renaming this facility as North American Hydrogen Headquarters represents our leadership in fuel-cell development creating real-world products to help reduce carbon emissions.\"\n\nThe company currently markets one fuel-cell car, the Mirai, which it sells in small numbers. One of the problems in scaling fuel-cell cars, even in California, has been a scarcity of hydrogen refueling stations and a steady, reliable supply of hydrogen to the stations that are in place.\n\nToyota has hydrogen stationary power at its own port operation in Long Beach, CA, working with Fuel Cell Energy, to build a \"clean\" hydrogen generating station, which produces hydrogen from biomass waste gas.\n\nThe Gardena facility already provided R&D assets, including Toyota's largest dynamometer (1.2 MW), a scalable test bench for stationary applications and a hydrogen fueling station capable of providing fuel for both light- and heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nStarting last year, most trucks and buses operating in California are required to be 2010 model year or newer to reduce particulate pollution and NOx emissions. And by 2036, the state will ban all internal combustion trucks.\n\nAdditionally, California is putting in a growing number of fuel-cell generators and production centers that can supply trucks and port power to cargo ships to curb emissions from diesel engines from the massive cargo industry in the state.

(NASDAQ: PLUG), announced it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Australian company, Allied Green Ammonia (AGA), which excels at producing green ammonia. The collaboration will see Plug Power supply as much as 3 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyzer capacity for a hydrogen to ammonia facility that AGA currently has in the works.\n\nThe hydrogen to green ammonia facility has been proposed for the Northern Territory of Australia, Gove Peninsula. Here, it can reportedly tap into abundant energy resources and strong energy infrastructure and is strategically aligned with Asia's trading partnerships.\n\nMore to the point, the location of the production facility is geographically positioned to meet the growing needs of Allied Green Ammonia's intended customers. It will supply these customers with a secure and reliable source of renewably produced ammonia from the region.\n\nAGA's upcoming hydrogen to ammonia plant will operate a 2500 metric ton-per-day (TPD) green ammonia process. According to a recent Plug Power news release, green hydrogen generated by Plug's electrolyzers can aid in decarbonizing the process of producing ammonia. This is achieved by displacing Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) techniques. The company's pressurized (40 bar) electrolyers also reduce downstream compression requirements. Moreover, due to the electrolyzers' high-temperature combustion capability, the extracted oxygen from electrolysis-based H2 can improve efficiency in furnaces and in industrial power plants.\n\n\"Ammonia producers have recognized the substantial advantages of cost and carbon reduction through electrolysis-based hydrogen,\" said Andy Marsh, Plug Power CEO.\n\nMarsh added that Plug's expertise in building and operating large-scale H2 production facilities and their PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capability makes them an ideal partner to support AGA's 3GW project. The 3GW electrolyzer supply is slated to begin delivery in the first quarter of 2027.\n\nGreen ammonia results from a process where ammonia is 100% renewable and carbon-free.

Whatever the reason for this trend - from execution of charging infrastructure to price - passenger cars powered by H2 simply haven't taken off. That said, Toyota believes that larger personal vehicles hold a substantial amount of promise.\n\nWhile automakers developed hydrogen fuel cells for the passenger vehicle market, the focus was on sedans and other cars, though not often on larger vehicle. Now, Toyota is seeing the potential trucks and pickups have in personal and commercial markets due to their power and range.\n\nToyota already has substantial interest and resources in this area, so if there is a company that could put H2-powered pickup trucks on roads around the world, it could be the one. The key is to make it commercially viable, something it has failed to do with H2 vehicles until this point.\n\nAccording to Toyota chief engineer for advanced mobility Jay Sackett, who was previously the Toyota Tundra pickup project engineer, hydrogen fuel cell technology \"offers a great opportunity for light-duty trucks. You could get to the same amount range for a truck that you would need a very large battery for.\"\n\nDuring an interview that took place at the automaker's North American H2 HQ, Sacket discussed the subject of hydrogen pickup trucks. There, group vice president Jordan Choby also talked about H2, discussing the way that the automaker's existing hydrogen tanks would fit perfectly in a hydrogen pickup truck about the size of the Tundra.\n\nHe added that they \"have a fuel cell Tundra in Japan that we use to tow our hydrogen internal combustion race car.\"\n\nSo far, despite the enthusiasm expressed by both Toyota execs, there has yet to be a decision officially made regarding the production of a new H2-powered vehicle, let alone hydrogen pickup trucks. Nothing has been announced to say that there are projects moving forward using those H2 tanks or in a vehicle the size of a Tundra.\n\nIt isn't difficult to see why the company sees opportunity in such a project. Fuel cell vehicles of that size tend to make more sense than those powered exclusively by electric batteries, due to issues with range when towing substantial weight. Moreover, the weight of the battery itself is also an impediment to that type of application.\n\nWhen pressurized hydrogen is on board for powering a fuel cell, the weighty battery in hydrogen pickup trucks would be substantially smaller. This would allow the range to be comparable to those of conventional fossil fuel combustion vehicles.\n\nAccording to Sacket, a fuel cell pickup truck is just what US consumers and businesses are looking for.\n\n\"Tundra owners like to tow. Truck owners also want the fast fueling. Hydrogen allows you to do that. You can pump it like gasoline,\" he explained.", "source": {"uri": "hydrogenfuelnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hydrogen Fuel News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julie_campbell@hydrogenfuelnews.com", "name": "Julie Campbell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Mirai", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Mirai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Nexo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Nexo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Tundra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Tundra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charging station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Hydrogen-pickup-trucks-RKP-Hydrogen-Hilux-053-Image-Source-Toyota.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549982", "eventUri": "eng-9549982", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

It still plans to make a decision in 2026 on whether hydrogen has a role to play in large-scale residential heating, according to a statement on Thursday from the government.\n\nRishi Sunak has been slammed by his climate advisers after softening parts of the UK's green agenda last year. The prime minister has argued the UK is overachieving on its green goals and can afford to slow down on renewable energy, efficient boilers and home insulation, but he's also been accused of trying to weaponize net zero ahead of elections this year.\n\nDecarbonizing home heating is one of the steepest hills the UK has to climb to reach net zero because the housing stock is warmed predominantly by gas and, in some cases, oil boilers. The country is also lagging behind other European nations in installing heat pumps.\n\nSome industry experts said consideration of hydrogen for home heating has been as a distraction, and welcomed the decision to shelve the pilot project.\n\n\"Today's decision makes clear that all attention and investment should be focused on readily available clean heat solutions, like heat pumps and heat networks,\" said Juliet Phillips, UK energy program lead at climate change think tank E3G.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

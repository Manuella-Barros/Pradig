Along with Beane's 10-player draft class, that puts the team's roster at 77 players. It's expected that another 12 rookie undrafted free agents will sign ahead of rookie minicamp this weekend, which would put the roster at 89, one short of the 90-man offseason limit. However, the Bills are permitted to go to 91 players because seventh-round draft choice Travis Clayton is part of the international player pathway program.\n\nPeople are also reading...

National analysts weigh in on Buffalo Bills' draft class Bills Mailbag: Which rookies can be immediate contributors? 'Cole is a dude:' Since high school, new Bills safety Bishop has been quick study\n\n\"We've got some guys, we've added some depth, we've added some competition, some pieces. We're not going to be at 90 by the end of this, so we're going to keep looking and see what's shuffled out over the next couple weeks - maybe some vets get released where they were drafted over by a team or two,\" Beane said. \"We're going to keep spinning this roster and see if there are a few pieces between now and camp.\n\n\"You're never happy. You're never, like, content, like we got it figured out.\"\n\n'Cole is a dude:' Since high school, new Bills safety Bishop has been quick study\n\nSince being forced into a starting role as a high school freshman in Georgia, new Bills safety Cole Bishop has proven to be a quick study.\n\nOne bonus of adding free agents now is that their additions no longer count in the compensatory draft pick formula for 2025. As it stands, the Bills are projected to receive fourth- and fifth-round compensatory picks next year for the losses of receiver Gabe Davis and edge rusher Leonard Floyd, according to the website Over The Cap, which diligently tracks the compensatory process.\n\nWhile Beane doesn't have a lot of money to go shopping at the moment, the Bills will open up a little more than $10 million in cap space when cornerback Tre'Davious White's money comes off the books after June 1. Here are 10 free agents still currently on the market, listed in alphabetical order, who could be of interest to Beane and the Bills:\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nK Randy Bullock: If the Bills want to bring veteran competition to camp for Tyler Bass, Bullock is still on the open market. Given that it would cost more to cut Bass than keep him on the team, however, this is unlikely.\n\nDL Calais Campbell: If the Bills feel like they need more leadership in the locker room, Campbell would immediately fill that void. He's made a previous visit to Buffalo as a free agent last year, so we know Beane at one point had an interest. A former Walter Payton Man of the Year winner, Campbell opted to sign with the Falcons for the 2023 season instead of the Bills. He went on to start every game in Atlanta, finishing with 56 tackles and 6.5 sacks, both his most since 2019. He turns 38 right before the start of the 2024 season, so it would clearly be a short-term deal, but Campbell showed last year he can still play.\n\nCB Stephon Gilmore: A former first-round draft pick of the Bills in 2012, Gilmore has entered the journeyman portion of his career, playing for four teams over the past four seasons. Although he'll turn 34 in September, Gilmore, like Campbell, played at a high level last season. For the Cowboys, he started all 17 games, making 13 passes defensed and two interceptions. He also set a career high with 68 tackles. It's possible Gilmore is holding out for a starting job somewhere, but if the Bills wanted to add veteran depth behind projected starters Christian Benford and Rasul Douglas, Gilmore would be more than just a reunion storyline.\n\nCB Xavien Howard: He was a first-team All-Pro in 2020 after leading the NFL with 20 passes defensed and 10 interceptions with Miami. He's made just two interceptions over the past two seasons, but has defended 24 passes in that time. The days of Howard being a No. 1 cornerback are likely over, but like Gilmore, he could provide veteran depth. Consider it a measure of revenge for the Dolphins signing Jordan Poyer.\n\nWR Zay Jones: The former Bills second-round draft pick was released recently by Jacksonville after the Jaguars drafted LSU wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. in the first round last month. Jones suffered a knee injury last season that limited him to just nine games. As a result, he finished with just 34 catches for 321 yards and two touchdowns. The previous year, however, he had 82 catches for 823 yards and five touchdowns - his most productive professional season. Receiver remains a worry spot for many fans, so it makes sense to include Jones here. He's reportedly taking a visit to the Titans, however, so even if the Bills were interested, they might not get the chance to sign him.\n\nDE Yannick Ngakoue: He's played for six teams over the past five seasons, so Ngakoue is no stranger to moving around. He finished with just four sacks in 13 games last year for the Bears, but over the 2021-22 seasons with the Raiders and Colts, respectively, Ngakoue had 19.5 sacks. The Bills did not invest heavily along the edge in the draft, so Ngakoue could be an option if the team is looking for a designated pass rusher.\n\nG Dalton Risner: The Bills are gambling that moving Connor McGovern from left guard to center to replace Mitch Morse will work out. They're also betting that David Edwards will capably step in for McGovern at left guard. Even if both moves work out, it leaves the Bills with less depth than a year ago. Risner started 11 games and appeared in 15 for the Vikings last year after spending the first four years of his career with the Broncos.\n\nWR Michael Thomas: He's appeared in just 20 games over the past four seasons because of various injuries, so being overly reliant on Thomas would be a bad decision for any team. But, as a low-risk flier to see if he could ever regain some of the form that four straight seasons of at least 1,100 receiving yards to start his NFL career ... that could be worth it for the 31-year-old.\n\nS Justin Simmons: The selection of Utah safety Cole Bishop in the second round lessens the need at the position, but Simmons would also immediately address the team's leadership void. He turns 31 in November and started 15 games for the Broncos last season, finishing with 70 tackles, eight passes defensed and three interceptions.\n\nWR Marquez Valdes-Scantling: It was Valdes-Scantling, and not Stefon Diggs, who was making big plays down the field when the Bills hosted the Chiefs in January in an AFC divisional playoff game. At the very least, Valdes-Scantling, 29, is big-game tested.\n\n0 Comments Tags Sports American Football Job Market Trade The Economy Games And Toys Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

What makes me want to go sit in front of the television for a few hours? It's somebody like that. He's phenomenal. He's fun to watch.\"\n\nBills at Lions\n\nTwo franchises still searching for their first Super Bowl win and two rabid, loyal fan bases. Throw in the fact that the Bills and the Lions played a thriller at Ford Field in Thanksgiving 2022 and this matchup makes sense for primetime.\n\nBills at Jets\n\nThe Jets have won the home meeting between these two teams each of the past two seasons. Last year, the September 11 season opener will always be remembered as the night Aaron Rodgers tore his Achilles. Is another Week 1 primetime battle, welcoming Rodgers back to the field, in the cards?\n\nDolphins at Bills\n\nThe Bills and Dolphins closed out the 2023 regular season on Sunday Night Football in a game that was undecided until late in the fourth quarter. Although it may not be what in was in the days of Jim Kelly and Dan Marino, the Bills-Fins rivalry is hot again and packs plenty of star power.\n\nBills at Texans\n\nIt's a matchup between 2023 division champions with a star quarterback on each side. Throw in the Stefon Diggs' factor and this year's meeting is a can't-miss affair.\n\nChiefs at Bills\n\nFrom here forward, the NFL is likely to give preferential treatment to every ensuing installment of the Mahomes vs. Allen rivalry. The Bills have won the last three regular season meetings between the two, but the Chiefs have directly eliminated Buffalo from the postseason three of the past four years.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ralph_ventre@si.com", "name": "Ralph Ventre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefon_Diggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefon Diggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sunday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Marino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Marino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_621/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx7frhyske22drty5j", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544143", "eventUri": "eng-9544143", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 266, "textEnd": 271}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-11", "textStart": 1344, "textEnd": 1356}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Buffalo wasn't done adding youth after the conclusion of the three-day extravaganza, as the team has reportedly agreed to contracts with several players who fell through the cracks of the seven-round event. Though every undrafted free agent signed is likely a longshot to make the roster given the Bills' depth, there are a few interesting names to keep track of. We've compiled a list of every reported Buffalo UDFA signing and what you need to know about them.\n\nNote: All UDFA signings are merely reported at this time. Though they've been announced by insiders, agencies, and schools, the Bills have not confirmed any of these signings.\n\nLikely the most recognizable name of Buffalo's reported 2024 undrafted free agent class, Frank Gore Jr. is, aptly, the son of legendary NFL running back Frank Gore, who spent the 2019 season as a key contributor for a Buffalo Bills offense helmed by a then-sophomore Josh Allen. Gore retired as the NFL's third-all-time leading rusher following the 2020 season, missing the opportunity to share an NFL field with his son by just a few years.\n\nGore Jr. isn't quite the power threat that his father was, but he is an elusive back who could make a push for the backend of Buffalo's depth chart at running back throughout the summer. He's coming off a collegiate career in which he rushed for 4,022 yards and 26 touchdowns, leaving Southern Mississippi as the program's third-all-time leading rusher.\n\nRelated: CBS Sports Ranks Bills' UDFA Signing of Frank Gore Jr. as One of NFL's Best\n\nBuffalo's defense loves to deploy players who have a nose for the football, and former Western Michigan defensive back Keni-H Lovely certainly fits the bill. He recorded six interceptions and four forced fumbles throughout his time at Western Michigan, this in addition to 108 total tackles and 10 pass deflections. The vast majority of his experience comes on the boundary, as 513 of his 646 defensive snaps in the 2023 season came out wide; the 5-foot-10 defender will compete with the likes of Ja'Marcus Ingram and Kyron Brown for a spot at the bottom of the Bills' depth chart at cornerback.\n\nTe'Cory Couch's path to a roster spot in Buffalo is as a depth nickel defender and special teamer. He primarily played in the slot at Miami, registering 482 snaps as a nickel cornerback last season. He recorded 153 tackles and four picks throughout his five seasons with the Hurricanes, also contributing on kick and punt returns as a blocker. His size (listed at 5-foot-10, 175 pounds on Miami's website) is a bit of a concern, but he brings a breadth of experience to the Bills; he'll compete with 2024 sixth-round pick Daequan Hardy for the team's backup nickel spot in training camp and preseason.\n\nA three-year starter for Utah, the aptly named Keaton Bills was a reliable, if not unspectacular guard throughout his time in Salt Lake City. He was solid as a run blocker and decent in pass protection, allowing three sacks in his final year with the Utes, per Pro Football Focus. Buffalo has a fair bit of depth across the offensive line, and thus, Bills' path to the roster is a bit bumpy; he definitely has the best name out of any of this year's UDFAs, though.\n\nRelated: Intriguing guard with fitting name dubbed Bills' UDFA with best shot at roster\n\nA tackle throughout the majority of his time at Auburn, Gunner Britton transitioned to guard in 2023, with 715 of his 791 offensive snaps coming at left guard. His ability to play several spots makes him an intriguing long-term developmental piece for the Bills, a team that historically places great value in linemen with positional versatility -- that said, don't expect him to supplant the likes of Ryan Van Demark and Alec Anderson on the depth chart immediately. He's a prime practice squad candidate for Buffalo.\n\nFormer Campbell Fighting Camels (yes, that's a real team name) tackle Mike Edwards is a mammoth of a man; he's listed at 6-foot-7, 355 pounds on the school's official website. He played left tackle throughout his four years in Buies Creek, even taking seven snaps at defensive tackle in the 2023 season. He's an extreme long shot for Buffalo's active roster, but his physical profile is worth taking a swing on.\n\nPreviously a four-year contributor for the Oklahoma Sooners, David Ugwoegbu transferred to Houston for his fifth collegiate season, notching 41 tackles and three sacks. He'll compete for a rotational role on Buffalo's defensive line, but he, too, is a long shot; he's not a great athlete, and while he's solid against the run, he just lacks the explosion common of NFL pass rushers. NFL.com was not kind to Ugwoegbu in their assessment of him, projecting him as an inside linebacker with poor coverage ability.\n\nRondell Bothroyd transferred to Oklahoma from Wake Forest for his final collegiate season, notching 25 tackles in Norman while failing to register a sack. He did, however, register a team-high eight quarterback hurries, this in addition to 15.5 sacks throughout his time with the Demon Deacons. He, too, will compete with Ugwoegbu for a spot at the bottom of Buffalo's crowded depth chart at defensive end.\n\nRelated: Projecting the Bills' offensive depth chart for the 2024 NFL Season\n\nBuffalo added another undrafted Miami Hurricanes defender in the form of defensive tackle Branson Deen, who transferred to Miami for the 2023 season after recording 25 quarterback hurries and 16 run stops for the Boilermakers in 2022. His production slightly dipped in Miami, registering nine hurries and 13 run stops, per PFF. At 6-foot-2, 280 pounds, he perhaps needs to add a few pounds in order to stick around as an interior defender in the NFL, this in addition to improving his tackling; per PFF, he leaves college with a 17.1% miss tackle percentage.\n\nOhio State is historically a wide receiver factory, and the Bills hope they've found a gem that slipped through the cracks in the form of Xavier Johnson. A three-star recruit out of high school, Johnson was more so used as a gadget player as opposed to a wideout in Columbus, lining up out wide, in the slot, and in the backfield for the Buckeyes last season. He recorded 190 rushing yards and 178 receiving yards in the 2023 season, this in addition to 250 yards on kick returns. At 6-foot-2, 220 pounds, Johnson doesn't project as a traditional wide receiver for Buffalo, but instead as a potentially fun gadget player Joe Brady can deploy in various ways in the preseason. If Johnson can execute on a few of these opportunities and impress on special teams, he could stick at the bottom of the Bills' roster.\n\nA three-star recruit out of high school, Lawrence Keys initially committed to Notre Dame, rarely seeing the field throughout his three seasons in South Bend. He transferred to Tulane ahead of the 2022 season, catching 63 passes for 895 yards and nine touchdowns throughout his two seasons with the Green Wave. He's a fun name to keep tabs on throughout camp; he's a bit unrefined as a route runner and, at 5-foot-10, 170 pounds, is a bit undersized, but he's a versatile receiver with experience in and ability to play both outside and in the slot. He also has kick return ability, returning 23 kicks for an average of 27.1 yards in the 2022 season. He's a long shot, but he has an interesting resume and skill set.\n\nJack Browning kicked and punted for the Aztecs, never missing an extra point while making 74.5% of his field goal attempts throughout his two seasons in San Diego, per PFF. It's his punting statistics that are of larger concern to Bills fans, as he projects as a punter at the professional level. He punted 122 times throughout his stint with the Aztecs, his average punt going for a net of 42.2 yards. He'll compete with Sam Martin for Buffalo's punting and holding job this offseason.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While assessing the Bills' new talent, The Buffalo News' Jay Skurski discussed which players stood out in his Mailbag column.\n\n\"It's a tall order for any of the undrafted free agents to make the 53-man roster,\" Skurski wrote. \"But Western Michigan's Keni-H Lovely could have a shot to stick as the No. 4 cornerback.\"\n\nThe Athletic's Dane Brugler named Lovely as a priority free agent in his draft preview. \"Lovely was an All-State defensive back at Atlantic High. A three-star recruit, he signed with Western Michigan and became a starter for his final two seasons, leading the team in interceptions both years,\" Brugler wrote.\n\nLoverly registered 96 total tackles, 7 passes defensed, 6.0 interceptions, 2 fumble recoveries, and 2 touchdowns.\n\n\"Lovely has outstanding speed and athletic twitch, although premature hip turn and inconsistent pedal/footwork can negate his ability to click and close,\" Brugler continued. \"He flashes a closing burst to make plays on the ball without making early contact.\n\n\"Despite some streaky habits, he is a feisty tackler and gets his man on the ground. Overall, Lovely is undersized and needs better eye balance, but his athletic talent, ball skills and competitive play style might get him drafted.\"\n\nHeading into the 2024 NFL season, Rasul Douglas and Christian Benford look to once again be the Bills starting corners. Buffalo's 2022 first-rounder Kaiir Elam will compete for a more consistent role while Ja'Marcus Ingram and Kyron Brown serve as further depth.\n\nThe Athletic's Joe Buscaglia wrote, \"The Bills could also add a low-cost veteran as their fourth boundary cornerback this season. At nickel, Taron Johnson is one of their best players, and [Cam] Lewis or the sixth-round pick [Daequan] Hardy will be his primary backup. Lewis usually practices with the safeties, so we're not counting him at cornerback for the roster numbers but at safety.\"\n\nThe Bills signed three veteran free agents on May 3, but no cornerbacks. Buffalo could sign a free agent option once the $10.2 million clears from Tre'Davious White's exit. However, Lovely, who ran a 4.37 40-yard dash, could prove that unnecessary.\n\nSI's Kyle Silagyi wrote of Lovely, \"The vast majority of his experience comes on the boundary, as 513 of his 646 defensive snaps in the 2023 season came out wide; the 5-foot-10 defender will compete with the likes of Ja'Marcus Ingram and Kyron Brown for a spot at the bottom of the Bills' depth chart at cornerback.\"\n\nAnother undrafted free agent corner the Bills signed, Te'Cory Couch, has skills more in line with Hardy. Silagyi wrote, \"Couch's path to a roster spot in Buffalo is as a depth nickel defender and special teamer. He primarily played in the slot at Miami, registering 482 snaps as a nickel cornerback last season.\"\n\nCouch recorded 38 total tackles, 4 passes defensed, 3 interceptions, and 1 forced fumble in 2023. \"His size (listed at 5-foot-10, 175 pounds on Miami's website) is a bit of a concern, but he brings a breadth of experience to the Bills,\" SI's analyst wrote. \"He'll compete with 2024 sixth-round pick Daequan Hardy for the team's backup nickel spot in training camp and preseason.\"\n\nHowever, Hardy could make more of an impact on special teams. \"As the full-time punt returner for Penn State last season, Hardy averaged 14.6 yards per return,\" the Bills reported. He \"took a pair back for touchdowns for 56 and 68 yards in the same game vs. UMASS. He became the first player in school history to score multiple punt return touchdowns in one game.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri":

So spoiler alert, get used to the prime-time games for at least one more season.\n\n\"We're not taking our foot off the gas with the Bills,\" North said. \"I don't think there's any question they have one of the best players in the league and that's the must-see TV we've been talking about here.\"\n\nBut what else could we see when the Bills schedule is released?

This was due primarily to the quality (or lack thereof) of the Buffalo Bills roster; for long stretches of the 21st century, Buffalo's roster has been talent and depth deficient, prompting undrafted free agents over the years to deem signing with the Bills an advantageous opportunity to stick with a club.\n\nOh, what a difference a few years makes.\n\nOver the past seven years, general manager Brandon Beane and head coach Sean McDermott have molded Buffalo's roster from one of the league's least talented into one of its deepest, a perennial contender that even McDermott has implied will inevitably win a Super Bowl. An unintended (and not necessarily unwelcome) side effect of a deep roster and yearly contention is difficulty in attracting high-profile undrafted free agents; unselected players generally want relatively clear paths to a roster spot, and few of those paths exist in Western New York.\n\nCircumstances may be a bit different this year, however; Beane made a concerted effort to reset his team's proverbial clock this offseason, moving on from several stalwart starters and shedding significant salary as he recentered his team around youth. The team, while still deep, has more open roles than it has in years past, spots that could be claimed by undrafted free agents should they string together strong outings in training camp and preseason. Though all members of the Bills' 2024 undrafted free agent class are long shots to make the roster, there are a handful of players with comparatively clear paths to the 53-man unit.\n\nHere are three undrafted free agents that we feel have the best shot at making Buffalo's roster.\n\nRelated: Bills UDFA Primer: Meeting the 2024 undrafted free agent class\n\nXavier Johnson may be listed as a wide receiver, but his path to the roster in Western New York does not come as a traditional wideout. He instead projects as a gadget player and special teamer; fortunate for Johnson, both of these roles appear to be open in Buffalo.\n\nRecruited to the Ohio State wide receiver factory as a three-star prospect, Johnson served as a versatile chess piece in Columbus, lining up all over the offense. He took 158 snaps in the slot last season in addition to 41 out wide and 25 in the backfield, picking up 368 yards from scrimmage on 41 touches. He was also a special teams contributor for the Buckeyes, returning 28 kicks throughout his collegiate career.\n\nIt's Johnson's versatility, size, and advantageous situation that make him a contender for the bottom of the Bills' roster. Buffalo revamped its receiving corps in the offseason, moving on from veteran starters Stefon Diggs and Gabriel Davis and replacing them with the likes of Curtis Samuel, Mack Hollins, and rookie Keon Coleman. Johnson won't attempt to replace or usurp any of these players; he simply needs to complement them, to add something to the Bills' offense that it does not currently have.\n\nAnd that element is positional versatility. Buffalo has lacked a true gadget player since it (unsuccessfully) promoted former Bill Isaiah McKenzie to a larger role several seasons ago; it hasn't since had that unique threat that it can deploy and get the ball to from several spots. Johnson, as of now, seems to be the only player on the team's roster that has this functionality; Samuel is relatively versatile, but he projects as a starter for the team as opposed to a situational gadget player.\n\nAt 6-foot, 202 pounds, Johnson also has the size necessary to survive out wide, in the slot, or in the backfield at the professional level. Add in the fact that he'll factor into the team's offseason competition for primary kick and punt return duties, and you have the makings of an advantageous situation.\n\nLet's raise a hypothetical scenario where the Bills roster six receivers, with Coleman, Samuel, Hollins, and the returning Khalil Shakir being the locks; this leaves Johnson in competition with the likes of Chase Claypool, Andy Isabella, Justin Shorter, Tyrell Shavers, KJ Hamler, and Quintez Cephus for the final two spots. Johnson is really the only player of these names who could be used in 'gadget' situations; factor in his special teams ability, and you can see why he's an interesting name to keep an eye on this summer.\n\nBuffalo did not select a true boundary cornerback in the 2024 NFL Draft, its only selections in the secondary being second-round safety Cole Bishop and sixth-round nickel defender Daequan Hardy. This not only bodes well for the outside corners already on its roster (namely Christian Benford and Kaiir Elam), but also for the undrafted free agents who will attempt to earn a spot at the bottom of its roster.\n\nThe lone boundary corner who was reportedly signed with the Bills as an undrafted free agent, former Western Michigan defender Keni-H Lovely perhaps has the best opportunity of any of his undrafted peers to make Buffalo's roster thanks to his competition, or rather, lack thereof. Not including the versatile Cam Lewis (who, despite experience out wide, has fully transitioned to safety), Lovely is one of six objective boundary corners on the Bills' roster; while he's currently at the bottom of the depth chart, he only has to usurp Kyron Brown and Ja'Marcus Ingram to become the team's fourth outside corner.\n\nLovely, who notched 108 tackles throughout his time at Western Michigan, is a solid athlete who possesses traits that Buffalo's coaching staff values in its defenders. He simply has that innate 'nose for the football' and always seems to be around it, this evidenced by his 10 career pass deflections, six interceptions, and four forced fumbles. Factor in the reported 4.35-second 40-yard dash he ran at his Pro Day, and you can see why there's reason for optimism here.\n\nWhile still a long shot, it's not difficult to imagine Lovely, given his athletic ability and ball-hawing nature, usurping Brown and Ingram on the depth chart throughout the summer; being the fourth boundary corner on the depth chart would also certainly secure him a roster spot. If unable to crack the active roster, he's a prime practice squad candidate.\n\nRelated: Projecting the Bills' defensive depth chart for the 2024 NFL Season\n\nA former Western Kentucky Hilltopper, offensive lineman Gunner Britton transferred to the bright lights of the SEC for his fifth collegiate season, joining the Auburn Tigers. He shifted from tackle to guard for the Tigers, displaying a bit of positional versatility that could allow him to stick around in Buffalo for the foreseeable future.\n\nHe played both left and right tackle for the Hilltoppers in 2022, allowing three sacks and 10 total pressures, per Pro Football Focus. He improved on these numbers at guard in Auburn, still allowing three sacks in addition to a reduced eight pressures. He also graded well as a run blocker, with his talent and 6-foot-6 athletic build making him a ball of clay worth molding.\n\nHe's admittedly the least likely to make Buffalo's roster of the names listed here, but there is a path; Buffalo places great value in versatile offensive linemen who can play various roles in a pinch, and Britton, given his experience at both left and right tackle and left guard, fits this bill. It's difficult to imagine him usurping players like Alec Anderson, Ryan Van Demark, and the recently signed La'el Collins on the depth chart, but it's not an egregious thought. Britton perhaps best projects as a priority practice squad signing with a chance at claiming a roster spot with a strong camp.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

Half of the Bills' draft class perhaps cemented themselves as targets -- or initially popped up on the team's radar -- in Mobile, AL, as five of the prospects whom Buffalo grabbed in the 2024 NFL Draft played in the 2024 Reese's Senior Bowl, an annual event in which collegiate prospects both renowned and undiscovered are invited to work with professional coaching staffs and make an impact on NFL front offices.\n\nSenior Bowl Executive Director Jim Nagy recently took to X to break down what Bills fans can expect from these five particular players, projecting immediate and long-term roles for each prospect while indirectly putting Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown on the hot seat.\n\nThe Bills grabbed three-year Utah safety Cole Bishop with the 60th overall pick in the draft, a prospect Nagy described as \"an athletic interchangeable safety\" who should start straight away. Bishop, who tallied 197 tackles, 12 pass deflections, and three interceptions throughout his time in Salt Lake City, joins a Buffalo defensive backfield that moved on from Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer in the offseason, paving the way for the 21-year-old to compete with Taylor Rapp and the recently signed Mike Edwards for a starting job. Bishop's versatility, noted by Nagy, will be advantageous in Western New York, as the Bills, for several years, deployed Hyde and Poyer interchangeably. The former scout also wrote that the defensive back has Pro Bowl potential and expects him to be a top jersey seller for the team.\n\nNagy sees locker room and political leadership in DeWayne Carter's future, projecting Buffalo's third-round pick as a reliable rotational three-technique who is \"likely [an] eventual captain and mayor of Buffalo.\" He even sees the disruptive former Duke Blue Devil \"push[ing] for a starting job at some point as a rookie,\" but this is perhaps a bit too optimistic; should Carter play three-tech, he'd be stuck behind Ed Oliver, who is currently signed to the Bills through the 2027 NFL season. That said, he should provide consistent tenacity in a rotational role; he notched 24.5 tackles for loss and 12 sacks throughout his collegiate career.\n\nRelated: Which Bills UDFAs have best chance to make the roster?\n\nNagy was also complimentary of Buffalo's fourth-and-fifth-round picks, calling Kentucky running back Ray Davis a \"sneaky fantasy touchdown vulture\" and Washington linebacker Edefuan Ulofoshio a \"top testing and A+ character three down backup\" who can contribute straight away on special teams. Ulofoshio, who recorded a 9.55 relative athletic score, is a rangy linebacker the likes of which the Bills have featured in the middle of their defense since Sean McDermott arrived several years ago.\n\nNagy rounded out his draft recap with praise for Troy pass rusher Javon Solomon, who led college football with 18 total sacks in his senior season. Nagy expects him to win a rotational role straight away, which, given Buffalo's lack of depth at defensive end, is perhaps more an expectation than a possibility; the executive likened him to a \"looser version of Bryce Huff.\"\n\nBuffalo didn't necessarily execute any blockbuster maneuvers throughout the 2024 NFL Draft, but all of its selections were calculated, and one could make a legitimate argument for all 10 of them making the 53-man roster. If Nagy's projections manifest, 'making the roster' is just the start for several of these prospects.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors":

Buffalo is coming off a 2023 season in which it finished ninth in yards allowed per game (307.2) and fourth in points allowed per game (18.3), marking the team's third consecutive finish among the league's top 10 leaders in total defense and fifth under McDermott's leadership.\n\nBuffalo's defense underwent a bit of a revamp in the 2024 offseason, however, with the team moving on from stalwart safeties Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer and cornerback Tre'Davious White, all of whom have started for the team (when healthy) since 2017. While key cogs like Matt Milano, Greg Rousseau, and Taron Johnson are set to return, the turnover at the position has sparked concern from some; in his recent ranking of every defensive unit in the NFL, Bleacher Report's Alex Ballentine listed the Bills' defense as the 17th best in the league, noting the aforementioned departures and the losses of rotational pass rusher Leonard Floyd and linebacker Tyrel Dodson as reasons for concern.\n\n\"The Bills had to replace all of those pieces on a budget and there's bound to be some drop off,\" Ballentine wrote. \"They do, however, still have Milano in the middle of it all and they still have Greg Rousseau and Ed Oliver up front. Rasul Douglas and Christian Benford is a solid cornerback duo and they have coaching continuity with Sean McDermott still in charge.\n\n\"There are enough familiar faces to be alright. They will need some unexpected depth to emerge if they are going to do better than that.\"\n\nBallentine also writes that Buffalo's defense can exceed expectations if second-round pick Cole Bishop shows early promise and the NFL's active sack leader in Von Miller can return to form.\n\nRelated: Projecting the Bills' defensive depth chart for the 2024 NFL Season\n\nAll football fans, writers, and pundits are entitled to their own opinions, but ranking the Bills' defense among the bottom half of the league, frankly, seems a bit harsh. There's objectively some uncertainty given the significant turnover, but it's not as though Buffalo has not been without the likes of Hyde, White, and Poyer in the recent past. Hyde missed all but two games in the 2022 NFL season due to a neck injury; the Bills finished sixth in yards allowed per game that year. White has missed long stretches over the past three seasons due to various significant leg injuries; Buffalo has finished among the league leaders in total defense in each of these seasons.\n\nSure, this will be the first time that the Bills will be without all three of their stalwarts for an extended period, but McDermott, throughout his stint as Buffalo's head coach, has consistently shown the ability to coach up defensive backs and make the most of what he has. Think back to 2017, when the very players pundits are now concerned about Buffalo losing emerged thanks to McDermott making something out of nothing.\n\nThe Bills are also (largely) replacing their departed starters with experienced players who have been around the system. Rasul Douglas, who was acquired by the team at the 2023 trade deadline, continues as the team's No. 1 corner after replacing the injured White in the role last season. Hyde and Poyer will be replaced by Taylor Rapp, who returns from last season, and the recently signed Mike Edwards. Every other starter returns from last season.\n\nBuffalo's defensive departures could, in theory, prove to be the unit's death knell, but that seems like a rash judgment at this juncture.

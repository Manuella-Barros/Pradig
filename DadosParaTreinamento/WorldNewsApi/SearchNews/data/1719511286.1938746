Together, they wrote dozens of songs for Disney TV productions and movies such as \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d \u201cThe Absent-Minded Professor,\u201d \u201cSummer Magic,\u201d \u201cThat Darn Cat!,\u201d \u201cThe Sword in the Stone,\u201d \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d \u201cThe Aristocats,\u201d \u201cBedknobs and Broomsticks\u201d and \u201cWinnie the Pooh\u201d cartoons. They also penned the theme song for Disney\u2019s TV show \u201cThe Wonderful World of Color\u201d and wrote songs heard in Disney theme-park attractions, including \u201cThe Tiki Tiki Tiki Room,\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\u201d and the unforgettable \u2013 in ways both good and bad \u2013\u201cIt\u2019s a Small World (After All).\u201d \u201cThey were made by God for Walt Disney,\u201d said Dick Van Dyke, who stared in \u201cMary Poppins\u201d opposite Julia Andrew. \u201cThey somehow managed to convey Walt\u2019s meaning in those songs.\u201d The gregarious half of the prolific songwriting duo, Sherman died Saturday, May 25, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Beverly Hills, due to age-related illness. He was 95. The Walt Disney Company announced the news of his death in a press statement. Robert Sherman, who was two-and-a-half years older than his brother, died in London in 2012 at 86. They were struggling songwriters when they (and Bob Roberts) wrote \u201cTall Paul,\u201d which became a No. 7 hit in 1959 for Annette Funicello, who the brothers regard as their \u201cLuck Star.\u201d That led to the Shermans writing a string of other pop songs for the ex-Mousketeer, including the hit \u201cPineapple Princess.\u201d And that, in turn, led to assignments writing songs for various film and TV productions at the Disney studios. During one fateful meeting with \u201cthe boys\u201d in August 1960, Disney handed them a copy of a book and said, \u201cRead it, and tell me what you think.\u201d The book was \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d P.L. Travers\u2019 tale of a magical English nanny. Sherman considered \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d which starred Julie Andrews in the title role and Dick Van Dyke as Bert the chimney sweep, as \u201cthe turning point in our lives, and it\u2019s the highest point in our career.\u201d After reading the book, he and his brother \u201cunderlined some chapters that we felt were really musical. And when we showed Walt our notes and played the song sketches, he pulled out his book, and he\u2019d underlined the very same chapters,\u201d Sherman recalled in a 2011 interview with the Patriot Ledger of Quincy, Massachusetts. At the end of their meeting, Disney surprised them by asking them if they\u2019d like to work full-time at the studio. It was, Sherman said, \u201cthe greatest day of our lives.\u201d He never forgot the moment, once \u201cMary Poppins\u201d finally got underway, when he first heard Andrews singing one of their songs for the movie. \u201cShe sang \u2018A Spoonful of Sugar\u2019 in her incredible voice,\u201d he recalled in a 2011 interview with the Philadelphia Daily News. \u201cI was sitting in [the recording] booth listening to it, and I was crying. It was magical.\u201d Van Dyke told The Times after Robert Sherman died that the Sherman brothers were \u201cdeeply involved\u201d throughout the filming of \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d which earned Andrews the best actress Oscar. \u201cThey were always on the set helping Julie and I with our interpretation of the songs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had a lot to do with the atmosphere, the lightness.\u201d The Shermans\u2019 hauntingly poignant \u201cFeed the Birds, about an older woman selling bags of crumbs to feed the hungry birds, was Disney\u2019s favorite song from \u201cMary Poppins.\u201d The song, Sherman told the Philadelphia Daily News in 2011, was really a \u201cprayer for understanding \u2013 be kind, give love. It doesn\u2019t cost anything.\u201d When Disney first heard their musical concept for the song, he told them, \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, isn\u2019t it?\u201d From then on, Disney would often meet with the Shermans in his office on Friday afternoons to discuss what was going on at the studio. Then he\u2019d say, \u201cPlay it.\u201d \u201cSo I would play piano and sing \u2018Feed the Birds\u2019 for him,\u201d Richard Sherman recalled in a 2004 Sacramento Bee interview. \u201cThen he\u2019d say, \u2018Well, have a good weekend, boys,\u2019 and we\u2019d go home. That was our Friday afternoon.\u201d After Disney died in 1966, \u201cit just wasn\u2019t the same,\u201d Sherman said in a 1985 Times interview. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to say anything negative about anyone [at Disney]. It just wasn\u2019t the same with Walt gone.\u201d After leaving the studio in 1968, the Sherman brothers wrote songs for films such as \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d and collaborated on screenplays for films such as \u201cTom Sawyer,\u201d \u201cHuckleberry Finn,\u201d \u201cThe Slipper and the Rose: The Story of Cinderella,\u201d and \u201cThe Magic of Lassie.\u201d They also wrote the music and lyrics for the Tony Award-nominated 1974 Broadway musical \u201cOver Here!,\u201d starring Maxene and Patty Andrews. Besides their two Oscar wins for \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d they received five Oscar nominations for their work on \u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang,\u201d \u201cBedknobs and Broomsticks,\u201d \u201cTom Sawyer\u201d and \u201cThe Slipper and the Rose.\u201d The Shermans, who were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, were awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2008 for their creation of music that \u201chas helped bring joy to millions.\u201d The son of Tin Pan Alley songwriter Al Sherman, Richard Sherman was born in New York City on June 12, 1928. The family moved to Beverly Hills in 1938. While Richard attended Beverly Hills High School during World War II, Robert served in the Army in Europe, where he was among the first GIs to enter the Dachau concentration camp after the Germans fled and was later seriously wounded in the knee. After the war, both brothers entered Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. Robert studied literature; Richard majored in music. After they graduated, Richard had ambitions of becoming a symphonic composer and his brother had designs on writing the great American novel. But as Richard later recalled, \u201cNothing was happening with either of us.\u201d They were sharing a small apartment above a dry cleaner on West Pico Boulevard in 1951 when their father offered them a challenge: write a song that some kid would give up his lunch money to buy. They wound up writing a country-western song called \u201cGold Can Buy Anything (But Love),\u201d which was recorded by singing cowboy star Gene Autry in 1951. More songs followed, but the brothers went their separate ways after Richard served a stint in the Army from 1953 to 1955. They both had written songs with other partners before they reteamed in 1958 for \u201cTall Paul.\u201d Among their hits was Johnny Burnette\u2019s 1960 recording of \u201cYou\u2019re Sixteen,\u201d which peaked at No. 8. It reached No. 1 in 1974 when Ringo Starr recorded the song. Although Richard was primarily the composer and Robert the lyricist, they typically worked together on both the words and music. Indeed, when asked who did what, their standard reply was, \u201cHe writes the words and the music, and I write the music and the words.\u201d Despite their close professional collaboration \u2013 they often completed one another\u2019s sentences \u2013 the Sherman brothers and their families led separate personal lives since the mid-\u201960s. Their strained personal relationship was revealed in the 2009 documentary \u201cThe Boys: The Sherman Brothers\u2019 Story,\u201d directed by Richard\u2019s son, Gregory; and Robert\u2019s son, Jeff. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single specific incident. But I remember the walls going up between our fathers and our families in 1965,\u201d Jeff Sherman told the Toronto Star in 2009. \u201cBob and I have great love and respect for one another, and during our professional lives we maintained a facade of unity,\u201d Richard said. \u201cBut in order to keep working together we came to an agreement to live our personal lives apart, completely separate. We were comfortable working together, but otherwise, it would have been explosive.\u201d They were, he said, \u201cvery different people.\u201d \u201cIn the broadest terms, Bob is an introvert who wanted to write great novels, and I was the showman,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved to perform, and he\u2019d rather sit in a corner reading a book. \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re not idiots. We had something good going on. Success and creativity won out over petty personal differences. There was no way we were going to let those differences destroy our work.\u201d Richard is survived by his wife of 66 years, Elizabeth; son Gregory and grandsons William and Matthew; daughter Victoria Wolf, son-in-law Doug Wolf, and grandchildren Mandy and Anthony. He is also survived by his daughter from a previous marriage, Lynda Rothstein, as well as her two children and three grandchildren. A private funeral is scheduled to take place May 31 at Hillside Memorial Park and Mortuary in Los Angeles. Plans for a celebration of life will be announced at a later date. \u00a92024 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com.

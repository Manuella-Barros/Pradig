The first overseas town hall meeting with the Executive Chair was also held with Hyundai Motor India employees.\n\nAmid the growing strategic importance of India, Executive Chair Chung's visit to the country is aimed at solidifying the group's position as a leading mobility provider in India, while exploring various business opportunities in the rapidly evolving Indian market.\n\nCelebrating its 30th anniversary in 2026, Hyundai Motor India is developing its 2030 strategy under the slogan 'Innovator in Mobility and Beyond'. Kia India, which has also quickly grown into a major Indian automobile brand, is also promoting quantitative and qualitative growth through its 'Kia 2.0' strategy.\n\nHyundai Motor Group is delivering a major manufacturing advance in the Indian region with the establishment of an annual production system of 1.5 million vehicle units for Hyundai Motor India and Kia India combined.\n\nThe Group will expand its EV lineup and create an EV ecosystem to accelerate customer uptake and expand charging infrastructure. It will also strengthen its SUV sales leadership and promote social responsibility activities in consideration of Indian culture.\n\nExecutive Chair Chung conducted an in-depth review of and engaged in detailed discussions on Hyundai Motor Group's mid-to-long-term strategies in India at the new Hyundai Motor India Headquarters Delhi office, situated in Gurugram.\n\nA town hall meeting was also held on April 23 to communicate in person with Hyundai Motor India employees. The purpose of the meeting was to share the group's vision and engage with colleagues ahead of new opportunities such as the establishment of an annual production system of one million units and promotion of the Group's electrification strategy.\n\nThe event marked the first time that Executive Chair Chung held a town hall meeting outside of Korea. He has previously conducted two town hall meetings in Korea and last year led Hyundai Motor Group's New Year's event in the form of a town hall meeting.\n\nMid-to long-term strategies to solidify HMG's position\n\nHyundai has set its mid-to-long-term strategies to proactively respond to the Indian automotive market. Key to this is the laying of groundwork to expand production. Hyundai Motor India will start operating its Pune plant in the second half of next year.\n\nLocated in Maharashtra, western India, the production facility was acquired from GM last year. Hyundai Motor is currently making improvements to the facility to create a production hub capable of building more than 2,00,000 units annually, using smart manufacturing technology and systems.\n\nWith the addition of the Chennai plant's production capacity of 8,24,000 units, Hyundai Motor will have an annual production capacity of over one million units when combined with the Pune plant.\n\nKia India's yearly production capacity will also be expanded to 4,31,000 units within the first half of this year. Combined, Hyundai Motor Group will have the ability to produce approximately 1.5 million units annually in India.\n\nHyundai's electrification strategy\n\nHyundai Motor Group also plans to strengthen its EV leadership in the Indian EV market through a new strategy. Hyundai plans to unveil its first locally produced EV in India next year and proactively respond to the growth of the Indian EV market.\n\nStarting with the mass production of its first electric SUV model at the Chennai plant at the end of 2024, the company plans to further produce five EV models by 2030. Hyundai Motor India will also utilize its sales network hubs, expanding the number of EV charging stations to 485 by 2030.\n\nKia India will also start production of its local EV model in 2025 and plans to further expand its EV models. The company will also focus on building EV charging infrastructure.\n\nHyundai Motor and Kia recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Exide Energy and are pursuing the local production of batteries for dedicated Indian EV models.\n\nThe group aims to expand its presence in the local EV market, by localizing the production of EV batteries, which account for a significant portion of EV cost. This strategy will ensure price competitiveness in the price-sensitive Indian market.\n\nThe town hall meeting\n\nDuring the meeting, Executive Chair Chung emphasized the strategic importance of the Indian region. \"Hyundai Motor India has been pivotal in driving the growth of the Hyundai Motor Group, having navigated through numerous challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic, global economic crises, and supply chain disruptions due to semiconductor shortages. We take pride in consistently securing the second-largest market share in this vibrant market and will continue to elevate Hyundai as a premium brand.\"\n\nHe added, \"India is among the fastest-growing economies globally, and as this growth continues, the strategic importance of Hyundai Motor India will only increase. By leveraging our strong reputation and competitive quality in India, we aim to expand exports to neighbouring countries, making India the global export hub to boost our regional market competitiveness.\"", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "express_mobility_desk@financialexpress.com", "name": "Express

He conducted an in-depth review and engaged in detailed discussions on Hyundai Motor Group's mid to long-term strategies in India at the new Hyundai Motor India Headquarter Delhi office in Gurugram.\n\nAlongside Executive Chair Chung, key executives from Hyundai Motor - including Jaehoon Chang, the President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, and Unsoo Kim, Managing Director and CEO of Hyundai Motor India - participated, in addition to 400 Hyundai Motor India employees.\n\nFor the first time Executive Chair Chung held a town hall meeting outside Korea, the company said.\n\nAmid the growing strategic importance of India, Executive Chair Chung's visit to the country is aimed at solidifying the Group's position as a leading mobility provider in India, while exploring various business opportunities in the rapidly evolving Indian market. The Group is also committed to fulfilling its social responsibilities through culturally attuned CSR and ESG activities, in addition to positioning itself as an attractive company for Indian customers, the company said in a media release.\n\nFor its 30 anniversary in 2026, Hyundai Motor India is developing its 2030 strategy under the slogan 'Innovator in Mobility and Beyond'. Kia India, which has also quickly grown into a major Indian automobile brand, is also promoting quantitative and qualitative growth through its 'Kia 2.0' strategy.\n\nEV lineup: The Hyundai Motor Group will expand its EV lineup and create an EV ecosystem to accelerate customer uptake and expand charging infrastructure.\n\nThe Group also plans to strengthen its EV leadership in the Indian EV market through its electrification strategy.\n\nHyundai Motor India plans to unveil its first locally produced EV in India next year and proactively respond to the growth of the Indian EV market. Starting with the mass production of its first electric SUV model at the Chennai plant at the end of 2024, the company plans to further produce five EV models by 2030.\n\n\"By around 2030, we expect to see a substantial expansion in the EV market. In anticipation of this evolution, Hyundai is focused on developing locally tailored EVs aimed at establishing us as a leading global EV brand,\" explained Executive Chair Chung. \"We also plan to proactively build charging stations at strategic locations - including dealerships - to facilitate the adoption of EVs,\" he added.\n\nPune plant: Hyundai Motor India will start operating its Pune plant in the second half of next year. Located in Maharashtra, western India, the production facility was acquired from GM last year. With the addition of the Chennai plant's production capacity of 824,000 units, Hyundai Motor will have an annual production capacity of over one million units when combined with the Pune plant.\n\nTown hall meeting: Sharing a vision and strengthening trust ahead of new challenges\n\nMore than 3,000 employees also joined the town hall meeting online, including those at Hyundai Motor India headquarters in Gurugram, the Chennai Plant, Pune Plant, and each regional headquarters.\n\nExecutive Chair Chung said at the beginning of the meeting, \"Our customer-centric mind set is always at the heart of our business to enhance what we can offer our customers and to better humanity.\"\n\nExecutive Chair Chung also focused on India's diversity, saying: \"India is a diverse country, and combined with Hyundai Motor Group employees' creativity and collaboration this can be our strength.\"\n\nExplaining the reason that he suggested the town hall meeting in India, Executive Chair Chung said, \"The success of these ambitious initiatives by Hyundai Motor India is a testament to the creative and innovative efforts of our employees across the region.\"\n\nExtolling Hyundai Motor Group's success in the Indian market, Executive Chair Chung highlighted Hyundai Motor Group's technological strengths as well as the loyalty and trust of those who have chosen Hyundai for many years.\n\n\"Hyundai brought its expertise in producing compact cars and advanced technology. The favorable conditions of the Indian automobile market combined with Hyundai's technological strengths led to synergistic results,\" added Executive Chair Chung. \"However, above all else, the key factors behind Hyundai's success in India are the dedication of its employees, who are among the brightest minds globally and demonstrate profound integrity.\"\n\nDuring the meeting, Executive Chair Chung also emphasized the strategic importance of the Indian region.\n\n\"Hyundai Motor India has been pivotal in driving the growth of the Hyundai Motor Group, having navigated through numerous challenges including the COVID19 pandemic, global economic crises, and supply chain disruptions due to semiconductor shortages. We take pride in consistently securing the second-largest market share in this vibrant market and will continue to elevate Hyundai as a premium brand. India is among the fastest-growing economies globally, and as this growth continues the strategic importance of Hyundai Motor India will only increase. By leveraging our strong reputation and competitive quality in India, we aim to expand exports to neighbouring countries, making India the global export hub to boost our regional market competitiveness.\"", "source": {"uri": "auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETAuto.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A major focus of the group will be on electrics as it begins to locally produce competitive and cost-effective vehicles from 2025.\n\n\"The Group will expand its EV lineup and create an EV ecosystem to accelerate customer uptake and expand charging infrastructure. It will also strengthen its SUV sales leadership and promote social responsibility activities,\" the company said.\n\nChung said by around 2030, HMG expects to see a substantial expansion in the EV market. \"In anticipation of this evolution, Hyundai is focused on developing locally tailored EVs aimed at establishing us as a leading global EV brand... We also plan to proactively build charging stations at strategic locations - including dealerships - to facilitate the adoption of EVs.\"\n\nHyundai is expected to be working on an IPO for India, as the company is spending Rs 32,000 crore in the country for various expansion activities.\n\nThe company said it has started work to add the Maharashtra factory - acquired from GM last year -- to Hyundai's India production footprint. This will be completed by the middle of next year and bring in a fresh 2 lakh units to its current production capacity of 8.24 lakh units. Kia's yearly production will also be expanded to 4.3 lakh units within the first half of this year. \"Combined together, HMG will have the ability to produce approximately 1.5 million units annually in India,\" Chung said.\n\nOn EVs, he said that Hyundai will unveil its first locally-produced green next year. \"Starting with the mass production of its first electric SUV model at the Chennai plant at the end of 2024, the company plans to further produce five EV models by 2030. Hyundai Motor India will also utilize its sales network hubs, expanding the number of EV charging stations to 485 by 2030.\"\n\nIndustry sources said that the first car to be locally electrified by Hyundai is likely to be the Creta SUV.\n\nKia India will also start production of its local EV model in 2025 and plans to further expand its EV models, while building charging infrastructure.\n\nHMG will also localize the production of EV batteries as they account for a significant portion of an EV's cost.\n\n\"Hyundai brought its expertise in producing compact cars and advanced technology. The favorable conditions of the Indian automobile market combined with Hyundai's technological strengths led to synergistic results,\" Chung said.\n\nHe said that India holds \"strategic importance\" for the group. \"Hyundai Motor India has been pivotal in driving the growth of the Hyundai Motor Group, having navigated through numerous challenges including the Covid-19 pandemic, global economic crises, and supply chain disruptions due to semiconductor shortages. We take pride in consistently securing the second-largest market share in this vibrant market.\"\n\nAlso, he said India will be increasingly used for exports. \"India is among the fastest-growing economies globally, and as this growth continues, the strategic importance of Hyundai India will only increase. By leveraging our strong reputation and competitive quality in India, we aim to expand exports to neighboring countries, making India the global export hub to boost our regional market

Production Starts End 2024 - Group Plant Capacity To Increase To 15 Lakh", "body": "Hyundai's first local EV will be Creta EV, already spotted testing, and production will commence by the end of 2024 at their Chennai plant\n\nAhead of its 30th anniversary in 2026, Hyundai Motor India is already coining its 2030 strategy. The slogan for 2030 strategy is 'Innovator in Mobility and Beyond'. Hyundai's subsidiary, Kia India, has also overhauled its operations to promote quantitative and qualitative growth through company's 'Kia 2.0' strategy.\n\nIn that regard, Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung visited India to review the company's mid-to-long-term mobility strategies for the future. This is the first time the Executive Chair has held an overseas town hall meeting outside of South Korea. Also present in the meeting were key executives from Hyundai Motor including Jaehoon Chang, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, and Unsoo Kim, Managing Director and CEO of Hyundai Motor India.\n\nThe meeting concluded a manufacturing advance in the rapidly growing Indian automotive market. The aim is to establish an annual production capacity of around 1.5 million vehicles combining both Hyundai and Kia brands in India. A key facilitator of this plan will be expansion of EV lineup and create an EV ecosystem to accelerate customer uptake.\n\nThe commencement of production at Hyundai's recently acquired Pune plant (from GM) last year will play a major role in achieving their goals. Company is currently making improvements towards Pune plant and establishing a production hub capable of 2 lakh units annually. Production is estimated to start in second half of 2025.\n\nCombining Pune plant's 2 lakh capacity with Chennai plant's current production capacity of 8.24 lakh units, Hyundai Motor is looking at an annual production capacity of over 10 lakh (1 million) units. Kia India's annual production capacity is set to be expanded to 4.31 lakh units by the first half of 2024. Combining Kia's numbers, Hyundai Motor Group is looking at an annual production capacity of 15 lakh per annum (1.5 million).\n\nElectric vehicles will play a crucial role in the company's growth ambitions. Hyundai aims to launch its first locally produced EV in Indian market in 2025. This is likely to be Creta EV which is already spotted testing on multiple occasions. Mass production of its first local electric SUV (Creta EV) will commence by the end of 2024 at Hyundai's Chennai plant.\n\nThe company aims to expand EV portfolio to incorporate five new EVs by 2030. The holistic approach by Hyundai Motor India towards EVs will result in expanding EV charging infrastructure by 2030. Not just Hyundai, Kia is keen to make a splash in Indian EV space with their first local EV slated to hit production in 2025 with more to break covers in the future.\n\nRecently, Hyundai and Kia signed an MoU with Exide, a leading Indian battery company, in a bid to pursue local manufacturing of batteries that will power dedicated EVs for India.\n\nDuring the meeting, Executive Chair Chung said \"Hyundai Motor India has been pivotal in driving the growth of the Hyundai Motor Group, having navigated through numerous challenges including the COVID19 pandemic, global economic crises, and supply chain disruptions due to semiconductor shortages. We take pride in consistently securing the second-largest market share in this vibrant market and will continue to elevate Hyundai as a premium brand.\n\n\"India is among the fastest-growing economies globally, and as this growth continues the strategic importance of Hyundai Motor India will only increase. By leveraging our strong reputation and competitive quality in India, we aim to expand exports to neighbouring countries, making India the global export hub to boost our regional market competitiveness.\"\n\nSpeaking about the company's electrification strategy, Executive Chair Chung said, \"We will develop EVs tailored to the Indian market and expand EV infrastructure in the region. We will lead the next generation of mobility in India, playing a key role in electrification, and we will continue to elevate Hyundai as a premium brand.\"", "source": {"uri": "rushlane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RushLane"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akshay_kulkarni@rushlane.com", "name": "Akshay Kulkarni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kia India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Creta", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Creta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Group", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charging station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorandum of understanding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Wholesale_Trade/General_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Business/Wholesale Trade/General Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.rushlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hyundai-creta-n-line-launched-in-india-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507092", "eventUri": "eng-9507092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

With a rapidly expanding middle class and a young demographic inclined towards aspirational lifestyles, India presents a lucrative market for automakers looking to expand their footprint. The country's growing economy, coupled with government initiatives promoting electric vehicles (EVs) and sustainable mobility, further enhances its appeal to global automotive giants seeking new growth opportunities.\n\nIndia's strategic position as a manufacturing hub offers significant advantages to international car manufacturers. India's significance as a key market for global automotive companies is underscored by Hyundai Motor Group's strategic initiatives aimed at fortifying its presence in the country. Recently, Hyundai's Executive Chair, Euisun Chung, visited India to assess the Group's future mobility strategies, reflecting the company's commitment to leveraging India's potential within its global framework.\n\nThe visit aligns with Hyundai Motor Group's overarching goal of consolidating its position as a premier mobility provider in India, capitalising on the nation's dynamic business landscape. Central to this strategy is the expansion of production capacity, with Hyundai Motor India set to commence operations at its Pune plant in the latter half of next year. This facility, acquired from GM in the previous year, is being upgraded to accommodate a production capacity exceeding 200,000 units annually, integrating smart manufacturing technologies for enhanced efficiency.\n\nAlso Read : Hyundai India eyes record rural sales: expects 20% contribution to total sales\n\nBy augmenting its Chennai plant's capacity to 824,000 units per year and expanding Kia India's production capacity to 431,000 units in the first half of this year, Hyundai Motor Group is poised to achieve a combined annual production capacity of approximately 1.5 million units in India. Beyond bolstering domestic sales, the Group aims to strengthen its foothold in the exports market, leveraging India's growing economy. Executive Chair Chung emphasised India's strategic importance, highlighting Hyundai Motor India's role as a key export hub to enhance regional market competitiveness.\n\n\"By leveraging our strong reputation and competitive quality in India, we aim to expand exports to neighbouring countries, making India the global export hub to boost our regional market competitiveness,\" Executive Chair Chung stated, emphasising India's strategic importance and Hyundai Motor India's pivotal role in the Group's global operations.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) have garnered significant global attention over the past decade, with India emerging as a key growth market in this space. While global EV growth has faced challenges, India's EV market is on a steady rise. Recognising this trend, Hyundai Motor Group is aiming to bolster its leadership in the Indian EV market through a robust electrification strategy.\n\nHyundai Motor India is set to unveil its first locally produced EV in India next year, kickstarting a plan to introduce five EV models by 2030. The company aims to commence mass production of its first electric SUV model at the Chennai plant by the end of 2024. To support this initiative, Hyundai Motor India plans to expand its EV charging infrastructure, targeting 485 charging stations by 2030.\n\nSimilarly, Kia India plans to commence production of its local EV model in 2025, with a focus on expanding its EV lineup and building a comprehensive EV charging network.\n\nHyundai Motor and Kia have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Exide Energy Solutions Ltd., a prominent Indian battery company, to locally produce batteries for dedicated Indian EV models. This move is strategic, aiming to localise production and enhance price competitiveness, crucial in India's price-sensitive market. Executive Chair Chung highlighted the company's commitment to developing locally tailored EVs and expanding EV infrastructure to establish Hyundai as a leading global EV brand.\n\nHe emphasised proactive measures, such as building charging stations at strategic locations, including dealerships, to facilitate widespread EV adoption in India. This electrification strategy underscores Hyundai Motor Group's ambition to spearhead the next generation of mobility in India, positioning Hyundai as a premium brand synonymous with innovation and sustainability.\n\n\"By around 2030, we expect to see a substantial expansion in the EV market. In anticipation of this evolution, Hyundai is focused on developing locally tailored EVs aimed at establishing us as a leading global EV brand,\" explained Executive Chair Chung. He further added, \"We will develop EVs tailored to the Indian market and expand EV infrastructure in the region. We will lead the next generation of mobility in India, playing a key role in electrification, and we will continue to elevate Hyundai as a premium brand.\"\n\nDuring his visit to India, Executive Chair Chung not only highlighted the growing business opportunities for the Hyundai Group but also underscored the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for the company. He emphasised the company's customer-centric approach, stating, \"Our customer-centric mindset is always at the heart of our business to enhance what we can offer our customers and to better humanity,\" reflecting Hyundai's core philosophy.\n\nAdditionally, he acknowledged India's diversity, noting, \"India is a diverse country, and combined with Hyundai Motor Group employees' creativity and collaboration, this can be our strength.\"\n\nExecutive Chair Chung also commended Hyundai Motor India for its role in driving the growth of the Hyundai Motor Group, particularly amidst challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, global economic crises, and semiconductor shortages. He expressed pride in Hyundai consistently securing the second-largest market share in India, affirming the company's commitment to elevating Hyundai as a premium brand in the country.\n\nMoreover, Executive Chair Chung outlined Hyundai's plans for social responsibility in the region, stating, \"Hyundai's success in India is rooted not just in our business operations but in our commitment to humanity and social responsibility.\" He highlighted Hyundai's commitment to advancing carbon neutrality and supporting the circular economy for sustainable growth.\n\nChung also emphasised Hyundai's initiatives to address social issues through product design and provide opportunities for youth groups and the underprivileged to develop skills and pursue their dreams, showcasing the company's dedication to creating a positive impact on society.\n\nIn 2006, Hyundai Motor India established the Hyundai Motor India Foundation (HMIF) to actively engage in social responsibility activities and support various social causes. The company has planted over 80,000 trees since then to protect forests and water resources. Additionally, Hyundai is recycling factory waste materials into desks and chairs, as well as upcycling community waste for biogas and electricity generation.\n\nThe company has also addressed social challenges through initiatives such as mobile clinics, science libraries, and support for public vocational schools in India. Since 2023, Kia India has been promoting its 'Green Workshop' project, transforming its sales offices into eco-friendly facilities. These facilities are powered by solar panels, optimising water and energy usage, and meeting over 80 per cent of the energy requirements while also powering an EV AC charging unit.

Courtesy of Hyundai Motor Group\n\nBy Lee Min-hyung\n\nHyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Chung Euisun visited India to boost the carmaker's strategic inroads into the country's emerging and highly lucrative electric vehicle (EV) market, the company said Thursday.\n\nChung's visit to India reflects growing economic influences of the region. Last year, India solidified its footing as the world's third-largest car market after the United States and China. More than five million new vehicles were sold in the country in 2023 alone.\n\nThe Indian government is also moving to support overseas EV manufacturers under a plan of expanding its EV sales portion to 30 percent out of total vehicle sales by 2030. The country pledges to drastically cut tariffs on imported EVs, if their manufacturers make investment worth at least $500 million (688 billion won) in India and start producing EVs there within the next three years.\n\nHyundai Motor Group also hopes to achieve the benefit by setting up a mid-to long-term growth strategy there. Toward the end, Hyundai Motor acquired a manufacturing facility in Pune, Maharashtra, last year. The facility is now under renovation with the group's smart manufacturing system. It is forecast to achieve an annual manufacturing capacity of more than 200,000 vehicles upon its completion scheduled for the latter half of 2025.\n\nHyundai Motor also operates a factory in Chennai whose capacity reaches more than 820,000 annually.\n\nKia's production capacity there will also widen to over 430,000 vehicles within the first half of 2024. This will enable the group's two automakers to soon manufacture more than 1.5 million vehicles annually when the operation of their factories goes into full swing.\n\nBoth automakers are also scheduled to launch localized EVs there. According to the group, Hyundai Motor will launch its first locally-manufactured EV sometime in the latter half of this year. The Chennai factory will serve as a hub for the firm's EV production. The automaker plans to launch a total of five EV models by 2030. It also pledged to expand the number of its EV charging stations to 485 by the year.\n\nHyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Chung Euisun, center, poses for a photo with local staff at its regional headquarters in Gurgaon, India, Tuesday. Courtesy of Hyundai Motor Group\n\nKia is also set to start production of its small EV localized for the market in 2025.\n\nChung met with executives and employees from the group's regional headquarters there. More than 3,000 officials took part in the meeting with Chung online and offline.\n\nHe stressed the strategic importance of the country during the hour-long meeting.\n\n\"India has made the biggest contribution to the sustainable growth of Hyundai Motor Group, helping us to achieve solid earnings even during the pandemic era,\" Chung said. \"Hyundai Motor Group is proud that we maintain the position as the second-largest automaker in terms of the market share there by building our premium identity and strengthening brand power.\"", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurgaon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charging station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trucking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/c769c6568eab4720a6f9b8425f252aaf.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507092", "eventUri": "eng-9507092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

By 2030, Hyundai and Kia intend to unveil five new electric models in the Indian market.\n\nIn a previous announcement this month, Hyundai revealed that both Hyundai and Kia would rely on batteries manufactured by Exide Energy Solutions to power their electric vehicles.\n\nIndia stands as Hyundai's largest market outside of North America and Europe.

However, its existing electric models, the Kona and IONIQ 5, are imported, as is Kia's EV6. The new move toward local production represents a strategic shift for the carmakers.\n\nHyundai also reiterated its goal of achieving an annual production capacity of 1 million units by 2025. To meet this target, it plans to expand Kia's capacity from approximately 300,000 to 432,000, bringing the combined capacity of Hyundai and Kia in India to 1.5 million units.\n\nIn an effort to reach these production goals, Hyundai recently completed the acquisition of a former Chevrolet plant in Maharashtra, aiming to increase production capacity.\n\nThese announcements were made during the visit of Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung to India, his second trip to the country in less than a year.\n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

By integrating into a platform familiar to many consumers, Hyundai hopes to strengthen its brand connection and increase visibility among potential buyers.\n\nAndreas-Christoph Hofmann, Vice President of Marketing, Product & PR at Hyundai Motor Europe, emphasized the strategic importance of this initiative. \"Partnering with Amazon allows us to leverage a well-established platform to enhance our customer interactions and meet consumers on their preferred shopping channels,\" he stated.\n\nThe Brand Space is designed to guide customers through Hyundai's offerings seamlessly. It features display advertisements within Amazon that direct users to this specialized area. Here, customers can delve into detailed brand content and explore Hyundai's product range. Additional features include links to local Hyundai websites, where visitors can engage with tools like a digital car configurator or schedule test drives at nearby dealerships.\n\nNils Gr\u00e4f, Managing Director of Amazon Ads in Germany, expressed enthusiasm about expanding Amazon's collaboration with Hyundai in Europe. \"This initiative represents an innovative approach to engaging with prospective customers in a familiar shopping environment, supporting both the brand and local dealerships,\" he noted.\n\nWith this strategic move, Hyundai aims to not only introduce new customers to the brand but also create a more interactive and customer-centric shopping experience online.", "source": {"uri": "carsite.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "carsite.co.za"}, "authors": [{"uri": "breyten_odendaal@carsite.co.za", "name": "Breyten Odendaal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Marketing_Support_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Marketing Support Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://carsite.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/hyundai-launches-first-brand-space-on-amazon-in-europe-to-enhance-digital-customer-interaction.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507092", "eventUri": "eng-9507092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The company cautioned of a challenging business landscape amid escalating competition and uncertain global economic conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, Hyundai Motor Group's Executive Chair Euisun Chung recently visited India, the automaker's second-largest market, to explore mid- and long-term strategic initiatives. Discussions included considerations for an initial public offering (IPO) of its local unit, a move aimed at accelerating expansion in a country where Hyundai has operated for over 25 years and enjoys popularity for its affordable vehicles.\n\nIn contrast to more optimistic projections from its US counterparts such as General Motors and Ford Motor Co, which reported robust profit growth this week driven by steady pricing and demand for gasoline-engine vehicles, Hyundai delivered a cautious outlook and tepid performance on Thursday.\n\n\"We expect competition among automakers to intensify, raising related cost burden... while global macroeconomic uncertainty is also growing. We expect challenging business conditions to continue going forward,\" Hyundai stated in a press release.\n\nHyundai, ranked as the world's third-largest automaker by sales alongside affiliate Kia Corp, witnessed a 1.5 per cent decline in vehicle sales, with a total of 1.007 million units delivered during the first quarter.\n\nThe company faced a stark 16 per cent plunge in domestic sales, South Korea being its second-largest market after the United States. This decline was primarily attributed to consumer struggles amid surging inflation and economic downturns.\n\nHyundai further highlighted that domestic sales were hindered by a temporary halt in production at its Asan plant, currently undergoing revamping for electric vehicle (EV) production.\n\nOn a positive note, vehicle sales in the US market surged by nearly 10 per cent, mirroring the trend among other traditional automakers experiencing robust profit growth.\n\nThe global market witnessed a notable 17 per cent increase in sales of hybrid vehicles, indicating a growing consumer preference for more affordable options over pricier pure electric cars.\n\nHyundai outlined its commitment to expanding its electrified model lineup worldwide by introducing more hybrids and unveiling new IONIQ EV models.\n\nIn February, Reuters reported Hyundai's appointment of investment banks to advise on its anticipated $3 billion India IPO, which is expected to bolster its presence in the Indian market.\n\nEarlier this month, Hyundai and Kia signed a memorandum of understanding with India's Exide Energy Solutions Ltd to supply batteries for their electric vehicles, a move aimed at enhancing competitiveness in the Indian market.\n\nHyundai reported a net profit of 3.2 trillion won ($2.32 billion) for January-March, down from 3.3 trillion won a year earlier but surpassing analysts' average forecast of 3.0 trillion won by LSEG SmartEstimate.\n\nRevenue witnessed a 7.6 per cent increase to 41 trillion won, buoyed by robust overseas sales and a weaker local currency that boosted repatriated earnings.\n\nFollowing the announcement, shares in Hyundai Motor closed down 1.0 per cent, compared to a 1.8 per cent decline in the benchmark KOSPI index.\n\n(With Reuters

We expect challenging business conditions to continue going forward,\" Hyundai said in a statement.\n\nThe world's No.3 automaker by sales along with affiliate Kia Corp sold 1.5% fewer vehicles, delivering 1.007 million units in the first quarter.\n\nSales in South Korea, its second-biggest market after the United States, slumped 16%, as consumers grappled with surging inflation and a weak economy.\n\nHyundai said domestic sales were also impacted by the temporary suspension of production at its Asan plant, which is being revamped for production of electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nVehicle sales in the U.S. market jumped nearly 10%, tracking other legacy automakers that are enjoying strong profit growth.\n\nSales of hybrid vehicles jumped 17% globally, underscoring consumers' growing interest in more affordable vehicles over more expensive pure electric cars that led EV giant Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) to report this month its first vehicle sales drop in nearly four years.\n\nHyundai said it would continue to expand its electrified model lineups globally by introducing more hybrids and new IONIQ EV models.\n\nChief Financial Officer Seung Jo Lee said in an earnings call that the company plans to add equipment to build hybrid vehicles at its EV plant in Georgia and production would start in the second half of this year.\n\n\"While we are currently seeing growing hybrid car demand, Hyundai needs to carefully factor in how long this trend would last and its competitiveness against rivals such as Toyota,\" Shin Yoon chul, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities.\n\nToyota, which relies on hybrids for sales far more than any other major automaker, saw its shares jump 35% this year and is set to report strong quarterly results next month, lifted by robust sales of hybrid models.\n\nWhen asked about the impact of Volkswagen (ETR: VOWG_p )'s Tennessee plant joining the United Auto Workers on Hyundai's U.S. production sites, Hyundai said it currently does not see signs of \"UAW formation\" at its production sites.\n\nHowever, analysts cautioned that the UAW's push at U.S. plants of foreign automakers would likely continue and could result in Hyundai raising wages to prevent workers from joining the union.\n\nFOCUS ON INDIA\n\nAfter a bruising setback in China, hurt by intensifying competition from nimble domestic rivals, Hyundai is now doubling down on India.\n\nHyundai, which was the third-biggest car maker along with Kia in China in 2009, sold just 2,200 cars in the world's biggest auto market last year, a fraction of its total annual sales of 4.2 million units.\n\nIt will launch its first India-made EVs by 2025, Hyundai said on Thursday, as it looks to boost its presence in the nascent space dominated by Tata Motors.\n\nHyundai Motor Group's Executive Chair Euisun Chung visited India, where it is the second biggest automaker and is considering an initial public offering of its local unit, this week to discuss mid- and long-term strategies.\n\nHyundai reported a net profit of 3.2 trillion won ($2.32 billion) for January-March, down from 3.3 trillion won a year earlier, but ahead of an average forecast of 3.0 trillion won by LSEG SmartEstimate.\n\nRevenue rose 7.6% to 41 trillion won, helped by solid overseas sales and as a weaker local currency also boosted repatriated earnings.\n\nShares in Hyundai Motor closed down

The Ioniq 5 is pictured.\n\nSEOUL -- Hyundai Motor Co. warned of intensifying competition and uncertain global economic conditions after posting a 2.4 percent drop in quarterly profit, hit by a domestic sales plunge.\n\nHyundai's cautious outlook and weak performance contrast with bullish forecasts from its U.S. rivals such as General Motors and Ford Motor who this week reported strong profit growth thanks to stable pricing and demand for gasoline-engine vehicles.\n\nHyundai is facing strong near-term headwinds from its shrinking exposure to China and faltering demand in South Korea.\n\n\"We expect competition among automakers to intensify, raising related cost burden... while global macroeconomic uncertainty is also growing. We expect challenging business conditions to continue going forward,\" Hyundai said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe world's No.3 automaker by sales along with affiliate Kia sold 1.5 percent fewer vehicles, delivering just over 1 million units in the first quarter.\n\nSales in South Korea, its second-biggest market after the U.S., slumped 16 percent, as consumers grappled with surging inflation and a weak economy. Domestic sales were also impacted by the temporary suspension of production at its Asan plant, which is being revamped for production of electric vehicles.\n\nVehicle sales in the U.S. jumped nearly 10 percent, tracking other legacy automakers that are enjoying strong growth.\n\nHybrids boost\n\nHyundai said deliveries of battery-powered vehicles accounted for 4.5 percent of its total shipments in the first three months, down from 6.5 percent a year ago. The company's hybrid sales climbed about 17 percent from a year earlier to almost 98,000 units, it said.\n\n\"There was a big decline in EV sales, but those of hybrids -- a high-margin product -- contributed to the high profitability,\" Chief Financial Officer Seung Jo Lee said in an earnings call, pointing to an operating margin of about 9 percent.\n\nStill, the company will continue to spend more on EV incentives that the industry average in order to maintain market share, he said.\n\nHyundai said it would continue to expand its electrified model lineups globally by introducing more hybrids and new Ioniq EV models. It plans to add equipment to build hybrid vehicles at its EV plant in Georgia and production would start in the second half.\n\nThe move to ramp up production of hybrids follows a broad slowdown in demand for EVs, with Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Tesla all reporting lower sales in the early part of the year.\n\nEurope in particular has faced persistent weakness as carmakers contend with higher interest rates, slowing economic growth and fading subsidies for EVs\n\nWhen asked about the impact of Volkswagen's Tennessee plant joining the United Auto Workers on Hyundai's U.S. production sites, Hyundai said it currently does not see signs of \"UAW formation\" at its production sites.\n\nHowever, analysts cautioned that the UAW's push at U.S. plants of foreign automakers would likely continue and could result in Hyundai raising wages to prevent workers from joining the union.\n\nQ1 profit drop\n\nHyundai reported a net profit of 3.2 trillion won ($2.32 billion) for January-March, down from 3.3 trillion won a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.6 percent to 41 trillion won, helped by solid overseas sales and as a weaker local currency also boosted repatriated earnings.\n\nAfter a bruising setback in China, hurt by intensifying competition from nimble domestic rivals, Hyundai is now doubling down on India.\n\nHyundai was the third-biggest carmaker along with Kia in China in 2009 but it sold just 2,200 cars in the world's biggest auto market last year, a fraction of its total annual sales of 4.2 million units.\n\nIt will launch its first India-made EVs by 2025, Hyundai said on Thursday, as it looks to boost its presence in the nascent space dominated by Tata Motors.\n\nHyundai Motor Executive Chair Euisun Chung visited India, where it is the second biggest automaker and is considering an initial public offering of its local unit, this week to discuss mid- and long-term strategies.\n\nBloomberg contributed to this report", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive

The goal of the cooperation is to drive forward material innovations as part of the Hyundai Motor Group's electrification strategy.\n\nAccording to Hyundai, the focus is on developing lightweight and high-strength materials for future vehicles. Using components made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRP) will improve the performance of electric cars - and thus support Hyundai's long-term electrification strategy to \"enhance customer experience and ensure vehicle safety\".\n\nHyundai describes Toray Industries as a specialist in fibres, high-performance chemicals, carbon fibre composites, environmental engineering and life sciences. The Japanese company is already active in electric mobility - together with LG Chem, Toray operates a joint venture based in Hungary for the production of battery separator films. However, Hyundai is not interested in battery components, but in lightweight body construction with carbon fibre parts.\n\nCarbon fibre composites are light, very stable, and characterised by their heat resistance. However, their manufacturing process makes fibre composites much more complex to produce than metal materials. For this reason, the use of carbon fibres - apart from individual projects such as the BMW i3 - has not yet become established in large-scale production.

It's expected to be introduced later this year as Hyundai looks to boost sales in key segments.\n\nThe news comes as several automakers, like Ford, GM, and even sister company Kia, announced similar plans to introduce more hybrids to their lineups.\n\nDespite this, Hyundai's EV sales are still climbing in key markets. Hyundai's EV sales doubled in March in the US, its most important market, with Q1 sales up 62%, also a record.\n\nHyundai Motor America CEO Randy Parker assured, \"Demand for our vehicles, especially EVs, remains high.\" The Korean automaker looks to satisfy the growing demand for hybrids with added production in GA.\n\nHyundai already has some of the cheapest EVs in the US, with the Hyundai Kona Electric (starting under $33,00), the IONIQ 6 (starting at $37,500), and IONIQ 5 (starting at $41,800).", "source": {"uri": "electrek.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Electrek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_johnson@electrek.co", "name": "Peter Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Ioniq_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Ioniq 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Kona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Kona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Recreational_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Recreational Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Hyundai-hybrids-1.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507092", "eventUri": "eng-9507092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

This will reveal which companies are selling the highest number of battery electric vehicles (EVs) and which are achieving the highest share of EVs out of their total sales volume.\n\nThe largest non-Tesla players usually are Hyundai Motor Group (the number one in 2023), Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen Group.\n\nThis report includes 11 traditional manufacturers for which consistent data is available: BMW Group (BMW and Mini, but without data for the Mini Cooper SE model), Ford Group (Ford and Lincoln), General Motors (the BrightDrop delivery van division, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC), Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai, but without data for the Hyundai Kona Electric model, Kia and Genesis), Mazda, Mercedes-Benz (excluding its van division), Nissan, Subaru, Toyota Group (Toyota and Lexus), Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche) and Volvo.\n\nNot all manufacturers report their sales results in the U.S., especially the newer companies like Tesla, Rivian, Polestar, Lucid, Fisker and VinFast. They do not break out sales by country or region so their figures can't be included in this report. They are also 100% electric already.\n\nThe listed 11 traditional automakers delivered more than 102,000 all-electric cars in Q1 2024 in the U.S., about 18% more than a year ago.\n\nLast quarter, only two automotive groups (aside from Tesla) exceeded 20,000 units -- Hyundai Motor Group with at least 22,872 and Ford with 20,223 units. In the case of Hyundai, we say \"at least\" because we don't have the number for the Hyundai Kona Electric model (it's counted together with the gas-powered Kona).\n\nGeneral Motors was third with 16,425 units sold, slightly ahead of the Volkswagen Group (13,128). The small club of manufacturers with 10,000+ units was completed by the BMW Group (10,713). We guess that Rivian potentially also sold more than 10,000 EVs during the quarter, as its global Q1 result was 13,588 and the U.S. is Rivian's single-largest market but we can't confirm that figure.\n\n* Excludes Tesla and other companies for which data was not available\n\n** Hyundai sales without the Hyundai Kona Electric model\n\n*** BMW Group sales without the Mini Cooper SE\n\nOverall, 2024 will be a close race between Hyundai Motor Group, Ford and General Motors (if the ramp-up of Ultium models progresses). The competition might be especially challenging because increasing volume (or even maintaining previous levels) often requires price cuts or deep rebates/leasing incentives.\n\nMeanwhile, in Q4, the highest EV share was achieved by German manufacturers: the Mercedes-Benz brand (excluding vans) at 12.5%, followed by the BMW Group (at least 12.8%) and Volkswagen Group (9.4%).\n\nLet's note that at least for now, this metric remains a bit skewed. Not all brands within particular groups even offer EVs, which lowers the average of the large groups compared to single-brand automakers.\n\nHyundai Motor Group improved its EV share to at least 6.0% (compared to the 5.2% average in 2023). The same concerns Ford at 4.0% (up from 3.6% average in 2023). GM's position is relatively stable under 3%.\n\nVolvo noted the biggest drop, from 10.6% in 12 months of 2023 to just 3.1% in Q1 2024. That's because the company awaits the arrival of the new Volvo EX30 and Volvo EX90 models.\n\n* Excludes Tesla and other OEMs for which data was not available\n\n** Hyundai sales without the Hyundai Kona Electric model\n\nFor reference, the U.S. average EV share for traditional brands might be estimated at over 3% (assuming roughly 7% average EV market share, when including Tesla and other electric-only brands).\n\nStarting in Q2, things will become even more interesting as Stellantis will enter the EV segment with several all-electric models. This will increase the total non-Tesla EV sales to outnumber Tesla.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hyundai has made a strategically important move by offering its most important and most popular electric models for sale in the Chinese market. Preparing to make a difference in the world's largest EV market with the high-performance IONIQ 5 N, Hyundai is also preparing to increase its claim in the SUV segment. In addition to the MUFASA model developed specifically for the Chinese market, it continues to attract attention with its TUCSON and SANTA FE models. TUCSON and SANTA FE models, which have been highly appreciated in China for many years, are also designed to be longer and wider than the European versions in order to meet customer expectations.\n\nIONIQ 5 N, which made a big impact after being introduced at the Goodwood Festival of Speed last year, was recently selected as \"WCOTY - World EV Car of the Year\". Hyundai plans to launch the IONIQ 650 N, which stands out with its 5 horsepower, in China in the second half of the year. Hyundai, which opened its first \"N Special Experience Center\" outside Korea in Shanghai, will thus conduct daily and monthly test drives with potential customers. Hyundai, which wants to develop motor sports culture for N customers in China, will also bring together participants with advanced racing vehicles. In addition, Hyundai N aims to repeat the important successes it achieved in the TCR China Championship last year in the 2024 season.\n\nHyundai will host its visitors at the Beijing Auto Show at a stand covering a total area of 1.208 square meters. Hyundai, which will exhibit a total of 5 models, especially the \"IONIQ 14 N\", will also share its hydrogen technology with visitors. Hyundai, which will showcase the production-storage, transportation-use stages of the hydrogen value chain, will continue to develop adaptable technologies according to the needs of different users as a customized comprehensive hydrogen energy solution. While hydrogen fuel cell systems and the conversion of organic waste back into hydrogen are exhibited at the fairground, Hyundai's commitment to environmentally friendly mobility is also emphasized.\n\nIn addition, Hyundai also signed a memorandum of understanding with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.Limited (CATL) to address China's New Energy Vehicle (NEV) market and increase the brand's competitiveness in electrification.", "source": {"uri": "raillynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RayHaber | RaillyNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Ioniq_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Ioniq 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwood_Festival_of_Speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodwood Festival of Speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CATL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_N", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai N"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Championship_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China Championship (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auto China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorandum of understanding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://rayhaber.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Hyundaiden-Pekin-Otomobil-Fuarinda-Performans-Sovu.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507092", "eventUri": "eng-9507092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Hyundai is the only manufacturer with two vehicles on the list.\n\nThe focus of the Wards 10 Best Interiors and UX competition, is to identify driver interfaces that are user-friendly, navigation systems that are easy to program, and smartphone integration that is simple, allowing drivers safe access to text messages, emails, and phone contacts while on the road.\n\nThe award evaluates the user-friendliness of the driver-assist technologies and the access to information and entertainment options without distraction as well as the vehicles overall interior quality and comfort. The 2024 Hyundai product awards are the second and third product recognitions by WardsAuto since its award inception in 2022. The Hyundai Palisade won in 2023.\n\n\"The 2024 Kona's dual 12.3-inch panoramic display screens offer a versatile interior while the 2024 Santa Fe's spacious interior facilitates urban and outdoor activities,\" said Ricky Lao, director, product planning, Hyundai Motor (OTC:HYMTF) North America. \"At Hyundai, we continue to listen to the customer and push the envelope to create innovative, intuitive and desirable vehicle experiences.\"\n\nAccording to Wards judge, Christie Schweinsberg, \"The Hyundai Kona makes our 2024 Wards 10 Best Interiors & UX list thanks to its cool modernist aesthetic and lots of great technology at a price point, $35,000, that is well below that of the average new-vehicle price in the United States. The 3-row Santa Fe also is an incredible value and the ivory and olive-green geometric interior in the Calligraphy grade we tested is a revolutionary change \" not only for the nameplate, but it rewrites the rule book for the whole industry on vehicle interior design. Thoughtful features like a drawer for second-row passengers, a UV-C sterilization tray for phones and the ability to fold down rear seats from the main screen just add to its appeal.\"\n\nEvaluations of nominated vehicles for the 2024 Wards 10 Best Interiors & UX competition took place in winter and early spring 2024, with judges experiencing the vehicles during their daily driving. Judges rate new or heavily refreshed vehicle interiors and user-experience technology on a variety of metrics including design and aesthetics, comfort, materials, fit-and-finish, connectivity, and infotainment, displays and controls, as well as advanced driver assist system content and value. There is no price cap, but overall value is a consideration. The 2024 Wards 10 Best Interiors & UX awards ceremony will be held on June 6, 2024, during the AutoTech: Detroit Conference, (June 4-6, 2024) at the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi, MI.\n\nHyundai Motor America\n\nHyundai Motor America offers U.S. consumers a technology-rich lineup of cars, SUVs, and electrified vehicles, while supporting Hyundai Motor Company (OTC:HYMLF)'s Progress for Humanity vision. Hyundai has significant operations in the U.S., including its North American headquarters in California, the Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama assembly plant, the all-new Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (in development in Georgia), and several cutting-edge R&D facilities. These operations, combined with those of Hyundai's 835 independent dealers, contribute $20.1 billion annually and 190,000 jobs to the U.S. economy, according to a recent economic impact report.

The company displayed the vision after disclosing a slight fall in its first-quarter operating profit.\n\nIn a regulatory filing, the carmaker reported an operating profit of 3.55 trillion won ($2.58 billion) in the first quarter, down 2.3 percent from the previous year, hit by an overall sales fall. The company, however, generated robust sales of 40.65 trillion won, up 7.6 percent during the same period.\n\nThe company said it will place its management focus on defending its profitability by widening sales for hybrid vehicles and SUVs, at a critical juncture when the global EV industry shows no immediate signs of a rebound.\n\nHyundai Motor Group chief visits India for EV leadership 2024-04-25 13:49 | Companies\n\nThe carmaker also shared its plan to expand investment to widen production of hybrid vehicles.\n\n\"We will make additional equipment investments on our EV-dedicated Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, so the facility can manufacture hybrid cars as well,\" Lee Seung-jo, executive vice president at Hyundai Motor, told investors during the conference call. \"This is in response to growing demand for hybrid vehicles. The facility will start its operation sometime in October.\"\n\nThe carmaker displayed a pessimistic outlook on the overall car industry, as rivalries among existing players deepen and global geopolitical risks show no signs of abating anytime soon.\n\nIn response, the company reiterated its strong willingness to improve its product mix by strengthening its hybrid vehicle portfolio and diversifying its IONIQ EV lineup.\n\nThe carmaker sold a total of 1.67 million vehicles here and abroad between January and March, down 1.5 percent from the previous year. Its domestic sales reached 159,967, down 16.3 percent from a year earlier, in the aftermath of a temporary shutdown of its production line in Asan, South Chungcheong Province.\n\nBut overseas sales growth helped offset the sluggish performance here. The carmaker chalked up 846,800 vehicle sales in the first quarter, up 1.9 percent from the previous year, on favorable responses from territories such as North America, Europe and India, according to the company.\n\n\"Even if we face continuous uncertainties in our management environment amid geopolitical risks -- sparked by conflicts in the Middle East -- and its subsequent impact on the won-dollar exchange rate which has recently widened its volatility, Hyundai Motor still maintains a stable level of profitability on demand growth from our major overseas markets,\" an official from the carmaker said.\n\n\"We will keep focusing on defending our profitability by improving our product mix with the focus on SUVs and other value-added vehicles.\"", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Chungcheong_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Chungcheong Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Chungcheong Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Asan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trucking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Financial Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/2097907d50964055adb9a39115c21c28.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507092", "eventUri": "eng-9507092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

This recognition marks a significant milestone for Hyundai, distinguishing it as the sole manufacturer to have two vehicles featured on this prestigious list. The awards spotlight the paramount importance of user-friendly driver interfaces, straightforward navigation systems, and seamless smartphone integration, ensuring drivers maintain focus while accessing essential functions.\n\nThe evaluation process for the Wards 10 Best Interiors and UX awards focuses on the ease of use regarding driver-assist technologies, as well as the quality and comfort of the vehicle's interior. The 2024 models of both the Santa Fe and Kona stood out in these categories, with the Santa Fe being showcased in California City, Calif., on November 15, 2023, and again on November 16, 2023. These accolades follow Hyundai's previous success in 2023 when the Hyundai Palisade was recognized by WardsAuto.\n\nRicky Lao, director of product planning at Hyundai Motor North America, expressed pride in the company's achievements. \"At Hyundai, we continue to listen to the customer and push the envelope to create innovative, intuitive and desirable vehicle experiences,\" he stated. The 2024 Kona's dual 12.3-inch panoramic display screens and the Santa Fe's spacious interior exemplify Hyundai's commitment to enhancing user experience through thoughtful design and technology.\n\nChristie Schweinsberg, a judge for WardsAuto, praised the Hyundai Kona for its modernist aesthetic and advanced technology at an accessible price point of $35,000. The Santa Fe was lauded for its innovative interior design in the Calligraphy grade tested by WardsAuto judges, featuring an ivory and olive-green geometric interior that sets a new standard for vehicle interior design across the industry. Additional features such as a second-row passenger drawer, a UV-C sterilization tray for phones, and rear seats that fold down via the main screen further contributed to its appeal.\n\nThe selection process for the 2024 Wards 10 Best Interiors & UX competition involved rigorous evaluations during winter and early spring of 2024. Judges based their decisions on various criteria including design aesthetics, comfort, material quality, connectivity, infotainment systems, and overall value. The awards ceremony is scheduled to take place on June 6, 2024, during the AutoTech: Detroit Conference at the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi, MI.\n\nHyundai Motor America plays a crucial role in supporting Hyundai Motor Company's vision of Progress for Humanity.

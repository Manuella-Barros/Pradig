With the Dodgers listed as a road favorite and the total sitting at 12 runs, what's the best bet tonight from Denver?\n\nAs of this writing, our MLB Public Betting Page shows that 88% of bets are on the Dodgers' moneyline. That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers DFS SPIN\n\nThe Dodgers improved to 44-29 after beating the Royals 3-0 yesterday. Shohei Ohtani had a big game, hitting two solo home runs in the victory. Despite the victory, the Dodgers suffered a major blow as Mookie Betts left the game in the seventh inning after getting hit in the left wrist area. Betts was placed on the injured list on Monday with a hand fracture.\n\nColorado Rockies DFS SPIN\n\nThe Rockies dropped to 25-46 for the year after yesterday's loss. Jacob Stallings had a nice game despite the loss going 2-4 and scoring both of Colorado's runs. The Rockies look to get back in the win column against LA on Monday.\n\nThe Dodgers are 7-3 SU in their last 10 games against Colorado.\n\nThe total has gone under in 3 of the last 5 home games for the Rockies.\n\nDodgers vs. Rockies MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake the Dodgers on the run line. I know LA will be without Betts, but they still be okay without him against a Rockies team that sits at 25-46 for the season. LA still has plenty of firepower to take it to the Rockies, if Paxon can deliver a decent start. The Rockies have caught some steam, but I disagree, I think it is all Dodgers tonight.", "source": {"uri": "thespread.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSpread.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_elliot@thespread.com", "name": "Paul Elliot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Stallings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Stallings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.thespread.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-dodgers-ohtani02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Our MLB odds series has our Dodgers-Rockies prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nThe Dodgers make the trip to Denver to face the Rockies! The Dodgers have been one of the best teams in the MLB, while the Rockies have been one of the worst. The Dodgers are also playing better than the Rockies entering this series. Our MLB odds series has our Dodgers-Rockies prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched five innings and gave up three runs on seven hits with one walk and two strikeouts in a Dodgers loss.\n\nLast Start: Pitched three innings and gave up eight runs on 11 hits with one walk and two strikeouts in a Rockies loss.\n\nThe Dodgers were the team with all of the expectations heading into this season. They have a 44-29 record so far and have been good, but were expected to be even better than they have been. Their offense is a top-three unit, while their pitching is a top-five unit in the MLB. On offense, there are stars with Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Teoscar Hernandez, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Max Muncy. Their pitching is then led by Tyler Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and Gavin Stone on the mound.\n\nThe Dodgers are starting Walker Buehler on the mound where he has a 1-4 record, a 4.64 ERA, and a 1.45 WHIP. Through 33 innings, Buehler has allowed 20 runs on 39 hits with nine walks and 29 strikeouts. The Dodgers are 3-4 in the seven games that he has started in this season. Buehler has struggled when compared to the rest of the starting lineup as a pitcher for the Dodgers. This will be a difficult matchup with how surprisingly well the Rockies have played on offense this season.\n\nThe Dodgers have the most talent on offense in the MLB, and they are sitting with a .258 batting average, which is third in the MLB. This is after they finished with a .257 batting average last year before they had a massive offseason by picking up a lot of talent in free agency. Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Teoscar Hernandez lead the way in the important batting categories. Ohtani leads in batting average at .309 and in home runs at 19. Betts was injured recently, but still leads in OBP at .405 and in total hits at 86. Finally, Hernandez leads in RBI at 50. Gomber has been inconsistent for the Rockies, so the Dodgers have a favorable matchup with him on the mound.\n\nWhy The Rockies Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Rockies are one of the worst teams in the MLB this season. They are 25-46 this season and have lost three out of their last four games. Their bats have been excellent this season, and rank just outside the top 10, but they have the worst pitching staff in the MLB by a wide margin. Brendan Rodgers, Ryan McMahon, Ezequiel Tovar, Brenton Doyle, and Elias Diaz have all been solid for the Rockies behind the plate. Cal Quantrill and Austin Gomber have been okay at best for a unit that has struggled this season. The Rockies' offense has improved, but their pitching has been terrible and is a massive reason why they have struggled so much this year.\n\nThe Rockies are starting Austin Gomber on the mound. He has a 1-4 record, a 4.26 ERA, and a 1.32 WHIP. He has allowed 34 runs on 70 hits with 22 walks and 49 strikeouts through 69.2 innings. The Rockies are only 5-8 in the 13 starts this season. Gomber has been a bright spot for the Rockies but has struggled with consistency on the mound. This is a tough matchup for him against the Dodgers because of all their talent behind the plate, despite the Betts injury.\n\nThe Rockies' offense has been a bright spot, especially recently. They are 11th in team batting average at .249 after finishing last season with the same average. The offense is led by Ryan McMahon and Ezequiel Tovar. McMahon leads the way in home runs at 12, in RBI at 37, and in OBP at .344. Then, Tovar leads the way in batting average at .290 and total hits at 85. They get a favorable matchup against Walker Buehler, who has been the weak link in a great Dodgers pitching staff, especially with this game at home.\n\nFinal Dodgers-Rockies Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Rockies have the pitching advantage in this game with Gomber, compared to Buehler for the Dodgers. Los Angeles has the advantage behind the plate, but it's closer than most think. This should be a close game, so expect the Rockies to cover at home, even if the Dodgers eventually win outright.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"},

Shortstop Mookie Betts suffered a fractured left hand when he was hit by a pitch in the seventh inning in Sunday's 3-0 win over Kansas City. The 2018 American League MVP will join Muncy and Yamamoto on the Dodgers' injured list but won't need surgery, the team announced.\n\nDespite that, Los Angeles securely is in first place in the National League West and will look to add to its lead on Monday when it opens a four-game series against the Colorado Rockies in Denver.\n\nThe Dodgers will send left-hander James Paxton (6-1, 3.92 ERA) to the mound on Monday against Colorado right-hander Cal Quantrill (6-4, 3.30).\n\nLos Angeles has dropped four of its past seven games and heads to Denver trying to continue its dominance of the Rockies. The Dodgers have won 16 of the past 23 games between the NL West rivals, including taking two of three in Los Angeles on May 31-June 2.\n\nTaylor has had success against Colorado, batting .274 with 17 home runs in 93 games. He has struggled to get started this season, however, as he is batting .108 and didn't hit his first home run until Friday night. The veteran is trying to keep perspective as he works through his struggles.\n\n\"I try to just take it day by day,\" Taylor said. \"I've definitely had my moments of frustration, but just trying to embrace the process and trust that my work is going to eventually come through for me.\"\n\nPaxton is having a bounce-back season, his first with the Dodgers, and will face the Rockies for the sixth time in his career. He is 1-3 with a 3.65 ERA in his previous five starts against them.\n\nColorado, coming off an 8-2 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday, has been successful against winning teams at home. The Rockies swept the Texas Rangers in May and won series against the Cleveland Guardians and Philadelphia Phillies in the past six weeks.\n\nQuantrill has been a factor in Colorado's turnaround from an 8-28 start. He lost his first three decisions but has bounced back to go 6-1 since the start of May. His one loss in the stretch was at Los Angeles on June 1 when he allowed four runs in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nHe has struggled against the Dodgers in his career, going 1-4 with a 7.89 ERA in five appearances (four starts).\n\nThe Rockies have been up and down offensively, scoring 16 runs Saturday night but managing just four total in the other two games against Pittsburgh. A positive out of Sunday's loss was the three hits by Nolan Jones, who finished the series 4-for-8 after missing six weeks with a low back strain.\n\n\"Hopefully this is a good sign,\" manager Bud Black said. \"We need Nolan to be a big part of our lineup.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Dodgers score 7 runs in the ninth to stun Rockies 11-9 at Coors Field", "body": "Jason Heyward hit a pinch-hit grand slam and Teoscar Hernandez added a three-run homer -- all in a seven-run ninth inning -- as the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied for an 11-9 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night.\n\nJason Heyward hit a pinch-hit grand slam and Teoscar Hernandez added a three-run homer -- all in a seven-run ninth inning -- as the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied for a wild 11-9 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night.\n\n\"It was quality of at-bat up and down the lineup,\" Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said. \"Jason was ready when called upon. Teo, he keeps coming up with big hits. That inning, certainly, the results showed the fight, the compete.\"\n\nHeyward's fourth career grand slam came off Tyler Kinley and followed walks by Andy Pages and Miguel Vargas around a single by Miguel Rojas. Heyward's fourth homer of the season hit the right field foul pole and pulled the Dodgers within 9-8 with one out in the inning after they trailed 7-2 after four.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if it was going to stay fair or not,\" said Heyward, who hit an inside slider, \"It's Colorado, so maybe that helped it straighten out a little bit. I was like, 'Come on, squeak in, squeak in.' I honestly feel like we got rewarded for our process\" in the ninth.\n\nShohei Ohtani, who had a 476-foot homer in the fifth, singled off Victor Vodnik (1-1) before Will Smith struck out looking after attempting to step out of the batter's box on a 3-2 pitch.\n\nAfter a wild pitch, Freddie Freeman received an intentional walk, his sixth walk in the last two games, bringing up Hernandez. Hernandez took a half-swing at a 1-2 fastball and first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that Hernandez did not commit. Colorado manager Bud Black argued the call and was ejected.\n\nOn the next pitch, Hernandez hit his 18th home to make it 11-9.\n\nAfter Hernandez's ball cleared the wall, Colorado right field Jake Cave immediately took a few steps toward Barksdale and began yelling. Rockies' second baseman Alan Trejo stepped between Cave and Barksdale after the inning ended.\n\n\"It was close,\" Hernandez said. \"You can call it either way and it will be fine. When Jason hit the grand slam and turning the lineup over to Ohtani, you know something was going to happen. I just wanted to get a good pitch hit to tie the game. I put a little extra and it went over the fence. I knew as soon as I hit. It was great, especially because it put the team ahead.\"\n\nEvan Phillips got the only batter he faced, Hunter Goodman, with a runner on second to record his 11th save in as many chances. Cave, the on-deck hitter, was restrained by bench Mike Redmond as he attempted to reach Barksdale after the game ended.\n\n\"When I'm running in (before the last of the ninth), he looks me right in the face and goes, 'Cave, it's not even close,'\" Cave said. \"Everybody in the world could see it was at least close. And he did swing. It's a big game, it's one of the best teams in baseball and we're battling with them.\n\n\"That game's won on that swing, That's a swing-and-miss, the game's won, and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.\"\n\nElehuris Montero and Brenton Doyle homered for the Rockies, who scored four runs in the first and twice led by five runs.\n\nDoyle added three singles for his first career four-hit game, scored twice, and made a diving catch of Ohtani's line drive to right-center field with runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh inning, preserving an 8-4 lead.\n\nDodgers starter Walker Buehler gave up eight hits and seven runs in four innings. It was the first time the 29-yeaer-old right-hander allowed more than three earned runs since returning to the rotation May 6 after missing the 2023 season because of Tommy John surgery. He struck out two and walked one.\n\nPages also homered for the Dodgers, who have won four of five and are 73-32 against Colorado since 2018. The Rockies have lost five of six.\n\nMichael Petersen (1-0) worked two innings of relief and struck out two in his major league debut.\n\n\"It was crazy,\" said Petersen, whose relatives were in attendance. \"You can't feel anything. It's like your first date, you are tripping over stuff. But awesome.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (shoulder surgery) is scheduled to pitch three innings for Class A Rancho Cucamonga on Wednesday in his first rehab start of the season. \"He's doing fantastic,\" manager Dave Roberts said, adding that Kershaw will follow the natural progression of two or three more rehab starts \"and then we'll see where we are at.\"\n\nRockies: DH/OF Charlie Blackmon (right hamstring tightness) was removed after suffering his injury while running the bases in the first. ... LHP Kyle Freeland (elbow strain) gave up two hits and two runs and struck out four in four innings of a rehab start for Triple-A Albuquerque on Tuesday and appears close to returning. ... 2B Brendan Rodgers (hamstring) did normal pregame work Tuesday and is expected to begin a rehab assignment on Thursday with an eye toward a weekend activation. ... OF Sean Bouchard (ankle) led off and was 1 for 3 with two walks as the DH for Albuquerque.\n\nNEXT UP\n\nDodgers RHP Bobby Miller (1-1, 5.40 ERA) will oppose Rockies RHP Ryan Feltner (1-6, 5.71) in the third game of a four-game series. Miller will make his fourth start, his first since April 10, after missing nine weeks with right shoulder inflammation. He won in his only previous appearance at Coors Field, 7-2, on Sept. 26, 2023.", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern California"}, "authors": [],

Los Angeles on Monday opens a three-game series against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field where Shohei Ohtani and his fellow Dodgers can set a tone for how they'll look without their star leadoff man.\n\nBetMGM likes the Dodgers to come out strong, and has them favored in a game where a ton of runs are expected to score. Here's what the lines look like with James Paxton starting on the mound for LA against Cal Quantrill:\n\nQuantrill has been really good for the Rockies lately. In his last two starts he's gone 11.0 shutout innings, allowing six hits while walking five and striking out six. His last bad outing came against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium though when LA touched him up for four runs on nine hits in 4.1 innings.

The game was three outs away from being over.\n\nOf course, that's when they finally came alive.\n\nThe Dodgers, behind two massive home runs from Jayson Heyward and Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, pulled off a ridiculous rally to claim an 11-9 win over the Colorado Rockies. They put up seven runs in the ninth inning alone to escape with the win.\n\nFirst, after loading up the bases in the ninth inning, it was Heyward who drilled a grand slam with his deep shot off the right field foul pole. That suddenly cut the deficit down to just a single run.\n\nThen, with two outs and two strikes on him, Hern\u00e1ndez followed suit. He hit a three-run home run himself to put the Dodgers in the lead for the first time all night.\n\nFrom there, the Dodgers quickly shut down the Rockies in the bottom of the inning to officially grab the win.\n\nThe Dodgers entered the ninth inning with four runs on the board, thanks largely to star Shohei Ohtani. He had two hits, two RBI and a deep solo home run in the sixth inning -- which traveled a season-record 476 feet into center field off of Rockies pitcher Austin Gomber.\n\nOhtani now has 20 home runs and 91 hits and 49 RBI on the year.\n\nThe win marked the Dodgers' fourth in their last five games and second straight over the Rockies.

Teo, he keeps coming up with big hits. That inning, certainly, the results showed the fight, the compete.\"\n\nHeyward's fourth career grand slam came off Tyler Kinley and followed walks by Andy Pages and Miguel Vargas around a single by Miguel Rojas. Heyward's fourth homer of the season hit the right field foul pole and pulled the Dodgers within 9-8 with one out in the inning after they trailed 7-2 after four.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if it was going to stay fair or not,\" said Heyward, who hit an inside slider, \"It's Colorado, so maybe that helped it straighten out a little bit. I was like, 'Come on, squeak in, squeak in.' I honestly feel like we got rewarded for our process\" in the ninth.\n\nShohei Ohtani, who had a 476-foot homer in the fifth, singled off Victor Vodnik (1-1) before Will Smith struck out looking after attempting to step out of the batter's box on a 3-2 pitch.\n\nAfter a wild pitch, Freddie Freeman received an intentional walk, his sixth walk in the last two games, bringing up Hernandez. Hernandez took a half-swing at a 1-2 fastball and first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that Hernandez did not commit. Colorado manager Bud Black argued the call and was ejected.\n\nOn the next pitch, Hernandez hit his 18th home to make it 11-9.\n\nAfter Hernandez's ball cleared the wall, Colorado right field Jake Cave immediately took a few steps toward Barksdale and began yelling. Rockies' second baseman Alan Trejo stepped between Cave and Barksdale after the inning ended.\n\n\"It was close,\" Hernandez said. \"You can call it either way and it will be fine. When Jason hit the grand slam and turning the lineup over to Ohtani, you know something was going to happen. I just wanted to get a good pitch hit to tie the game. I put a little extra and it went over the fence. I knew as soon as I hit. It was great, especially because it put the team ahead.\"\n\nEvan Phillips got the only batter he faced, Hunter Goodman, with a runner on second to record his 11th save in as many chances. Cave, the on-deck hitter, was restrained by bench Mike Redmond as he attempted to reach Barksdale after the game ended.\n\n\"When I'm running in (before the last of the ninth), he looks me right in the face and goes, 'Cave, it's not even close,'\" Cave said. \"Everybody in the world could see it was at least close. And he did swing. It's a big game, it's one of the best teams in baseball and we're battling with them.\n\n\"That game's won on that swing, That's a swing-and-miss, the game's won, and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.\"\n\nElehuris Montero and Brenton Doyle homered for the Rockies, who scored four runs in the first and twice led by five runs.\n\nDoyle added three singles for his first career four-hit game, scored twice, and made a diving catch of Ohtani's line drive to right-center field with runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh inning, preserving an 8-4 lead.\n\nDodgers starter Walker Buehler gave up eight hits and seven runs in four innings. It was the first time the 29-yeaer-old right-hander allowed more than three earned runs since returning to the rotation May 6 after missing the 2023 season because of Tommy John surgery. He struck out two and walked one.\n\nPages also homered for the Dodgers, who have won four of five and are 73-32 against Colorado since 2018. The Rockies have lost five of six.\n\nMichael Petersen (1-0) worked two innings of relief and struck out two in his major league debut.\n\n\"It was crazy,\" said Petersen, whose relatives were in attendance. \"You can't feel anything.

Heyward's fourth homer of the season hit the right-field foul pole and pulled the Dodgers within 9-8 with one out in the inning after they had trailed 7-2 after four.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if it was going to stay fair or not,\" said Heyward, who hit an inside slider. \"It's Colorado, so maybe that helped it straighten out a little bit. I was like, 'Come on, squeak in, squeak in.' I honestly feel like we got rewarded for our process\" in the ninth.\n\nShohei Ohtani, who had a 476-foot homer in the fifth, singled off Victor Vodnik (1-1) before Will Smith struck out looking after attempting to step out of the batter's box on a 3-2 pitch.\n\nAfter a wild pitch, Freddie Freeman received an intentional walk, his sixth walk in the past two games, bringing up Hernandez. Hernandez took a half-swing at a 1-2 fastball and first-base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that Hernandez did not commit. Colorado Manager Bud Black argued the call and was ejected.\n\nOn the next pitch, Hernandez hit his 18th homer to make it 11-9.\n\nAfter Hernandez's ball cleared the wall, Colorado right fielder Jake Cave immediately took a few steps toward Barksdale and began yelling. Rockies' second baseman Alan Trejo stepped between Cave and Barksdale after the inning ended.\n\n\"It was close,\" Hernandez said. \"You can call it either way and it will be fine. When Jason hit the grand slam and turning the lineup over to Ohtani, you know something was going to happen. I just wanted to get a good pitch to hit to tie the game. I put a little extra and it went over the fence. I knew as soon as I hit it. It was great, especially because it put the team ahead.\"\n\nEvan Phillips got the only batter he faced, Hunter Goodman, with a runner on second to record his 11th save in as many chances. Cave, the on-deck hitter, was restrained by bench coach Mike Redmond as he attempted to reach Barksdale after the game ended.\n\n\"When I'm running in [before the last of the ninth], he looks me right in the face and goes, 'Cave, it's not even close,'\" Cave said. \"Everybody in the world could see it was at least close. And he did swing. It's a big game. It's one of the best teams in baseball and we're battling with them.\n\n\"That game's won on that swing, That's a swing-and-miss, the game's won, and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.\"\n\nElehuris Montero and Brenton Doyle homered for the Rockies, who scored four runs in the first and twice led by five runs.\n\nDoyle added three singles for his first career four-hit game, scored twice, and made a diving catch of Ohtani's line drive to right-center field with runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh inning, preserving an 8-4 lead.\n\nDodgers starter Walker Buehler gave up seven runs on eight hits in four innings. It was the first time the 29-year-old right-hander allowed more than three earned runs since returning to the rotation May 6 after missing the 2023 season because of Tommy John surgery. He struck out two and walked one.\n\nPages also homered for the Dodgers, who have won four of their past five games and are 73-32 against Colorado since 2018. The Rockies have lost five of their past six.\n\nThe Dodgers' Michael Petersen (1-0) worked two innings of relief and struck out two in his major league debut.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com",

It was a deficit the Dodgers hadn't overcome in nearly 70 years entering the final inning, but Jason Heyward and Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez helped them achieve a rare feat.\n\nHeyward pinch-hit for Chris Taylor and pulled a grand slam to right field that hit off the foul pole and cut the Dodgers' deficit to one run. The Rockies then turned to Victor Vodnik, who gave up a single to Shohei Ohtani and intentionally walked Freddie Freeman before striking out Will Smith.\n\nVodnik had the Rockies one strike away from hanging on for a win, and appeared to get that but first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled Hern\u00e1ndez did not go around on his check-swing. Hern\u00e1ndez then drove the next pitch out to right-center field for a game-winning home run.\n\nHeyward's grand slam and Hern\u00e1ndez's home run helped the Dodgers make MLB history for the ninth inning.\n\nWhile the Rockies certainly left unhappy with the call that allowed Hern\u00e1ndez to stay alive in the count, they could have avoided the situation entirely by recording three outs before the Dodgers were in a position to make history and take the lead behind a furious rally.\n\nThe comeback was reminiscent of Andrew Toles hitting a go-ahead grand slam in the ninth inning of a 2016 game at Coors Field.\n\nDodgers comeback makes franchise history\n\nManager Dave Roberts was impressed with the way the team was able to climb back from such a steep deficit so late in the game to steal a victory away from the Rockies, which amounted to franchise history.\n\nTuesday's game represented the biggest ninth-inning comeback in Dodgers history since 1957 and their first time overcoming a five-run deficit in the final frame without going to extras since 1929.", "source": {"uri": "dodgerblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Though they sit in first place, well ahead of the rest of the National League West, the Dodgers lost superstar shortstop Mookie Betts for at least 6-8 weeks after he was hit in the hand by a 98mph fastball on Sunday.\n\nThat came one day after losing rookie phenom Yoshinobu Yamamoto for an undetermined amount of time with a strained rotator cuff. But if there's one thing the modern Dodgers have excelled at, it's building depth to sustain injury issues. And that depth was on full display in a crazy, wild, insane finish during Tuesday night's game in Denver against the Colorado Rockies. Oh, and they also benefited from a controversial no-call on a checked swing.\n\nAfter a rocky start from Walker Buehler, it seemed like the Rockies would cruise to an easy win. Even after a mammoth 476-foot home run from Shohei Ohtani.\n\nThe Rockies then got a remarkable diving catch from Brenton Doyle in center field to save two runs in the 7th inning, robbing Ohtani of a double into the gap.\n\nThey added on another run, taking a 9-4 lead into the top of the 9th inning. That's when things quickly went haywire.\n\nAndy Pages walked, Miguel Rojas hit a bloop single to center, and Miguel Vargas walked after a Kik\u00e9 Hernandez strikeout. That led to a Jason Heyward pinch-hit grand slam off the foul pole.\n\nThat made Shohei Ohtani the tying run at the plate, and he promptly banged a single the opposite way. A wild pitch, strikeout and intentional walk to Freddie Freeman put runners at first and second with two out. That's when the controversy started.\n\nTeoscar Hernandez appeared to have gone around on a 1-2 pitch, but first base umpire Lance Barksdale, to the despair of the Rockies bench, said he didn't go.\n\nThe very next pitch, Hernandez launched a three-run homer to right center field.\n\nThanks to the reprieve on the checked swing, the Dodgers were able to score seven runs in the ninth inning to win 11-9 after trailing 9-4 entering the inning. Only the Rockies.\n\nDebate over the checked swing seems to be pretty evenly split. The rule is open to interpretation, and while that type of checked swing is usually called a strike, it's a 50/50 call. Rockies fans think he went, Dodgers fans think he didn't.\n\nThe only opinion that mattered though, was Barksdale's, and it led directly to one of the most remarkable comebacks you'll ever see. The win pushed the Dodgers to 46-29 and cemented a commanding nine game lead over the second place Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nLose Mookie Betts? Rely on Jason Heyward and Teoscar Hernandez to deliver.

That allowed the Dodgers to cruise while exhibiting some offensive patience in a 9-5 win over the Rockies in Monday night's series opener in Denver.\n\nJust about everything was working for Paxton, who struck out a season-best eight batters in a season-hight seven innings, retiring 21 of his 25 batters faced. The lone run against him was a solo homer by Jacob Stallings in the second inning, an aptly named batter since his home run interrupted Kirsten Watson explaining the Dodgers city connect uniforms on the SportsNet LA broadcast.\n\nPaxton found success by pounding the strike zone, completing his seven innings in just 91 pitches, and continued a trend over the last month and a half.\n\nThe left-hander led the world with 22 walks during an April, with a 19.3-percent walk rate that was so far out of line with Paxton's career norms. But since then, after some mechanical fixes, he has been able to limit the free passes, with just a 6.67-percent walk rate in his last eight starts.\n\nThat stinginess allowed Paxton to complete at least six innings five times in his last eight starts.\n\nPaxton's only walk on Monday came with two outs in the seventh inning, and Paxton got three strikeouts in that frame to keep the walk from hurting him. He induced 15 swinging strikes against the Rockies, also a season high.\n\nNobody against Paxton, outside of maybe Stallings in the batters box with the bases empty, batted with a runner in scoring position on Monday.\n\nOn the other side, Rockies starter Cal Quantrill really had to work to get through his night. The Dodgers had runners on in every inning against him, and got him out of the game after five innings and 99 pitches. Eleven batters reached base against Quantrill alone, but the Dodgers had to scratch and claw to plate the three runs they did score with him in the game.\n\nAll three runs against Quantrill came in the first two innings, all scored on two-out, two-strike hits. Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez opened the scoring by winning a 10-pitch battle with an RBI double in the first inning to score Freddie Freeman.\n\nIn the second inning, Shohei Ohtani singled home Miguel Rojas, then No. 2 hitter Will Smith tripled home Ohtani.\n\nThe fruits of that early labor paid off for the Dodgers against the Rockies bullpen, as they threatened in the final four innings as well. Rojas doubled home a run in the seventh, his third hit of the night in his first game since assuming the role of regular shortstop. Cavan Biggio singled home Rojas for his frist RBI in five games with the Dodgers.\n\nJason Heyward also had three hits, including a two-run single in the eighth that provided more insurance.\n\nTwo more runs came in the ninth, including a double by Gavin Lux, the Dodgers' sixth extra-base hit of the night.\n\nFreeman had an interesting night, tying a Dodgers record with five walks, the last of which was intentional. He broke that streak with a ninth-inning single. I'll write more about his game later.\n\nThe final score was not an accurate portrayal of how close the game was, as the Rockies pounded four extra-base hits and scored four runs in the ninth against J.P. Feyereisen.\n\nWalker Buehler takes the mound for the Dodgers on Tuesday (5:40 p.m. PT, SportsNet LA), with with left-hander Austin Gomber starting for the Rockies there's a good chance the newly-recalled Miguel Vargas will start in left field.", "source": {"uri": "truebluela.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "True Blue LA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_stephen@truebluela.com", "name": "Eric Stephen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paxton_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Paxton (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Stallings", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Stallings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Feyereisen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Teo, he keeps coming up with big hits. That inning, certainly, the results showed the fight, the compete.\"\n\nHeyward's fourth career grand slam came off Tyler Kinley and followed walks by Andy Pages and Miguel Vargas around a single by Miguel Rojas. Heyward's fourth homer of the season hit the right field foul pole and pulled the Dodgers within 9-8 with one out in the inning after they trailed 7-2 after four.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if it was going to stay fair or not,\" said Heyward, who hit an inside slider, \"It's Colorado, so maybe that helped it straighten out a little bit. I was like, 'Come on, squeak in, squeak in.' I honestly feel like we got rewarded for our process\" in the ninth.\n\nShohei Ohtani, who had a 476-foot homer in the fifth, singled off Victor Vodnik (1-1) before Will Smith struck out looking after attempting to step out of the batter's box on a 3-2 pitch.\n\nAfter a wild pitch, Freddie Freeman received an intentional walk, his sixth walk in the last two games, bringing up Hernandez. Hernandez took a half-swing at a 1-2 fastball and first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that Hernandez did not commit. Colorado manager Bud Black argued the call and was ejected.\n\nOn the next pitch, Hernandez hit his 18th home to make it 11-9.\n\nAfter Hernandez's ball cleared the wall, Colorado right field Jake Cave immediately took a few steps toward Barksdale and began yelling. Rockies' second baseman Alan Trejo stepped between Cave and Barksdale after the inning ended.\n\n\"It was close,\" Hernandez said. \"You can call it either way and it will be fine. When Jason hit the grand slam and turning the lineup over to Ohtani, you know something was going to happen. I just wanted to get a good pitch hit to tie the game. I put a little extra and it went over the fence. I knew as soon as I hit. It was great, especially because it put the team ahead.\"\n\nEvan Phillips got the only batter he faced, Hunter Goodman, with a runner on second to record his 11th save in as many chances. Cave, the on-deck hitter, was restrained by bench Mike Redmond as he attempted to reach Barksdale after the game ended.\n\n\"When I'm running in (before the last of the ninth), he looks me right in the face and goes, 'Cave, it's not even close,'\" Cave said. \"Everybody in the world could see it was at least close. And he did swing. It's a big game, it's one of the best teams in baseball and we're battling with them.\n\n\"That game's won on that swing, That's a swing-and-miss, the game's won, and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.\"\n\nElehuris Montero and Brenton Doyle homered for the Rockies, who scored four runs in the first and twice led by five runs.\n\nDoyle added three singles for his first career four-hit game, scored twice, and made a diving catch of Ohtani's line drive to right-center field with runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh inning, preserving an 8-4 lead.\n\nDodgers starter Walker Buehler gave up eight hits and seven runs in four innings. It was the first time the 29-yeaer-old right-hander allowed more than three earned runs since returning to the rotation May 6 after missing the 2023 season because of Tommy John surgery. He struck out two and walked one.\n\nPages also homered for the Dodgers, who have won four of five and are 73-32 against Colorado since 2018. The Rockies have lost five of six.\n\nMichael Petersen (1-0) worked two innings of relief and struck out two in his major league debut.\n\n\"It was crazy,\" said Petersen, whose relatives were in attendance. \"You can't feel anything. It's like your first date, you are tripping over stuff. But awesome.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (shoulder surgery) is scheduled to pitch three innings for Class A Rancho Cucamonga on Wednesday in his first rehab start of the season. \"He's doing fantastic,\" manager Dave Roberts said, adding that Kershaw will follow the natural progression of two or three more rehab starts \"and then we'll see where we are at.\"\n\nRockies: DH/OF Charlie Blackmon (right hamstring tightness) was removed after suffering his injury while running the bases in the first. ... LHP Kyle Freeland (elbow strain) gave up two hits and two runs and struck out four in four innings of a rehab start for Triple-A Albuquerque on Tuesday and appears close to returning. ... 2B Brendan Rodgers (hamstring) did normal pregame work Tuesday and is expected to begin a rehab assignment on Thursday with an eye toward a weekend activation. ... OF Sean Bouchard (ankle) led off and was 1 for 3 with two walks as the DH for Albuquerque.\n\nNEXT UP\n\nDodgers RHP Bobby Miller (1-1, 5.40 ERA) will oppose Rockies RHP Ryan Feltner (1-6, 5.71) in the third game of a four-game series. Miller will make his fourth start, his first since April 10, after missing nine weeks with right shoulder inflammation. He won in his only previous appearance at Coors Field, 7-2, on Sept. 26, 2023.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro

Heyward's fourth homer of the season pulled the Dodgers within 9-8 with one out in the inning after trailing 7-2 after four innings.\n\nShohei Ohtani, who had a 476-foot homer in the fifth, singled off Victor Vodnik (1-1) before Will Smith struck out looking after attempting to step out of the batter's box on a 3-2 pitch.\n\nAfter a wild pitch, Freddie Freeman received an intentional walk, his sixth walk in the last two games, bringing up Hernandez. Hernandez took a half-swing at a 1-2 fastball, but first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that Hernandez did not commit. Colorado manager Bud Black argued the call and was ejected.\n\nOn the next pitch, Hernandez hit his 18th home to make it 11-9. After Hernandez's ball cleared the wall, Colorado right field Jake Cave immediately took a few steps toward Barksdale and began yelling. Rockies' second baseman Alan Trejo stepped between Cave and Barksdale after the inning ended.\n\nEvan Phillips got the only batter he faced, Hunter Goodman, to recorded his 11th save in as many chances. Cave, the on-deck hitter, was restrained by bench Mike Redmond as he attempted to reach Bardsdale.\n\nElehuris Montero and Brenton Doyle homered for the Rockies, who scored four runs in the first and twice led by five runs.\n\nDoyle added three singles for his first career four-hit game, scored twice, and made a diving catch of Ohtani's line drive to right-center field with runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh inning, preserving an 8-4 lead.\n\nDodgers starter Walker Buehler gave up eight hits and seven runs in four innings. It was the first time the 29-yeaer-old right-hander allowed more than three earned runs since returning to the rotation May 6 after missing the 2023 season because of Tommy John surgery. He struck out two and walked one.\n\nMichael Petersen (1-0) worked two innings of relief and struck out two for the win.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (shoulder surgery) is scheduled to pitch three innings for Class A Rancho Cucamonga on Wednesday in his first rehab start of the season. \"He's doing fantastic,\" manager Dave Roberts said, adding that Kershaw will follow the natural progression of two or three more rehab starts \"and then we'll see where we are at.\"\n\nRockies: DH/OF Charlie Blackmon (right hamstring tightness) was removed after suffering his injury while running the bases in the first. ... LHP Kyle Freeland (elbow strain) gave up two hits and two runs and struck out four in four innings of a rehab start for Triple-A Albuquerque on Tuesday and appears close to returning. ... 2B Brendan Rodgers (hamstring) did normal pregame work Tuesday and is expected to begin a rehab assignment on Thursday with an eye toward a weekend activation. ...

Teo, he keeps coming up with big hits. That inning, certainly, the results showed the fight, the compete.\"\n\nAccording to Elias Sports Bureau research, the Dodgers had lost 1,137 straight games when trailing by five or more runs in the ninth inning or later, dating back to 1957, their last year in Brooklyn. It was the second-longest active losing streak in that scenario. Only the Mariners (1,234 losses and 0 wins in franchise history) had a longer such losing streak.\n\nWith their comeback win Tuesday, the Dodgers are now 6-2,619 all-time when trailing by five or more runs in the ninth inning or later. Their seven runs were also their most scored in a ninth inning since 2004 against the San Francisco Giants (also seven).\n\nHeyward's fourth career grand slam came off Tyler Kinley and followed walks by Andy Pages and Miguel Vargas around a single by Miguel Rojas. Heyward's fourth homer of the season hit the right field foul pole and pulled the Dodgers within 9-8 with one out in the inning after they trailed 7-2 after four.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if it was going to stay fair or not,\" said Heyward, who hit an inside slider, \"It's Colorado, so maybe that helped it straighten out a little bit. I was like, 'Come on, squeak in, squeak in.' I honestly feel like we got rewarded for our process\" in the ninth.\n\nShohei Ohtani, who had a 476-foot homer in the fifth, singled off Victor Vodnik (1-1) before Will Smith struck out looking after attempting to step out of the batter's box on a 3-2 pitch.\n\nAfter a wild pitch, Freddie Freeman received an intentional walk, his sixth walk in the last two games, bringing up Hernandez. Hernandez took a half-swing at a 1-2 fastball and first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that Hernandez did not commit. Colorado manager Bud Black argued the call and was ejected.\n\nOn the next pitch, Hernandez hit his 18th home run to make it 11-9. It was the first time the Dodgers had hit a grand slam and a three-run homer in the ninth inning in their 140-year history.\n\nAfter Hernandez's ball cleared the wall, Colorado right fielder Jake Cave immediately took a few steps toward Barksdale and began yelling. Rockies second baseman Alan Trejo stepped between Cave and Barksdale after the inning ended.\n\n\"It was close,\" Hernandez said. \"You can call it either way and it will be fine. When Jason hit the grand slam and turning the lineup over to Ohtani, you know something was going to happen. I just wanted to get a good pitch hit to tie the game. I put a little extra and it went over the fence. I knew as soon as I hit. It was great, especially because it put the team ahead.\"\n\nEvan Phillips got the only batter he faced, Hunter Goodman, with a runner on second to record his 11th save in as many chances. Cave, the on-deck hitter, was restrained by bench Mike Redmond as he attempted to reach Barksdale after the game ended.\n\n\"When I'm running in (before the last of the ninth), he looks me right in the face and goes, 'Cave, it's not even close,'\" Cave said. \"Everybody in the world could see it was at least close. And he did swing. It's a big game, it's one of the best teams in baseball and we're battling with them.\n\n\"That game's won on that swing, That's a swing-and-miss, the game's won, and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.\"\n\nElehuris Montero and Brenton Doyle homered for the Rockies, who scored four runs in the first and twice led by five runs.\n\nDoyle added three singles for his first career four-hit game, scored twice, and made a diving catch of Ohtani's line drive to right-center field with runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh inning, preserving an 8-4 lead.\n\nDodgers starter Walker Buehler gave up eight hits and seven runs in four innings. It was the first time the 29-yeaer-old right-hander allowed more than three earned runs since returning to the rotation May 6 after missing the 2023 season because of Tommy John surgery. He struck out two and walked one.\n\nPages also homered for the Dodgers, who have won four of five and are 73-32 against Colorado since 2018. The Rockies have lost five of six.\n\nMichael Petersen (1-0) worked two innings of relief and struck out two in his major league debut.\n\n\"It was crazy,\" said Petersen, whose relatives were in attendance. \"You can't feel anything. It's like your first date, you are tripping over stuff. But awesome.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

Freeman walked in his first four plate appearances before drawing an intentional pass in the eighth inning, tying a franchise record for walks in one game. Max Muncy was the last Dodger player to do it, drawing five walks on April 25, 2021. Freeman added a ninth-inning single. Jason Heyward and Miguel Rojas also had three hits and James Paxton tossed seven strong innings for Los Angeles. Paxton (7-1) allowed one run on two hits and a walk while striking out a season-high eight in his longest outing of the season. Greg Jones homered with two outs in the ninth for his first career hit and Jacob Stallings and Hunter Goodman also went deep for the Rockies. The Dodgers scored in the first inning when Freeman drew a two-out walk and came home on Teoscar Hernandez's double to right. Los Angeles added on in the second. Rojas led off with a single and eventually scored on Ohtani's two-out base hit, and Will Smith tripled to the right field corner to give Los Angeles a 3-0 lead. Ohtani batted leadoff in the Dodgers' first game after Mookie Betts sustained a fractured left hand on Sunday. Betts is expected to return at some point this season. Stallings led off the bottom of the second with his fourth home run of the season to put Colorado on the board. Rockies starter Cal Quantrill (6-5) settled down after the second to pitch five innings. He allowed three runs on seven hits with three walks and three strikeouts to keep his team in the game, but the Dodgers extended their lead against reliever Geoff Hartlieb in the seventh. Heyward singled and scored on a double by Rojas, and Cavan Biggio drove in Rojas with a single up the middle to make it 5-1. Hartlieb avoided more damage when Gavin Lux grounded into a double play to end the inning. Heyward knocked in a pair of runs with a bases-loaded single in the eighth. Biggio scored on Lux's double in the ninth before Lux came in on Smith's sacrifice fly to round out the Dodgers' scoring. Colorado scored four times with two outs in the ninth, capped by Goodman's two-run blast, his fifth of the season. --Field Level Media\n\nFeatured Local Savings", "source": {"uri": "southernminn.com",

Anyone who left the game early with the Rockies taking a five-run lead into the ninth inning probably spent some time sitting in their cars swearing. Dodgers fans would have been upset they missed an incredible comeback while Rockies fans would have just been upset.\n\nThe Dodgers began their comeback with a Jason Heyward grand slam to make it a one-run game with one out. Following a pitching change Shohei Ohtani singled, Will Smith struck out for the second out of the inning and Freddie Freeman was intentionally walked so Victor Vodnik could face Teoscar Hernandez.\n\nOn a 1-2 pitch Vodnik threw Hernandez a high fastball that he really wanted to swing at. In fact, he started to swing before stopping himself. First base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that he did not go around, saving Hernandez from striking out. The Rockies really hated the call and their worst fears were immediately confirmed. Instead of the game being over Hernandez got one more pitch and hit a go-ahead three-run home run.\n\nIf you'd like to see an emotional avatar of Rockies fans after that home run, look no further than right fielder Jake Cave who was visibly furious. He discussed his freakout in the locker room after the game.\n\n\"That game's won on that swing,\" Cave said. \"That's a swing and a miss and the game's won and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers. So yeah I'm pissed. I kind of lost my mind on him a little bit. Got a little more mad when he looked at me and told me it wasn't even close because then you're not even taking any accountability for you know, basically, you know screwing us over. So yeah I was pretty pissed. Still pretty pissed. I think everybody is.\"\n\nIt's an almost unbelievable way to lose, but when you combine the Dodgers lineup and that Colorado air it starts to make sense. Throw in some help from the umpires and the unbelievable seems inevitable.\n\nOr maybe there's a higher power stepping in after the Dodgers lost Mookie Betts for a prolonged period of time. We know Grimace is tied up with the New York Mets, but it could be any other fast food deity watching over the Dodgers in these trying times.

The Rockies added onto their lead with a run in the fourth inning, and the teams traded scores in the sixth and seventh.\n\nUp to that point the Dodgers had received home runs from Andy Pages and Shohei Ohtani, and Miguel Vargas contributed with an RBI double.\n\nThe improbable comeback in the ninth inning began with Pages' leadoff walk that was followed by a base hit from Miguel Rojas.

Replay appeared to show Hern\u00e1ndez did go around and should have been called out to end the game.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez capitalized on the at-bat extending by driving a 101 mph fastball out to right field for what held as a game-winning, three-run home run. Jake Cave immediately turned toward in the field and began shouting in the direction of Barksdale after he watched the ball sail over his head.\n\nTuesday's game represented the biggest ninth-inning comeback in Dodgers franchise history since 1957 and their first time overcoming a five-run deficit in the final frame without going to extras since 1929.", "source": {"uri": "s22927.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_moreno@s22927.pcdn.co", "name": "Matthew Moreno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Rojas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miguel Rojas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intentional base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Barksdale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance Barksdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Black", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bud Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dodgerblue-com.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jason-Heyward-3.jpeg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Paxton (7-1) allowed one run on two hits and struck out a season-high eight in his longest outing of the season.\n\nGreg Jones homered with two outs in the ninth for his first career hit and Jacob Stallings and Hunter Goodman also went deep for the Rockies.\n\nThe Dodgers scored in the first inning when Freeman walked and scored on Teoscar Hernandez's double to right, and then added on in the second.\n\nRojas led off with a single and eventually scored on Ohtani's base hit, and Will Smith tripled to the right field corner to give Los Angeles a 3-0 lead.\n\nOhtani batted leadoff in the Dodgers' first game after Mookie Betts suffered a fractured hand on Sunday. Betts is expected to return at some point this season.\n\nStallings led off the bottom of the second with his fourth home run of the season to put Colorado on the board.\n\nRockies starter Cal Quantrill (6-5) settled down after the second to pitch five innings. He allowed three runs on seven hits to keep his team in the game, but the Dodgers extended their lead against reliever Geoff Hartlieb in the seventh.\n\nHeyward singled and scored on a double by Rojas and Cavan Biggio drove in Rojas with a single up the middle to make it 5-1. Hartlieb avoided more damage when Gavin Lux grounded into a double play to end the inning.\n\nHeyward knocked in a pair of runs with a bases-loaded single in the eighth. Biggio scored on Lux's double in the ninth before Lux scored on a sacrifice fly to round out the Dodgers' scoring.\n\nColorado scored four times with two outs in the ninth, capped by Goodman's two-run blast, his fifth of the season.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sanluisobispo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@sanluisobispo.com",

Heyward's fourth homer of the season pulled the Dodgers within 9-8 with one out in the inning after trailing 7-2 after four innings.\n\nShohei Ohtani, who had a 476-foot homer in the fifth, singled off Victor Vodnik (1-1) before Will Smith struck out looking after attempting to step out of the batter\u00b4s box on a 3-2 pitch.\n\nAfter a wild pitch, Freddie Freeman received an intentional walk, his sixth walk in the last two games, bringing up Hernandez. Hernandez took a half-swing at a 1-2 fastball, but first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that Hernandez did not commit. Colorado manager Bud Black argued the call and was ejected.\n\nOn the next pitch, Hernandez hit his 18th home to make it 11-9. After Hernandez\u00b4s ball cleared the wall, Colorado right field Jake Cave immediately took a few steps toward Barksdale and began yelling. Rockies\u00b4 second baseman Alan Trejo stepped between Cave and Barksdale after the inning ended.\n\nEvan Phillips got the only batter he faced, Hunter Goodman, to recorded his 11th save in as many chances.

It was the first time the 29-yeaer-old right-hander allowed more than three earned runs since returning to the rotation May 6 after missing the 2023 season because of Tommy John surgery.

With the Dodgers listed as a road favorite and the total sitting at 10.5 runs, what's the smart bet tonight from Denver?\n\nAs of this writing, our MLB Public Betting Page shows that 91% of bets are on the Dodgers' moneyline. That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers DFS SPIN\n\nThe Dodgers improved to 46-29 for the year after last night's victory. Los Angeles scored 7 runs in the top of the ninth inning to erase a 5-run victory. Jason Heyward and Teoscar Hernandez both went deep in the 9 inning to secure the victory.\n\nColorado Rockies DFS SPIN\n\nColorado lost their third consecutive game on Tuesday after losing to Los Angeles by a score of 11-9. Brenton Doyle had a big game despite the loss, recording four hits including a home run. The Rockies looks to snap this losing streak on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Dodgers are 7-3 SU in their last 10 games against Colorado.\n\nThe total has gone over in 3 of the last 5 home games for the Rockies.\n\nDodgers vs. Rockies MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake the Dodgers on the run line.

Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports / Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Dodgers' 7-6 loss to the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday marked a reversal of fortunes from Tuesday, when the Rockies allowed the Dodgers to rally for seven runs in the ninth inning. This time it was the Dodgers' turn to lose on a ninth-inning rally, and the decision to remove Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez for Chris Taylor loomed large.\n\nThursday, Gavin Stone takes the ball for the Dodgers in the series finale. Here's what you need to know about the game:\n\nThe Dodgers are favored for a reason. The Dodgers' offense showed promise even in their loss Wednesday. Stone has been consistent, with a 7-2 record and 2.53 ERA. Rockies starter Ty Blach has struggled, posting a 3-4 record with a 4.65 ERA. Stone has allowed five earned runs over his last 17.2 innings and holds a 2-0 record in that time. Meanwhile, Blach has given up 10 earned runs over his last 15.2 innings.

Dating back to when L.A. beat Colorado in 2018's Game 163 to win the divisional title, Monday's victory improved the Dodgers to 40 games over .500 (72-32) against the outmatched Rockies.\n\nL.A. struck first in the opening inning, using Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez's RBI double to score Freddie Freeman. That run was a bad omen for the Rockies, considering the Dodgers entered the evening with an MLB-best 89.2 winning percentage when scoring first.\n\nThe Dodgers improved to 34-4 on the season in that regard despite Cal Quantrill, the Rockies' best pitcher this year, keeping the home team in it for the first half of the game.\n\nWhile Quantrill threw five innings of three-run ball against one of baseball's top offenses, the Colorado bats fell flat until the very end.\n\nThe Rockies only mustered two hits through the first eight innings: Jacob Stallings' solo homer off James Paxton in the second, and Nolan Jones' single off Paxton in the sixth.\n\nAfter taking an early 1-0 lead, L.A. tacked on two runs in the second. Shohei Ohtani roped an RBI single to right and Will Smith followed with an RBI triple, also to right that hit off the foul line.\n\nL.A. then broke the game open against Geoff Hartlieb in the seventh and eighth to make it 7-1. The Dodgers plated two runs off the right-hander in the seventh and two more in the eighth in a frame sparked by Ohtani's leadoff walk and then steal of second.\n\nJustin Lawrence gave up two runs in the ninth via Gavin Lux's RBI double and Smith's sacrifice fly to pad the Dodgers' lead. The side-armer, reinstated from the IL before the game, threw 42 pitches across the eighth and ninth.\n\nOhtani finished 3 for 5 with a walk, an RBI and two runs scored. Each knock by the Japanese sensation was met with a roar from the blue-clad crowd, and when his steal upheld a Colorado challenge, the L.A. fans on hand went crazy.\n\nAs Ohtani lived up to the hype, fellow Dodgers slugger Freddie Freeman walked his way into history. The first baseman drew five walks, one of them intentional, for just the second five-walk game ever at Coors Field. Freeman joined Cooperstown-bound Todd Helton, who walked five times against the Braves on April 29, 2007. Like Helton, Freeman also had a single.\n\nIn garbage time with two outs in the ninth, the Rockies staged a rally that was way too little, too late. Greg Jones roped his first career hit and homer to right field off JP Feyereisen. Michael Toglia and Elehuris Montero followed with consecutive doubles, then Hunter Goodman's two-run blast made it 9-5 before Alan Trejo K'd to end the game.\n\nRoster moves. Ahead of Monday's series opener, Colorado made a handful of roster moves. The Rockies reinstated right-handers Jake Bird and Justin Lawrence from the 15-day injured list, bolstering the bullpen, while placing southpaw reliever Josh Rogers on the 15-day IL with a left rotator cuff strain.\n\nManager Bud Black said Rogers underwent an MRI on Monday to determine the severity of the injury. In a corresponding move, right-hander Angel Chivilli was optioned back to Double-A Hartford.\n\nBlack hopes the return of Bird and Lawrence will help even out Colorado's \"uneven\" bullpen, which carried an MLB-worst 5.70 ERA into Monday's game.\n\nInjury updates. Second baseman Brendan Rodgers, who strained his hamstring running out of the box on June 8 in St. Louis, is nearing a return. He's been doing full baseball activities the last few days, including baserunning and hitting on Monday. He hopes to be back for the Nationals series this weekend, but it could be longer.\n\n\"It was pretty minor and when I initially did it, I knew it was going to be in the range of 10-15 days, and I'm right in that time frame and feeling a lot better,\" Rodgers said.\n\nWhen Rodgers gets back to the lineup, rookie Adael Amador, the club's top prospect, will likely be sent back to Double-A Hartford.\n\nRight-hander German Marquez continues his trajectory back to the big-league lineup from Tommy John surgery. He threw two-plus innings on Sunday with Low-A Fresno, allowing four runs on six hits. Black said \"he pitched better than the line indicated, the most important thing is after after the game he felt wonderful, and had no problems with the arm.\"\n\nMarquez now heads to High-A Spokane for another rehab start later this week. The goal remains to have him back in LoDo around the all-star break.\n\nOutfielder Sean Bouchard (ankle sprain) and left-hander Kyle Freeland (elbow strain) are both playing for Triple-A Albuquerque on Tuesday in Oklahoma City.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_newman@denverpost.com", "name": "Kyle Newman", "type":

He and Elehuris Montero singled to set the table for Adael Amador, who grounded into a force out at second\n\nThe game-winning run, which Cave scored directly in front of home plate umpire Lance Barksdale, tasted especially sweet. Cave was the Rockies' most furious player after Barksdale's missed call from first base on a check swing cost Colorado the final out of Tuesday's game.\n\nThe Rockies are 5-14 against the Dodgers since the start of the 2023 season. They will attempt to earn a four-game split Thursday in a matinee at Coors Field.\n\nThey earned another head start against their seemingly insurmountable division rival when Michael Toglia took Bobby Miller deep for a 3-0 first-inning lead. Toglia was on cycle watch after tripling his next at-bat, but that fizzled out by the end of a 2-for-4 night.\n\nThe Dodgers didn't need all nine innings to conjure a comeback this time. They only needed one opportunity. Shohei Ohtani, attracting an enthusiastic reception before every plate appearance, cleared the bases with a two-out double into the left-center alley. He scored on a Freddie Freeman single, and it was 4-3 Los Angeles by the bottom of the second.\n\nMiller shook off the early home run and settled in for the Dodgers in his first appearance since April 10, carrying a 6-4 lead into the seventh after Jason Heyward's go-ahead two-run double. But Dave Roberts might have left his starter on the mound a little too long. Miller gave up a leadoff double to Sean Bouchard then got the first out before exiting to a small ovation from Dodgers fans.\n\nDaniel Hudson's first pitch was grounded to third by Montero and bobbled by Cavan Biggio, a run-scoring error that breathed new life into Coors Field. The tying runner was on, and eventually around the bases after an Amador double and the first of Doyle's clutch productive outs. The final line for Miller included five earned runs.\n\nRockies pitcher Ryan Feltner gave up all of the Dodgers' six runs in a five-inning start, striking out six and walking two.\n\nCharlie Blackmon did not play in Wednesday's game due to right hamstring tightness, an injury Rockies manager Bud Black described as day-to-day moving forward. Black didn't rule out a Blackmon appearance when he spoke to reporters pregame, but he said the veteran designated hitter would \"probably not\" be available.\n\nBlackmon was removed from the game Tuesday after injuring his hamstring while running the bases. He was hit by a pitch in the first inning and advanced gingerly to third base after pulling up as he rounded second.\n\nRockies left fielder Nolan Jones was also scratched from the lineup before the first pitch due to illness. Batting sixth in his place, Bouchard went 1 for 3 with a run and an RBI.\n\nRockies LHP Ty Blach (3-4, 4.65 ERA) vs. Dodgers RHP Gavin Stone (7-2, 3.01 ERA)\n\n1:10 p.m. Thursday, Coors Field\n\nTV: Rockies.TV (streaming); Comcast/Xfinity (channel 1262); DirecTV (683); Spectrum (130, 445, 305, 435 or 445, depending on region).\n\nRadio: 850 AM/94.1 FM\n\nBlach is scheduled to make his ninth start of the season and 12th overall appearance, coming off a winning decision in his last start. He is 3-2 with a 3.76 ERA in eight outings at Coors Field in 2024. His numbers have also been impressive against the Dodgers: a 3.13 career ERA in 77.2 innings pitched. Blach has faced exactly 25 batters in each of his last three starts, allowing seven or more hits including a home run and not making it through the sixth inning. He has a 5.74 ERA during that stretch, but he struck out 10 and walked only two across those starts. This will be Blach's first time facing the Dodgers this season.\n\nStone is fresh off a seven-inning no-decision on June 14 against the Royals. He pitched against the Rockies on June 2, tossing five scoreless while striking out six in a win for Los Angeles. The 25-year-old has a 5.11 career ERA on the road in 44 innings. He boasts a 1.82 ERA in his last four appearances, including an impressive start into the sixth inning against the AL-best Yankees.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers overcame a 9-4 deficit by scoring seven runs in the top of the ninth inning Tuesday night to beat the Colorado Rockies.\n\nThe 11-9 victory was one of the most dramatic comebacks in team history, according to Sarah Langs of MLB.com:\n\nthis was the 6th win in Dodgers franchise history when trailing by 5+ runs in the 9th inning or later:\n\nToday at COL\n\n7/18/57 vs STL\n\n7/12/29 vs STL\n\n6/25/29 at NYG\n\n5/6/1898 vs Washington Senators\n\n4/29/1893 at PHI\n\nh/t @EliasSports\n\nThe big blast in the comeback was a three-run homer by Teoscar Hernandez, which turned a 9-8 deficit into the 11-9 lead for Los Angeles. However, the blast didn't come without some controversy.\n\nPer Rowan Kavner of FOX Sports:\n\nAbsolutely bonkers minute of action at Coors.\n\nThe Rockies thought they won on a strikeout, Lance Barksdale says Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez checked his swing, Bud Black gets run, Teo hits a go-ahead ding dong on the next pitch, Jake Cave displeased.\n\nFor what it's worth, it certainly looks like Hernandez went...\n\nAfter the win, the Dodgers are now 46-29 and continue to lead the National League West. The Rockies are 25-48 and continue to be a bottom-three team in all of baseball.\n\nAfter the homer, Hernandez is hitting .255 with 18 homers and 54 RBI. It's been a nice comeback year for him after hitting \"just\" 26 homers for Seattle a season ago. With Mookie Betts out, the Dodgers undoubtedly need big contributions from the rest of the lineup and Hernandez is doing just that.\n\nThe Dodgers and Rockies will play again Wednesday with first pitch at 8:40 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cave", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Barksdale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance Barksdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Black", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bud Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hernandez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Hernandez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4918,h_2766,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01j0r7c0jm3vmqwccqc2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 180, "textEnd": 187}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The game was three outs away from being over.\n\nOf course, that's when they finally came alive.\n\nThe Dodgers, behind two massive home runs from Jayson Heyward and Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, pulled off an improbable rally to claim an 11-9 win over the Colorado Rockies. They put up seven runs in the ninth inning alone.\n\nFirst, after loading up the bases, it was Heyward who drilled a grand slam with his deep shot off the right field foul pole. That suddenly made it a one-run game.\n\nThen, with two outs and two strikes on him, Hern\u00e1ndez followed suit. He hit a three-run home run himself to put the Dodgers in the lead for the first time all night.\n\nFrom there, the Dodgers quickly shut down the Rockies in the bottom of the inning to grab the win.\n\nThe Dodgers entered the ninth inning with four runs on the board, thanks largely to star Shohei Ohtani. He had two hits, two RBI and a massive solo home run in the sixth inning -- which traveled a season-record 476 feet into center field off of Rockies pitcher Austin Gomber.\n\nOhtani now has 20 home runs and 91 hits and 49 RBI on the year.\n\nThe win marked the Dodgers' fourth in their last five games and second straight over the Rockies. They hold a 46-29 record, which is good for a massive lead in the NL West, heading into Wednesday's game in Denver -- which will be the third in the four-game series against the Rockies.\n\nThe Rockies, on the other hand, sit in last in the division standings and have now lost seven of their last nine games.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Gomber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Gomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ASC8ZAVt7AtgjUO6YRfecg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/b6d339d0-2ded-11ef-8fd6-1db695632de7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Jason Heyward pinch-hit for Chris Taylor, and promptly hit a grand slam to get the Dodgers closer than they'd been since the top of the first inning.\n\nThen things got very weird.\n\nShohei Ohtani singled off Victor Vodnik, putting the tying run on base. Will Smith on a 3-2 pitch tried to verbally call time then inexplicably stepped out of the box as a third strike crossed the plate. Home plate umpire Will Little did not grant time, making Smith the second out.\n\nThen came Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, who fell behind 1-2, then tried to check his swing on an outside pitch. First base umpire Lance Barksdale agreed that Hern\u00e1ndez did in fact check his swing, which angered just about everyone on the Rockies, from Jake Cave in right field to Vodnik on the mound. Manager Bud Black got ejected and might have set a record for most times saying \"That's fucking bullshit\" in one sitting.\n\nHad that been ruled a swing, the game would be over, a tough Dodgers loss. But granted new life, Hern\u00e1ndez mauled the next pitch he saw for a game-winning three-run shot to right field.\n\nThis was shades of August 31, 2016, when the Dodgers trailed by five in the eighth inning at Coors Field. They scored three in the eighth and five in the ninth, the latter punctuated by an Andrew Toles grand slam.\n\nBut Tuesday night was even wilder.\n\nThat the Dodgers were even in this position was unbelievable, as they trailed by four runs after one inning and five runs after two. Walker Buehler had his worst start since returning from the injured list. More on that later.\n\nThe Dodgers chipped away at the deficit, but after batting in the top of the first inning they never pulled closer than to within three runs until the ninth. The Rockies answered three of the Dodgers' four one-run innings by scoring immediately in the bottom of the frame, and in the other instance Colorado waited only one inning to get back that run.\n\nPages and Ohtani each hit home runs. Ohtani's homer was his fifth in the last eight games and 20th of the season.\n\nAt 476 feet, it's the longest MLB home run of the season, and the second-longest homer hit by a Dodger dating back to 2015, when Statcast started tracking such things. The only longer Dodgers home run during that time was by then-rookie Joc Pederson, who hit a 477-foot homer on June 2, 2015, also at Coors Field.\n\nDown four with two outs and two runners on in the seventh, Ohtani hit the snot out of the ball again, but his 111.7-mph, would-be two-run extra-base hit instead died in the glove a diving Doyle in center field, one of the best catches you'll see this season.\n\nMichael Petersen made his major league debut in the seventh inning, two days after he was called up from Triple-A by the Dodgers. The 30-year-old right-hander walked his first batter, Nolan Jones, who advanced to third on a single and scored on a sacrifice fly. Petersen settled down in a perfect eighth inning, striking out both Montero and Doyle, each of whom homered earlier, for his first two major league strikeouts.\n\nPetersen is the first Dodger born in the United Kingdom. He's the 28th different pitcher used by the Dodgers this season, tied with the Brewers for second-most in the majors this season, one behind the Marlins.\n\nThanks to the improbable comeback, Petersen for his efforts not only made his debut, but picked up his first major league win. He's just the 14th Dodgers pitcher since 1901 to earn the win in relief in his MLB debut, and the first since Dennis Santana in 2018, also at Coors Field.\n\nHome runs: Andy Pages (8), Shohei Ohtani (20), Jason Heyward (4), Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez (18); Elehuris Montero (4), Brenton Doyle (6)\n\nBobby Miller will be activated from the injured list to make his first start for the Dodgers in 10 weeks on Wednesday (5:40 p.m. PT, SportsNet LA).

When he crossed home on Brenton Doyle's walk-off sacrifice fly win over the Dodgers, he greeted umpire Lance Barksdale whose ears were likely still ringing from the screams Cave dealt him Tuesday.\n\nColorado followed up its heartbreaking loss with a 7-6 tally Wednesday to set up a possible series split with the Dodgers if it can come through again Thursday.\n\nRockies manager Bud Black said before the game that the previous day's results weren't their concern. He said good or bad, he and his team need to wipe the results.\n\nOn Tuesday, Colorado was dealt a tough blow when Barksdale called a checked swing a ball and left Victor Vodnik without a third out. Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez hit a three-run, go-ahead homer soon after that doomed the club to another loss to its division rival.\n\nIt was the sixth time this season that the Rockies entered the ninth inning with a lead and allowed five or more runs to lose it. No team in the Modern Era has done more in a season, and the year has months to go.\n\nBlack wanted to see his team respond to the adversity by learning from it but forgetting it. When the Rockies jumped out to a 3-0 lead Wednesday, it looked like they had done just that.\n\nShohei Ohtani's three-run double in the second inning was a swift reminder of how a game can change within minutes, just as Tuesday's loss did.\n\nThe Dodgers dealt another blow in the fifth when they went up 6-4 and looked primed for a possible sweep. A term that circles around the Rockies clubhouse is \"push back.\"\n\nCave's single, Elehuris Montero's single and Doyle's eventual sacrifice fly in the ninth inning were their push.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\n\"Baseball is kind of poetic sometimes,\" Cave said. \"I think it shows that records can show some things, but you when you watch us go out there against a really good team and string good at-bats together... it's the sign of a really good team.\"\n\nAdael Amador's effort came after a foul bunt attempt. A quick mound meeting allowed Black to call it off and let him swing -- the No. 1 prospect grounded out to the right side to advance Cave to third before Doyle drove him in.\n\nAs much as the Rockies want to wipe previous results, replicating winning ones would be a welcome change.\n\nThey haven't won back-to-back games since May 29 and 31 against Cleveland and the Dodgers. In the team's first 74 games, it's only won multiple games in a row three times -- one of the stretches came during Colorado's seven-game win streak. The other two streaks only lasted two games.\n\nThe Rockies have a chance to change that on Thursday.\n\nRockies 7, Dodgers 6\n\nWhat happened: Colorado battled back and forth with Los Angeles until Brenton Doyle's walk-off sacrifice fly scored Jake Cave and completed the Rockies' comeback from a 6-4 deficit.\n\nOn the mound: Ryan Feltner dealt with trouble but worked five innings. He allowed six earned runs -- four in the second inning -- on seven hits and two walks. He also struck out six. Nick Mears, Jake Bird and Jalen Beeks combined for four scoreless innings and five strikeouts in the bullpen's rebound effort.\n\nAt the plate: Doyle's walk-off sacrifice fly was the first of his career. He drove in two runs, both on sacrifice flies. Michael Toglia hit his sixth home run in the first inning to give the Rockies a quick lead. Sean Bouchard, Adael Amador and Jacob Stallings added doubles to the Rockies' 10 hits. They struck out four times to three walks.\n\nWhat's next: Los Angeles Dodgers (RHP Gavin Stone, 7-2) at Colorado Rockies (LHP Ty Blach, 3-4) at 1:10 p.m. on Thursday at Coors Field.", "source":

A handful of good at-bats, some well-placed singles, pinch-hit grand slam from Jason Heyward, and a go-ahead three-run homer by Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez capped off a seven-run rally.\n\nFollowing a controversial no-call on a check swing, Hern\u00e1ndez deposited the next pitch over the right field wall, giving the Dodgers an 11-9 lead. It was the first time in 66 years that the Dodgers completed a comeback of that magnitude in the ninth inning and first since 1957.\n\nPrior to Tuesday, the most recent instance in franchise history was 1957 Brooklyn Dodgers scoring five runs in the bottom of the ninth to tie the game before winning in extra innings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Dodgers' resilient effort made for one of the best comebacks in franchise history and a staple game thus far in the regular season.\n\nIn their 16 games in June, the Dodgers' offense ranks third in Major League Baseball with a combined 139 wRC+.\n\nTheir .838 on-base plus percentage slugging ranks fourth, and their .217 ISO is second behind the Baltimore Orioles.

Even before the game, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts counseled patience for Buehler.\n\n\"The competitor in him wants and expects him to go out there and pitch as an ace tonight, right now, but I think it's a coach's job to kind of temper expectations at certain times,\" Roberts said before Tuesday's game.\n\nHis words of caution played out in the heat of the game as Buehler was hit hard early by the Rockies, but Buehler's teammates roared back to take him off the hook.\n\nTyler Kinley issued two walks around a single to Miguel Rojas as the Dodgers loaded the bases with one out in the ninth, bringing up Heyward, who was batting for Chris Taylor. Heyward came through with his fourth career grand slam, hitting the foul pole down the right field line to bring the Dodgers to within 9-8.\n\nVictor Vodnik relieved Kinley and Shohei Ohtani singled to keep the rally alive. Vodnik fanned Will Smith for the second out and Freddie Freeman was walked intentionally, bringing up Hernandez. With two strikes, Hernandez checked his swing on a pitch. Rockies catcher Hunter Goodman appealed the call but first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled he didn't go around. Rockies manager Bud Black argued the ruling and was ejected.\n\nHernandez drilled the next pitch he saw from Vodnik (1-1) for his 18th homer of the season, a three-run shot into right center field that put the Dodgers over the top.\n\nMichael Petersen (1-0) allowed one run in two innings to pick up the win and Alex Vesia notched his 11th save.\n\nOhtani and Andy Pages homered earlier for the Dodgers. Ohtani's homer off Austin Gomber leading off the sixth was his 20th of the season and landed in the stand of evergreens beyond the centerfield fence, traveling 476 feet, the longest home run in the majors this season.\n\nBuehler hit the first batter he faced, Charlie Blackmon, with a pitch and the next three batters he faced all connected for hits. He trailed 4-0 after the first inning and wound up going four innings, allowing seven runs on seven hits, including home runs by Elehuris Montero and Brenton Doyle. He struck out two and walked one.\n\nHis ERA stands at 5.84 eight starts into a comeback campaign that includes his first win in nearly two years but also a series of ragged outings that demonstrate the rocky road he faces in recapturing his dominating mound presence, epitomized by his 16-win season in 2021.\n\nThe Rockies Doyle played a big role in quashing a potential game-turning rally in the seventh. With two outs and two on, Ohtani hit a sinking liner that center fielder Doyle sprinted after, leaping at the last moment to catch the ball in mid-air before crashing to the ground. The play robbed Ohtani of extra bases and deprived the Dodgers of two runs.", "source": {"uri": "dailybreeze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Breeze"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Dodgers will try to extend that trend when they face the Rockies in the second contest of a four-game series on Tuesday.\n\nThe Dodgers will send right-hander Walker Buehler (1-4, 4.64 ERA) to face Rockies left-hander Austin Gomber (1-4, 4.26).\n\nBuehler, who will oppose Colorado for the second time this season, was saddled with the Dodgers' lone loss during a three-game home series vs. the Rockies in late May. He yielded four runs (three earned) in six innings.\n\nBuehler is still working his way back from Tommy John surgery that cost him part of the 2022 season and all of 2023.\n\nIn three of his past four starts, he tossed at least 88 pitches. However, working at altitude could keep him from going deep into the Tuesday game. Buehler has opposed Colorado 21 times, including 17 starts, going 7-3 with a 4.19 ERA.\n\nThe Dodgers won Tuesday night without Mookie Betts in the lineup -- and it will be awhile before the seven-time All-Star is back. Betts is expected to miss six to eight weeks after sustaining a fractured left hand on Sunday, an injury that created a void at the top of the lineup.\n\nManager Dave Roberts solved that issue Monday night by moving Shohei Ohtani into the leadoff spot and batting Will Smith to second, the spot where Ohtani usually has batted this season.\n\n\"I don't expect Ohtani to change,\" Roberts said. \"I don't expect Will to change. Ohtani has hit leadoff in his career, so I felt comfortable that it's a position he's known before.\"\n\nOhtani went 3-for-5 with a walk, two runs and an RBI in the series opener. Smith went 1-for-5 with an RBI triple and a sacrifice fly.\n\nThe task of holding down the Dodgers' bats falls to Gomber. The lefty hasn't had any success against Los Angeles in his career, going 0-4 with a 6.00 ERA in eight appearances (seven starts). He took a loss at Dodger Stadium on June 2 when he allowed three runs on five hits in three innings.\n\nGomber is coming off one of his worst outings of the season, when he gave up eight runs and a career-high-tying 11 hits in three-plus innings during a 17-9 loss at Minnesota on Wednesday.\n\nIt continued a trend in June for Gomber. He has allowed 15 runs and 22 hits in 11-plus innings (12.27 ERA) over three starts this month after he posted a 0.68 ERA in four May outings.\n\n\"I feel the same (as) I did a month ago,\" Gomber said after the loss to the Twins. \"I'm just not making as good of pitches right now, and some things that were going my way are not going my way right now. That's part of the game.\"\n\nThe Rockies' lineup, meanwhile, remains inconsistent. Colorado managed just two hits in seven innings against Los Angeles starter James Paxton on Monday before erupting for four runs in the ninth, but that was after falling behind by eight.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@reuters.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Gomber", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austin Gomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paxton_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Paxton (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 2048, "textEnd": 2054}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

First pitch is scheduled for 12:10 p.m. PT.\n\nBobby Miller wasn't particularly sharp in his return from the 15-day injured list as he struggled to put hitters away and allowed five runs but still managed to pitch into the seventh inning.\n\nMiller retired his first two batters faced before running into some trouble that resulted in Michael Toglia hitting a three-run home run. Miller then benefitted from inning-ending double plays in the second and third, but a leadoff triple in the fourth led to a run.\n\nThe 25-year-old did improve his efficiency late into the start, needing just eight pitches to get through both the fifth and sixth innings. Miller didn't retire the side in order until the sixth.\n\nA fifth run was charged to Miller after he gave way to Daniel Hudson, who was let down by shaky defense. A double and sacrifice fly allowed the Rockies to tie the game.\n\nMiller had been staked a lead thanks to Heyward's two-run double in the fifth inning that put the Dodgers back ahead. It marked Heyward's second consecutive game with an extra-base hit as he combined with Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez to make MLB history on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier in the game, Ohtani erased the Dodgers' deficit by hitting a two-out double with the bases loaded in the second inning. Freddie Freeman followed that with an RBI single to give the Dodgers a 4-3 lead.\n\nOhtani had another opportunity to deliver for the Dodgers in the eighth inning but was called out on strikes, stranding a go-ahead runner in scoring position.\n\nThe Rockies didn't squander such an opportunity against Yohan Ram\u00edrez in the ninth inning as back-to-back singles set the table for a game-winning sacrifice fly by Brenton Doyle.\n\nPrior to the game, the Dodgers placed Walker Buehler on the 15-day injured list with right hip inflammation as a corresponding move to activating Miller.", "source": {"uri": "dodgerblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_moreno@dodgerblue.com", "name": "Matthew Moreno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Toglia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Toglia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohan_Ram\u00edrez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yohan Ram\u00edrez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s22927.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Michael-Toglia-Ryan-McMahon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

His presence on the Rockies will either last until they can use him to elevate a contender or prove to already-existent ones that he can be a missing piece at the trade deadline.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers have seen him twice and forced him to throw 95 pitches the first time in 4 \u2153 innings and 99 pitches in five innings in Colorado's latest loss.\n\n\"They just fight you the whole way through the lineup,\" Quantrill said. \"I think they fouled off 1,000 pitches today it felt like.\"\n\nInjuries have ravaged the Los Angeles pitching staff, and it could likely use a guy like Quantrill.

Jake Cave and Brendan Rodgers are other offensive pieces that would make sense to move.

He walked at least three hitters for the sixth time in 15 starts. Jake Bird threw a clean inning in his return from the injured list before Geoff Hartlieb allowed four earned runs and allowed the Dodgers to put the game out of reach. He walked three hitters and gave up four hits in 1\u2154 innings. Justin Lawrence also returned from the IL and allowed two earned runs in 1\u2153 innings.\n\nAt the plate: Greg Jones hit his first career home run as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning. It was also his first career hit. Jacob Stallings, who he subbed in for, also homered in the second inning. Michael Toglia doubled in the final frame as part of Colorado's six hits. The Rockies struck out nine times and walked once while the Dodgers had 14 hits and eight walks.\n\nWhat's next: Los Angeles Dodgers (RHP Walker Buehler, 1-4) at Colorado Rockies (LHP Austin Gomber,

The young right-hander, who has been a stable arm for the staff, faces the Colorado Rockies in the last of a four-game series in Denver on Thursday.\n\nStone (7-2, 3.01 ERA) will be opposed by Colorado lefty Ty Blach (3-4, 4.65), who will try to give the Rockies a split of the series.\n\nColorado dropped the first two games but rebounded to win 7-6 on Wednesday night on Brenton Doyle's sacrifice fly in the ninth.\n\nStone, 25, made his major league debut last year and moved into the rotation this season. He failed to get out of the fourth inning twice in his first four starts, has pitched at least six innings in seven of his last nine.\n\nHis workload has helped prevent the Los Angeles bullpen from being overworked.\n\n\"He's been consistent,\" manager Dave Roberts said. \"I think with Gavin, I've got all the trust in the world in him that he can make a pitch when he needs to, get back after a tough inning and keep us in the ballgame, save the bullpen, which it seems he does every time he takes the baseball.\"\n\nStone did that in his last start Friday night, going seven innings and keeping the Dodgers in the game until they could rally to defeat the visiting Kansas City Royals. He got a no-decision in victory, snapping a streak of three straight wins.\n\nOne of those victories was against the Rockies on June 2 when he tossed five shutout innings. It is his only career appearance against Colorado.\n\nBlach has not matched Stone's success this year, but he has proven valuable to the Rockies since joining the rotation on May 12. That has especially been true at Coors Field, where he is 3-2 with a 3.76 ERA in eight appearances, including six starts.\n\nHe has faced Los Angeles 20 times in his career -- including nine starts -- and is 4-3 with one save and a 3.13 ERA.\n\nColorado outfielder Charlie Blackmon will likely be out of the lineup for the second straight game after sustaining a right hamstring injury on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Rockies have not had trouble scoring runs in this series, but they have struggled to keep Los Angeles from putting up big numbers. The Dodgers have scored 26 runs in the first three games, seven of which came in the ninth inning on Tuesday. Teoscar Hernandez's three-run blast capped that frame after a questionable check-swing call.\n\nJake Cave became a fan favorite for his visceral reaction to the home run, yelling at first base umpire Lance Barksdale from right field. He then scored the winning run on Wednesday night.\n\n\"If the fans love that, then I love it,\" Cave said after Wednesday's win. \"I don't think too many Dodgers fans like me, but Colorado fans do, so I'm happy about that.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@reuters.com", "name": "Field Level

Rockies", "body": "The Los Angeles Dodgers had just a 0.5% win probability as they entered the ninth inning, trailing the Colorado Rockies by five runs on Tuesday.\n\nBut don't tell that to the Dodgers as they overcame all odds and rallied their way to an 11-9 victory, thanks to a seven-run ninth inning.\n\nComing back from a five-run deficit in just one inning takes a complete team effort, and a little luck.\n\nThe Dodgers had both going for them, and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts noted his club never gave up and continued to fight until the final out, via Dennis Georgatos of the Southern California News Group:\n\n\"It was quality of at-bat up and down the lineup,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"Jason was ready when called upon. Teo, he keeps coming up with big hits. That inning, certainly, the results showed the fight, the compete.\"\n\nThe inning started with a walk from Andy Pages, and Miguel Rojas followed with a single. Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez struck out, but Miguel Vargas worked a great at-bat to draw a walk, loading the bases.\n\nWith Chris Taylor set to hit against a right-hander, Dave Roberts called on Jason Heyward to pinch-hit, still trailing by five. Heyward took a six-pitch at-bat, and the final result was a grand slam home run down the right field line:\n\n\"I wasn't sure if that was going to stay fair or not,\" Heyward said. \"It's Colorado, so maybe that helped straighten it out a little bit. But given that it was a slider and in the location it was, it definitely was a tough pitch to keep fair. I was like, 'Come on, come on, squeak in, squeak in, and it hit off the pole,' and I said, 'all right, we're good.' I honestly feel like we got rewarded for our process\" in the ninth.\n\nThe Dodgers had life, now trailing by just one run with the top of their lineup coming up. Their win probability was up to 8.7%, still slim odds, but a chance, nonetheless:\n\n\"When Jason hit the grand slam, and turned the lineup up to Ohtani, you knew something was going to happen,\" Hernandez said. \"It was not going to go and end like that.\"\n\nShohei Ohtani singled to left field, increasing the Dodgers' win probability to 16.9%. The odds were still stacked against them, but rising.\n\nThat was until Will Smith struck out looking at a pitch down the middle after the umpire declined to grant him a timeout. That decreased the Dodgers' win probability to just 7.8%.\n\nA wild pitch allowed Ohtani to advance to second base, and at that point, the Dodgers decided to intentionally walk Freddie Freeman, giving them a 14% chance to win.\n\nTeoscar Hern\u00e1ndez was now at the plate and reached a 1-2 count before a controversial check swing was ruled in his favor. The Dodgers caught their lucky break, and Rockies manager Bud Black was ejected from the game for arguing it.\n\nOn the very next pitch, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez swung, this time for real, and blasted a fastball over the right field fence to give the Dodgers an 11-9 lead. An increase of 77.6% to their win probability to take their odds from 0.5% at the start of the inning to 91.6%.\n\nThe ball was crushed, leaving the bat at 106.3 mph and traveling 423 feet as Hern\u00e1ndez admired it out of the batter's box:\n\n\"I knew as soon as I hit it,\" Hernandez said. \"It was great, especially because I put the team ahead.\"\n\nAlex Vesia started the ninth inning and recorded two outs before walking Nolan Jones. Evan Phillips then entered the game and struck out Hunter Goodman on five pitches.\n\nBallgame. An improbable comeback complete.\n\nWhile Hern\u00e1ndez's check swing drew a ton of attention and criticism from the Rockies and on social media, all of that is based on opinion of what a swing is, and not facts based on MLB's official rule book.\n\nMLB's rules are incredibly vague regarding what a swing is. The only definition is what an umpire rules is an attempt to strike the ball, or offer at a pitch.\n\nIt is a common misconception that breaking the plane of the plate or breaking the wrists have anything to do with what constitutes as a swing. Neither of those things are endorsed by the league.\n\nMLB's rule book fully leaves it up to the umpire at that moment to decide what they believe is a swing, and that is something the league should look into fixing.", "source": {"uri": "dodgerblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "blake_williams@dodgerblue.com", "name": "Blake Williams", "type": "author",

The count was one ball and two strikes, and relief pitcher Victor Vodnik threw a high fastball, which resulted in a borderline half swing.\n\n\"He went,\" said Rockies announcer Drew Goodman, as Vodnik was seen walking off the mound. \"Oh, man. Lance Barksdale said no.\"\n\nThe whole crowd and Colorado team thought it was a strikeout, which would have ended the game. However, the first base umpire said he didn't go all the way around, so the count then became 2-2.\n\nAs if it couldn't have been scripted any worse for the Rockies, after the Dodgers were gifted a second life, the very next pitch Hernandez hit a 423-foot home run to right center field. Freddie Freeman and Shohei Ohtani both scored off the 3-RBI homer, so the score was now 11-9, as the Dodgers rallied to score seven runs in the last inning.\n\nThe Rockies play-by-play announcer, was heard frustrated on the broadcast.\n\n\"The 2-2, in the air, deep right-center and this one is gone. You got to be kidding me!\" Goodman said. \"From a strikeout to a three-run homer.\"\n\nManager Bud Black, who was tossed for arguing the call, talked about the umpiring during the postgame interviews.\n\n\"I saw a swing, a checked swing, but I thought he went on it,\" Black stated.\n\nRockies right fielder, Jake Cave, appeared fired up after seeing the home run fly over his head, noting that the game would have been over if the umpire simply made the right call.\n\n\"I mean I was yelling at it from right, obviously during the inning. But then when we made the last out, I'm running in, and he looks me right in the face and goes 'Cave, it's not even close.' So that's when I really got pissed, because 'are you that out of tune with the game?' Where you tell me that's not even close. Everybody in the world can see that it is at least close.\"\n\nCave continued, \"That game is won on that swing, that is a swing and a miss, and the game is won, and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers. So yeah I'm pissed.\"\n\nWith a loss, the Rockies (25-48) now fall 20 games back behind the Dodgers (46-29) in the NL West, who have the second-best record in the National League, as they are only one of three NL teams (Phillies: 49-25, Brewers: 43-30) who currently have a winning record.", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA | NBA |  WWE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_santomauro@fanbuzz.com", "name": "Brandon Santomauro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Goodman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Goodman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Barksdale", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lance Barksdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Black", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bud Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hernandez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Hernandez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Outdoor_Play", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Outdoor Play", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://fanbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/IMG_0985.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The Dodgers moved up one spot, from No. 5 to No. 4 on the list.\n\nThe Dodgers moved past the Cleveland Guardians in the rankings as the Guardians dropped to No. 5. Cleveland lost four of its five games since last week.\n\nThe Dodgers have won their last three games, including a miraculous win on Tuesday night in which they came back against the Colorado Rockies thanks to two late home runs. Jason Heyward hit a grand slam, followed by Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez hitting a three-run home run, that gave the Dodgers an 11-9 win, despite the team trailing 9-4 entering the ninth inning.\n\nOverall, the Dodgers are 4-3 since last week's power rankings, which includes winning two of three games against the Kansas City Royals in Los Angeles.\n\nWith two more games against the Colorado Rockies, two games against the Los Angeles Angels, and a series against the Chicago White Sox approaching, the Dodgers are in a great position to continue racking up wins and potentially rise in the rankings. They do not face another top team until July 9, when they begin a series against the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nOf course, the biggest obstacle for the Dodgers is the team is the rotator cuff injury to starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and the fractured left hand of shortstop Mookie Betts. Both stars went to the injured list this week.\n\nWith both players set to miss time, other players will need to step up to maintain the Dodgers' place in the rankings. They visit the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday holding a nine-game lead over the second-place San Diego Padres in the National League West standings.\n\nPhoto Credit: Isaiah J.

They entered the ninth inning of their contest against the Colorado Rockies down 9-4, and a five-run deficit at any point of the game is difficult to overcome, let alone with the team having only three outs to work with. But the Dodgers showed resilience with a rousing seven-run ninth inning to turn the game on its head en route to an 11-9 victory.\n\nWhile there were many Dodgers heroes that stepped up in the ninth inning, in the end, it was right fielder Teoscar Hernandez who dealt the decisive blow. Perhaps slighted by the fact that the Rockies intentionally walked the hitter in front of him in the order, Freddie Freeman, to get to him with two outs, Hernandez uncorked a three-run bomb that gave the Dodgers a lead that they would not relinquish.\n\nHernandez has been on a tear for the Dodgers since signing with them in free agency this past offseason, and he credited the unwavering fan support for bringing out the best in him as he plays the happiest baseball of his life.\n\n\"Being in here, my first year, the way they support me, through almost half of the season, has been incredible. I love that. I'm happy to be here,\" Hernandez said in his postgame interview with SportsNet LA's Kirsten Watson.\n\nThe Dodgers are as stacked of a team as there is, and on Tuesday, they had utmost belief that they could pull off a miracle comeback -- with contributions coming even from unlikely places. It was Jason Heyward who started off the Dodgers' comeback with a pinch-hit grand slam and Tesocar Hernandez finished off the Rockies with yet another clutch dinger.\n\n\"We know that we're capable. We're gonna fight until the last out. That's what we did tonight. Thank God we got the win,\" Hernandez added. \"I enjoy when my team needs me the most. And I delivered. My emotions are going through the sky.\"\n\nTeoscar Hernandez has been worth every penny\n\nThe Dodgers' signings of Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto stole the show during this past offseason. But Teoscar Hernandez has been very impactful in his own right, outplaying expectations after the Dodgers signed him to a one-year, $23.5 million deal.\n\nHernandez entered Tuesday with an OPS of .826, hitting 17 home runs and driving in 51 runs to that point. He has been worth 1.9 WAR already (per Fangraphs), which already makes him more valuable for the Dodgers through 74 games than he was for the Seattle Mariners for the entirety of his down 2023 campaign. Against the Rockies, Hernandez, yet again, showed that he has nerves of steel, unfazed by the brightest of spotlights.\n\nThe rich only tend to get richer, and the Dodgers simply cannot stop taking wins as a franchise. Now, Mookie Betts may be headed for a six to eight week absence due to a broken hand, but Teoscar Hernandez, among others, has a tendency of delivering for the team when they need him to. So expect the Dodgers not to miss a single beat even amid Betts' injury.\n\nJason Heyward continues his revival\n\nBy the end of the 2022 season, it looked as though Jason Heyward's days in the MLB were coming to an end. After all, he did not play up to expectations at all after he signed a huge contract with the Chicago Cubs. But the Dodgers took a flier on him in 2023, and Heyward proceeded to post the best season of his career since 2015 -- hitting 15 home runs and tallying 40 RBIs in only 377 plate appearances.\n\nThe Dodgers brought Heyward back on a one-year, $9 million deal, and again, this was a smart money move for a team that doesn't seem capable of making any mistakes at the moment. On Tuesday, Heyward tattooed a slider down and in and launched it over the right field wall, igniting LA's comeback.\n\nWhat to do with the Dodgers' dodgy pitching?\n\nThe Dodgers had a wildly stacked starting rotation entering 2024. In addition to bringing in Yamamoto and Tyler Glasnow, they figured to have Walker Buehler back from an injury-ravaged past two seasons. Buehler, however, has struggled immensely.\n\nBuehler allowed seven earned runs in just four innings of work as the Rockies gave him no reprieve on the night. Following that disastrous outing, Buehler now has an ERA of 4.64 with just 29 strikeouts in 33 innings of work. A hiatus may be on the way for Buehler so he could get himself right given how capable he is of pitching well when he's at his best.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intentional base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanGraphs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FanGraphs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Teoscar-Hernandez-after-hitting-a-single-vs-Padres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Ryan Feltner (1-6, 5.71 ERA) will be on the mound for the Rockies while Los Angeles is expected to activate Bobby Miller (1-1, 5.40) from the injured list to make his first start since April 10.\n\nMiller was shut down with right shoulder inflammation after his outing at Minnesota when he gave up two runs on five hits in four innings of work. He was placed on the IL three days later and started his rehab assignment on May 26.\n\nMiller said he was bothered by shoulder inflammation around the time of the team's trip to Seoul, South Korea, in March.\n\n\"I'm still trying to figure out what caused it,\" he told SportsNet LA on Tuesday. \"It all started right after Korea, and slowly just got a little bit worse, and started messing with my delivery a little bit, and mechanics were changing a little bit. I'm feeling 100 percent now, and just looking to stay that way the rest of the season.\"\n\nWednesday will be his second career start against Colorado. In his only other outing against the Rockies, which came at Coors Field on Sept. 26, 2023, he got the win with seven innings of two-run ball in the 11-inning game.\n\nFeltner is coming off an outing against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night in which he was tagged for three homers and four total runs over 6 2/3 innings. He left the game with back tightness but it wasn't severe enough to make him miss his turn in the rotation.\n\nHe has yet to win at home this season and is 0-2 with a 6.89 ERA in six starts at Coors Field.\n\nFeltner was the starter on April 30 at Miami, the first time this season Colorado took a five-run lead (5-0) into the ninth inning, only to lose 7-6 in 10 innings.\n\nTuesday night's loss was hard to swallow after it appeared Dodgers slugger Teoscar Hernandez struck out on a check swing with two outs in the top of the ninth and the Rockies leading 9-8, but he held up on appeal to first base umpire Lance Barksdale.\n\nHernandez then hit a three-run homer. That followed a pinch-hit grand slam by Jason Heyward in the same inning.\n\n\"It was a tough one for sure,\" manager Bud Black said. \"We've had some tough ones before but we've shown some resiliency, but this was a tough one.\"\n\nColorado likely will be without veteran Charlie Blackmon for the rest of the series. He left Tuesday night's game with a hamstring issue and is expected to be down for a few days.\n\n\"Charlie's sore. It's a hamstring strain to the extent we'll know in the next day or two,\" Black said. \"Because it's mild, that's a positive.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType":

Heyward's fourth homer of the season pulled the Dodgers within 9-8 with one out in the inning after trailing 7-2 after four innings.\n\nShohei Ohtani, who had a 476-foot homer in the fifth, singled off Victor Vodnik (1-1) before Will Smith struck out looking after attempting to step out of the batter's box on a 3-2 pitch.\n\nAfter a wild pitch, Freddie Freeman received an intentional walk, his sixth walk in the last two games, bringing up Hernandez. Hernandez took a half-swing at a 1-2 fastball, but first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that Hernandez did not commit. Colorado manager Bud Black argued the call and was ejected.\n\nOn the next pitch, Hernandez hit his 18th home to make it 11-9. After Hernandez's ball cleared the wall, Colorado right field Jake Cave immediately took a few steps toward Barksdale and began yelling. Rockies' second baseman Alan Trejo stepped between Cave and Barksdale after the inning ended.\n\nEvan Phillips got the only batter he faced, Hunter Goodman, to recorded his 11th save in as many chances. Cave, the on-deck hitter, was restrained by bench Mike Redmond as he attempted to reach Bardsdale.\n\nElehuris Montero and Brenton Doyle homered for the Rockies, who scored four runs in the first and twice led by five runs.\n\nDoyle added three singles for his first career four-hit game, scored twice, and made a diving catch of Ohtani's line drive to right-center field with runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh inning, preserving an 8-4 lead.\n\nDodgers starter Walker Buehler gave up eight hits and seven runs in four innings. It was the first time the 29-yeaer-old right-hander allowed more than three earned runs since returning to the rotation May 6 after missing the 2023 season because of Tommy John surgery.

He and Elehuris Montero singled to set the table for Adael Amador, who grounded into a force out at second\n\nThe game-winning run, which Cave scored directly in front of home plate umpire Lance Barksdale, tasted especially sweet. Cave was the Rockies' most furious player after Barksdale's missed call from first base on a check swing cost Colorado the final out of Tuesday's game.\n\nThe Rockies are 5-14 against the Dodgers since the start of the 2023 season. They will attempt to earn a four-game split Thursday in a matinee at Coors Field.\n\nThey earned another head start against their seemingly insurmountable division rival when Michael Toglia took Bobby Miller deep for a 3-0 first-inning lead. Toglia was on cycle watch after tripling his next at-bat, but that fizzled out by the end of a 2-for-4 night.\n\nThe Dodgers didn't need all nine innings to conjure a comeback this time. They only needed one opportunity. Shohei Ohtani, attracting an enthusiastic reception before every plate appearance, cleared the bases with a two-out double into the left-center alley. He scored on a Freddie Freeman single, and it was 4-3 Los Angeles by the bottom of the second.\n\nMiller shook off the early home run and settled in for the Dodgers in his first appearance since April 10, carrying a 6-4 lead into the seventh after Jason Heyward's go-ahead two-run double. But Dave Roberts might have left his starter on the mound a little too long. Miller gave up a leadoff double to Sean Bouchard then got the first out before exiting to a small ovation from Dodgers fans.\n\nDaniel Hudson's first pitch was grounded to third by Montero and bobbled by Cavan Biggio, a run-scoring error that breathed new life into Coors Field. The tying runner was on, and eventually around the bases after an Amador double and the first of Doyle's clutch productive outs. The final line for Miller included five earned runs.\n\nRockies pitcher Ryan Feltner gave up all of the Dodgers' six runs in a five-inning start, striking out six and walking two.\n\nBlackmon day-to-day\n\nCharlie Blackmon did not play in Wednesday's game due to right hamstring tightness, an injury Rockies manager Bud Black described as day-to-day moving forward. Black didn't rule out a Blackmon appearance when he spoke to reporters pregame, but he said the veteran designated hitter would \"probably not\" be available.\n\nBlackmon was removed from the game Tuesday after injuring his hamstring while running the bases. He was hit by a pitch in the first inning and advanced gingerly to third base after pulling up as he rounded second.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West

On a night where it seemed that Los Angeles was doomed by facing a 7-2 deficit in the early going, it was the Dodgers that continued to chip away and ultimately come out on top in dramatic fashion. Thanks to Teoscar Hernandez' game-altering three-run home run into the right-field bleachers in the top half of the ninth inning, the Dodgers were able to close the door and improve to 46-29 overall. With that mark, Los Angeles holds a commanding nine-game lead in the NL West division.\n\nIn the midst of a three-game losing streak, the Colorado Rockies were defeated devastatingly the last time they set foot on the diamond. After it appeared that the game was all but wrapped up after Hernandez could not check his swing with two strikes, the first-base umpire decided that he in fact held his swing. To the Rockies' dismay, it was Colorado that eventually surrendered a back-breaking three-run home run that cost them the game. As it stands, the Rox are a sluggish 25-48 and don't appear to be getting back into the thick of things anytime soon.\n\nFor obvious reasons, this Dodgers squad is the more dynamic and talented bunch in comparison to a Rockies franchise that is smack dab in the middle of a painful rebuilding phase. Thanks to Colorado's porous pitching numbers at high altitudes in their own ballpark, be on the lookout for LA to once again rip the cover off the baseball.\n\nAll in all, it begins with the Dodgers remaining patient in their at-bats and continuing to be pests when on the base paths. This isn't surprising, but the Dodgers happen to lead the majors in on-base percentage (.337) and also have the most walks in baseball. Thanks to these two statistics, the Dodgers tend to make life extremely difficult for opposing pitchers when occupying the bases when up to bat. Of course, the absence of outfielder Mookie Betts due to a fractured hand is absolutely devastating for this lineup, but there are plenty of names that can still do a plethora of damage in the thin air of the Mile High City.\n\nAbove all else, the chances of the Dodgers covering the spread will fall on the shoulders of starter Bobby Miller. Making his first start since April 10th after spending some time on the injured list with a bum shoulder, Los Angeles is excited to welcome him back with open arms. Although his season-long numbers don't pop out on paper, Miller is still more than capable of keeping Colorado hitters on their toes and off-balanced in this divisional contest.\n\nWhy The Rockies Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nHave the Rockies finally hit rock bottom? Most likely. At the moment, Colorado is starting down the barrel of another lost season as they are a whopping 23 games under .500. There have happened to be brief moments and glimpses where the Rockies have shown some promise with young guys who may end up making a different in years to come, but this is a team that lacks the talent and overall pizazz to be a contender.\n\nFor starters, Colorado's best chance to avoid getting swept on their home turf will come in the form of an offense that will want to get the part started in consecutive nights. On Tuesday, the Rockies did just that as they jumped out to a 7-2 lead, but everything fell apart shortly after. Getting a strong start is one thing, but closing the deal and keeping the pedal to the metal is another. All year long, the Rox have struggled mightily in finishing teams off in the later goings of ball games. Simply put, Colorado's bullpen may be one of the worst in baseball and they will need to somehow snap out of it later this evening.\n\nOffensively, keep tabs on some young but promising sluggers that exist in the Colorado lineup. In fact, be on the lookout for rising star Ezequiel Tovar and the solid third-baseman in Ryan McMahon to make some noise with the sticks. If they cannot, then it may end up being the Rockies who fall flat on their faces yet again.\n\nFinal Dodgers-Rockies Prediction & Pick\n\nWhile the value on the Rockies ML is tempting at +170 odds, it would be unwise to take Colorado in this one. Historically, the Dodgers are known to dominate the Rockies and that will once again be the case in the final game of this series.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Jason Heyward pinch-hit for Chris Taylor, and blasted a grand slam that put the Dodgers within one run.\n\nShohei Ohtani followed with a single, and Freddie Freeman walked to put the tying and go-ahead run on base with two outs. Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez then blasted a three-run homer to give the Dodgers 11 runs, capping off a seven-run inning.\n\nPrior to that point, the Dodgers scored their first run in the second inning when Andy Pages hit his eighth homer of the year. They added another in the third when Chris Taylor tripled and scored on a ground out from Shohei Ohtani.\n\nIn the sixth inning, Ohtani crushed a homer, his 20th of the year, which traveled 476 feet and left the bat at 113 mph. Miguel Vargas doubled to drive in Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez in the seventh inning, cutting the Rockies' lead to four runs.\n\nThe Dodgers had a chance to make the game closer with two on for Ohtani in the seventh. Ohtani roped a line drive into the gap, but Doyle made a diving catch, arguably one of the best you'll ever see, to end the threat.\n\nWalker Buehler turned in another bad outing, which proved to be his worst of the season by a considerable margin. He lasted just four innings, allowing seven runs on seven hits with two homers allowed, one walk and two strikeouts.\n\nBuehler has now allowed at least three runs in seven of his eight starts. Overall, he's 1-5 with a 5.84 ERA and 1.51 WHIP across 37 innings.\n\nThe Rockies did most of their damage in the first inning, scoring four runs on a hit-by-pitch, single, two doubles and a sacrifice fly. A two-run homer extended their lead in the second, and a solo shot added to their lead in the fourth.\n\nBuehler has attempted to make adjustments to his pitch mix, but the lack of strikeout stuff in his arsenal limits his upside.\n\nOnce Buehler was out of the game, the Rockies scored another off Yohan Ram\u00edrez.\n\nMichael Petersen pitched the seventh and eighth for the Dodgers, making his MLB debut after a long Minor League career. The 30-year-old is just the fourth British-born player in the last 33 years, and he became the first Dodgers player to wear No. 90 in a game.\n\nHe allowed a walk that led to a run scoring on a sac fly in his first frame, but struck out two in a scoreless eighth inning. Petersen ended up earning the win.\n\nEvan Phillips recorded the save.", "source": {"uri": "s22927.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "blake_williams@s22927.pcdn.co", "name": "Blake Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Vargas_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miguel Vargas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Taylor (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Hern\u00e1ndez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohan_Ram\u00edrez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yohan Ram\u00edrez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Running", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s22927.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Teoscar-Hernandez-Andy-Pages-Jason-Heyward-Dodgers-win-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

And the Dodgers got another solid outing from Gavin Stone, who pitched 5 1/3 innings.\n\nAfter Betts went down Sunday with a fractured left hand when he was hit by a pitch, it didn't take manager Dave Roberts long to decide to move Ohtani to the top spot in the batting order. Ohtani has made the move seamlessly, and has hit leadoff in all four games since.\n\n\"It was by default,\" Roberts said when asked about the move before the game. \"We had no one else. So, he's a perfect default. He's done it before. He's done it before. And honestly, he's swinging the bat well there, and he was starting to swing the batter better before that. So, he's just doing what he needs to do as far as controlling the zone.\"\n\nOhtani worked the count to 2-1 before driving Ty Blach's offering over the center-field fence for his 21st home run of the season. Andy Pages had a run-scoring double in the third and Smith and Freeman homered consecutively in the fourth, putting the Dodgers up 5-0. Teoscar Hernandez added three hits.\n\nOn the pitching side, Stone (8-2) was keeping the Rockies at bay and largely off the base paths. He pitched into the sixth inning, registering seven strikeouts and allowing two runs on four hits in a fourth consecutive winning decision.\n\nStone was sailing through the outing until the sixth, when he issued pair of walks around his seventh strikeout. After giving up a single to Elehuris Montero, Stone was relieved by Blake Treinen. Jake Cave hit a two-run single before Treinen got out of the jam by retiring Hunter Goodman and Alan Trejo.\n\nRyan McMahon homered off Alex Vesia leading off the eighth before Evan Phillips pitched a hitless ninth, striking out two for his 12th save.\n\nThe NL West-leading Dodgers have won five of seven games this season with the Rockies, who are mired in last place in the division.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dennis_georgatos@ocregister.com", "name": "Dennis Georgatos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Blach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Blach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elehuris_Montero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elehuris Montero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Trejo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Trejo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Vesia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Vesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cave", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McMahon_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McMahon (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Hunter_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Hunter (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Treinen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blake Treinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24172695418309.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Then, Will Smith struck out looking on a weird play in which it appeared he was trying to call timeout.

After a check swing with two strikes that was called a ball -- much to the dismay of Rockies manager Bud Black -- Hern\u00e1ndez crushed the next pitch he saw into the right field bleachers, completing the comeback and giving the Dodgers an 11-9 lead.\n\nAlex Vesia then got two outs in the ninth inning, before allowing a walk and being replaced by Evan Phillips. Phillips got the last out, and the Dodgers somehow won a game in which they trailed by five runs entering the ninth inning.\n\nThe Dodgers are now 2-0 without Mookie Betts, and are proving their resilience without the MVP favorite at the top of their lineup. The offense got behind Walker Buehler, who allowed seven earned runs in four innings. Ohtani also hit his 20th home run of the season.\n\nThe Dodgers moved to 46-29, but more importantly, proved they're never going to be out of a game.

He left the game with back tightness but it wasn't severe enough to make him miss his turn in the rotation.\n\nHe has yet to win at home this season and is 0-2 with a 6.89 ERA in six starts at Coors Field.\n\nFeltner was the starter on April 30 at Miami, the first time this season Colorado took a five-run lead (5-0) into the ninth inning, only to lose 7-6 in 10 innings.\n\nTuesday night's loss was hard to swallow after it appeared Dodgers slugger Teoscar Hernandez struck out on a check swing with two outs in the top of the ninth and the Rockies leading 9-8, but he held up on appeal to first base umpire Lance Barksdale.\n\nHernandez then hit a three-run homer. That followed a pinch-hit grand slam by Jason Heyward in the same inning.\n\n\"It was a tough one for sure,\" manager Bud Black said. \"We've had some tough ones before but we've shown some resiliency, but this was a tough one.\"\n\nColorado likely will be without veteran Charlie Blackmon for the rest of the series. He left Tuesday night's game with a hamstring issue and is expected to be down for a few days.\n\n\"Charlie's sore. It's a hamstring strain to the extent we'll know in the next day or two,\" Black said. \"Because it's mild, that's a positive.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He and Elehuris Montero singled to set the table for Adael Amador, who grounded into a force out at second\n\nThe game-winning run, which Cave scored directly in front of home plate umpire Lance Barksdale, tasted especially sweet. Cave was the Rockies' most furious player after Barksdale's missed call from first base on a check swing cost Colorado the final out of Tuesday's game.\n\nThe Rockies are 5-14 against the Dodgers since the start of the 2023 season. They will attempt to earn a four-game split Thursday in a matinee at Coors Field.\n\nThey earned another head start against their seemingly insurmountable division rival when Michael Toglia took Bobby Miller deep for a 3-0 first-inning lead. Toglia was on cycle watch after tripling his next at-bat, but that fizzled out by the end of a 2-for-4 night.\n\nThe Dodgers didn't need all nine innings to conjure a comeback this time. They only needed one opportunity. Shohei Ohtani, attracting an enthusiastic reception before every plate appearance, cleared the bases with a two-out double into the left-center alley. He scored on a Freddie Freeman single, and it was 4-3 Los Angeles by the bottom of the second.\n\nMiller shook off the early home run and settled in for the Dodgers in his first appearance since April 10, carrying a 6-4 lead into the seventh after Jason Heyward's go-ahead two-run double. But Dave Roberts might have left his starter on the mound a little too long. Miller gave up a leadoff double to Sean Bouchard then got the first out before exiting to a small ovation from Dodgers fans.\n\nDaniel Hudson's first pitch was grounded to third by Montero and bobbled by Cavan Biggio, a run-scoring error that breathed new life into Coors Field. The tying runner was on, and eventually around the bases after an Amador double and the first of Doyle's clutch productive outs. The final line for Miller included five earned runs.\n\nRockies pitcher Ryan Feltner gave up all of the Dodgers' six runs in a five-inning start, striking out six and walking two.\n\nBlackmon day-to-day with a hamstring injury\n\nCharlie Blackmon did not play in Wednesday's game due to right hamstring tightness, an injury Rockies manager Bud Black described as day-to-day moving forward. Black didn't rule out a Blackmon appearance when he spoke to reporters pregame, but he said the veteran designated hitter would \"probably not\" be available.\n\nBlackmon was removed from the game Tuesday after injuring his hamstring while running the bases. He was hit by a pitch in the first inning and advanced gingerly to third base after pulling up as he rounded second.\n\nRockies left fielder Nolan Jones was also scratched from the lineup before the first pitch due to illness. Batting sixth in his place, Bouchard went 1 for 3 with a run and an RBI.\n\n\u00a92024 MediaNews Group, Inc. Visit at denverpost.com.

And he deftly handled his defensive chores in the field. Jason Heyward had a two-run single among his three hits and Freddie Freeman drew a career-high five walks, scoring twice. Will Smith had a run-scoring triple, Teoscar Hernandez added an RBI double and Cavan Biggio had an RBI single.\n\nIt was more than enough for James Paxton (7-1), who allowed one run on two hits in seven innings in his second straight strong outing since absorbing his only loss of the season on June 5, when he couldn't get out of the second inning as part of a 10-6 defeat at Pittsburgh.\n\nPaxton had eight strikeouts and finished with a flourish, striking out the side in his final inning. The only real damage the Rockies managed to inflict on Paxton was Jacob Stallings' leadoff home run in the second inning. J.P. Feyereisen relieved Paxton to start the eighth and was one out away from finishing when pinch-hitter Greg Jones homered for his first major league hit.\n\nMichael Toglia and Elehuris Montero then hit successive doubles and Hunter Goodman homered before Feyereisen fanning Alan Trejo for the game's final out.\n\nLeading 5-0, the Dodgers added two more runs in the eighth. Ohtani started the inning by drawing a walk, stole second on a play that survived replay review, and then went to third when reliever Geoff Hartlieb was called for a balk. One out later, Freeman was walked intentionally. Hernandez also walked to load the bases before Heyward came on to deliver a two-out, two-run single to right.\n\nGavin Lux had an RBI double in the ninth and Smith drove in his second run of the night with a sacrifice fly. Freeman, with a chance to tie the major league record with a sixth walk, worked the count to 2-and-2 against Justin Lawrence before singling sharply to right, extending his hitting streak to seven games.\n\nThe Dodgers took command early against Colorado starter Cal Quantrill, scoring three times in the first two innings. And they finished strong, scoring six runs in the final three innings.\n\nQuantrill (6-5) went five innings and allowed three runs on seven hits.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dennis_georgatos@ocregister.com", "name": "Dennis Georgatos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paxton_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Paxton (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Rojas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miguel Rojas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Feyereisen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Rockies Game Preview: Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez Starting After Early Removal", "body": "The Los Angeles Dodgers have another shot for a series win at Coors Field following their 7-6 loss in the final inning on Wednesday night against the Colorado Rockies.\n\nThe Dodgers have Gavin Stone on the mound making his first career start at Coors Field. Stone has faced the Rockies one time in his career and that came on June 2 at Dodger Stadium. He was credited with the win in that game after pitching five scoreless innings with 6 strikeouts.\n\nStone's development has continued to be one of the most compelling storylines for the Dodgers this season. He owns a 7-2 record with a 3.01 ERA, 56 strikeouts and 1.21 WHIP in 74.2 innings this season.\n\nThe Dodgers will be looking to get some length from Stone with a weakened bullpen and decently high usage the past two games. Stone has had a knack for pitching deep into games this season, and it's something Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has given him credit for.\n\nThe Rockies are countering with left-hander Ty Blach, who is making his 12th start of the season. Blach owns a 3-3 record with a 5.06 ERA in his last seven games, and has a 4.65 ERA and 1.41 WHIP in 50.1 innings overall.\n\nHe excels at limiting walks but not much else, and mostly utilizes a sinker and changeup with the occasional cutter and curveball. He is a bit of a contradiction on the mound as he is not a big strikeout threat, but does generate a good amount of chase from batters.\n\nIn three games without Mookie Betts, the Dodgers offense has been able to be productive with 26 runs in the series so far, though the hitter-friendly confines of Coors Field certainly help.\n\nTeoscar Hern\u00e1ndez is back in the Dodgers lineup after leaving the game in the seventh inning on Wednesday. Roberts said it was to get Hern\u00e1ndez some rest, but it was unusual in a two-run game.\n\nWith the lefty on the mound, Chris Taylor and Miguel Vargas also get a start, replacing Gavin Lux and Jason Heyward.", "source": {"uri": "dodgerblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sebastian_abdon_ibarra@dodgerblue.com", "name": "Sebastian Abd\u00f3n Ibarra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Roberts (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Blach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Blach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Taylor (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s22927.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Teoscar-Hernandez-Clayton-McCullough-Dodgers-celebration.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 325, "textEnd": 331}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Shohei Ohtani stepped into the leadoff spot and went 3 for 5 with a walk in the Dodgers' 9-5 victory over the Rockies at Coors Field. Colorado will look for revenge in Game 2 of the four-game series on Tuesday.\n\nWalker Buehler hasn't quite found his stride this season, posting a 1-4 record with a 4.64 ERA. His performance at Coors Field is unlikely to improve those numbers. He's 3-1 with a 4.89 ERA in 11 games (nine starts) in the Mile High stadium in his career. Despite the injury to Betts, the Dodgers still boast a potent offense despite injuries. With Austin Gomber (1-4, 4.26 ERA) showing signs of regression, the Dodgers should find some success. My prediction: the total runs will surpass 12.\n\n* The Dodger bullpen has been exceptional recently, with an ERA of 2.43 in their last 50 games, second-best in MLB. Their season ERA of 3.14 also ranks second in the Majors.\n\n* Ohtani continues to impress with a .944 OPS in June, even though it's a slight notch below his .988 OPS for the season.

On the sixth pitch of his at-bat, Jason Heyward launched a pinch-hit grand slam to bring the Dodgers within a run.\n\nA few batters later, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez stepped in with two on and two outs. Rockies reliever Victor Vodnick got ahead in a 1-and-2 count and fired a fastball above the strike zone, inducing a questionable no-call on a check swing.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez homered on the next pitch, giving the Dodgers an 11-9 lead and eventual win. That enraged Jake Cave, who voiced his anger with first base umpire Lance Barksdale's call on the appeal that ultimately swung the game, per Scotty Gange of 9News Denver:\n\n\"I had Lance look me right in the face and tell me, I mean I was yelling at him from right during the inning, but then when we made the last out, I'm running in and he looks at me right in the face and goes, 'Cave, it's not even close.' So that's when I really got pissed. Are you that out of tune with the game to where you're going to tell me it's not close? Everybody in the world can see that it was at least close. That game is won on that swing. That's a swing and miss and the game is won and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers. So yeah, I'm pissed.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black was ejected from the game for arguing with Barksdale on his check-swing call. Cave initially watched the flight of Hern\u00e1ndez's opposite-field drive before turning back toward the infield to shout as Barksdale as the ball carried over the fence.\n\nCave continued to accost Barksdale on his way to the dugout between innings but he was not ejected. Cave released even more frustration once Evan Phillips sealed the Dodgers' dramatic comeback win with a strikeout.\n\nFrom multiple replays, it appeared Hern\u00e1ndez went far enough into a swinging motion that has garnered a call for going around in other instances and Barksdale erred.\n\nBut fact of the matter is the Dodgers scored seven runs in ninth inning for an improbable comeback that shouldn't have come down to an umpire's call anyhow.", "source": {"uri": "dodgerblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_geirman@dodgerblue.com", "name": "Scott Geirman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Rojas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miguel Rojas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Barksdale", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lance Barksdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Black", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bud Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Caving", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Caving", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Outdoor_Play", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Outdoor Play", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s22927.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alan-Trejo-Jake-Cave-umpire-Lance-Barksdal.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

But that didn't keep the Dodgers from feeling right at home. Per usual.\n\nBehind a strong start from rookie right-hander Gavin Stone, and homers from the top three hitters in their lineup -- All-Stars Shohei Ohtani, Will Smith and Freddie Freeman -- the Dodgers beat the Rockies 5-3 to clinch the four-game series.\n\nSince 2018, Los Angeles is 74-33 vs. Colorado.\n\nDown 5-0 after five innings, the Rockies made a game of it, and Ryan McMahon had an All-Star kind of day. In the sixth, he channeled his inner Brooks Robinson, digging out Miguel Rojas' grounder down the third-base line and rocketing a throw to first to get Rojas by a half-step.\n\nMcMahon led off the eighth with a 462-foot blast to the second deck above the bullpens in right field to cut the lead to 5-3. McMahon turned on lefty Alex Vesia's 2-0 fastball for his team-high 13th homer.\n\nStone dominated Colorado for the first five innings, however, allowing no runs on three hits. He lost his mojo in the sixth, issuing a leadoff walk to Sean Bouchard, a one-out walk to Michael Toglia and a single to Elehuris Montero to load the bases.\n\nManager Dave Roberts saw the writing on the wall and replaced Stone with Blake Treinen, who promptly gave up a two-run single to Jake Cave.

Over his previous nine starts, he was 6-1 with a 2.06 ERA.\n\nRockies veteran left-hander Ty Blach is a pitch-to-contact pitcher. Sometimes, his style works, and sometimes, it doesn't. Thursday, it most definitely did not. The Dodgers blasted Blach for five runs on 10 hits, including the solo homers by Ohtani to lead off the game and back-to-back blasts by Smith and Freeman in the fourth.\n\nBlach entered the game with a solid track record against the Dodgers, going 4-3 with a 3.13 ERA in 20 appearances (nine starts).

After another rough outing in which he allowed seven runs and saw his ERA climb to 5.84, Buehler hinted at the possibility of taking a temporary break before his next start to reset. A potential stint on the injured list could provide necessary recovery time.\n\nIn beating the Rockies 11-9, the Dodgers staged one of the most remarkable comebacks of the season. Trailing by five runs entering the ninth inning, the team rallied spectacularly. The key hits: a grand slam by Jason Heyward and a three-run homer by Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nOn Aug. 28, the Dodgers will be giving away a second Ohtani bobblehead when the team welcomes the Baltimore Orioles into Dodger Stadium -- but this one doesn't only feature Ohtani.\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Gomes doesn't appear to feel that the injuries to Mookie Betts and Yoshinobu Yamamoto warrant a re-evaluation of the Dodgers' trade deadline strategy, perhaps because both players are anticipated to return by the end of the regular season.\n\nAfter a significant period on the injured list, Bobby Miller is set to make his return to the mound Wednesday. Having last pitched for the Dodgers in April, Miller's comeback is keenly awaited as he looks to shake off previous struggles and solidify his spot in the rotation. His minor league rehab outings were like a second preseason, and hopefully set up Miller for a strong second half.\n\nPhoto Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports", "source": {"uri": "dodgersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodgers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_camras@dodgersnation.com", "name": "Noah Camras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Yamamoto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Gomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Gomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://dodgersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USATSI_13012132_168396005_lowres-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-28", "textStart": 1024, "textEnd": 1031}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

With the Dodgers holding a 6-4 lead entering the seventh inning, manager Dave Roberts pulled Hern\u00e1ndez in favor of Chris Taylor.\n\nRoberts was actually considering having Hern\u00e1ndez get a rest day during the team's series against the Colorado Rockies. Hern\u00e1ndez has yet to get a full day off this season, but has pulled from multiple games early to help his endurance for the season.\n\n\"Coming into this series, I was considering giving him a day off,\" Roberts said, via Jack Harris of the Los Angeles Times ... \"I felt like having CT out there to give Teo a few innings off his feet could be beneficial going into a day game [on Thursday],\" Roberts said, noting that Hern\u00e1ndez \"could help us win a game tomorrow.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the Dodgers, their lead was not large enough to nail down a win Wednesday. After Hern\u00e1ndez left the game, the Rockies scored two runs in the seventh inning and one more in the ninth to win 7-6.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez has been a crucial force in the Dodgers' lineup all season, with 18 home runs and 54 RBIs, making his absence at the end of the game tough for the Dodgers as they tried to secure the win. Taylor has struggled greatly, slashing .115/.211/.177 this season.\n\nOf course, removing Hern\u00e1ndez from the game isn't the only reason the Dodgers lost. Yohan Ramirez was called on in the ninth inning to preserve a 6-6 tie and could not hold it down.\n\nOne loss likely won't cost the Dodgers in the long run, and it's most important for the team to have their key players like Hern\u00e1ndez healthy for the end of the year and postseason.\n\nPhoto Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports", "source": {"uri": "dodgersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodgers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eva_geitheim@dodgersnation.com", "name": "Eva Geitheim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Taylor (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://dodgersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USATSI_23506875_168396005_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Spiced with controversy and fury.\n\nThe Rockies were one strike away from pulling out a 9-8 victory over the Dodgers on Tuesday night at Coors Field. And the Rockies were 100% certain they got the strike three they needed on Victor Vodnik's 99.8 mph fastball to Teoscar Hernandez.\n\nInstead, the Rockies lost 11-9, as the Dodgers erupted for seven runs in the ninth, topped off by Hernandez's three-run homer one pitch later.\n\nHernandez checked his swing on Vodnik's two-strike pitch and the Rockies appealed to first-base umpire Lance Barksdale, positive Hernandez had swung to end the game. To no avail.\n\nManager Bud Black went ballistic and immediately got tossed. Rockies right-fielder Jake Cave went ballistic, too, and had to be restrained from going after Barksdale.\n\nWhen all the fire and smoke cleared, Colorado's incredibly unstable bullpen cost them another game. Earlier in the inning, Jason Heyward launched a pinch-hit grand slam homer off Tyler Kinley. Heyward's blast clanged off the right-field foul pole and set the stage for Hernandez's blast.\n\nColorado wasted a brilliant game by center fielder Brenton Doyle.\n\nThe Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani might be the world's favorite baseball superhero, and yes, he launched a majestic 476-foot home run, but he was no match for Doyle. With the Rockies clinging to an 8-4 lead, Doyle played Superman for the final out of the seventh inning.\n\nThe Rockies' center fielder went airborne to rob Ohtani of an extra-base hit that would have driven in two runs and might have resulted in a triple -- perhaps even an inside-the-park homer. The ball rocketed off Ohtani's bat at 111.7 mph.\n\nDoyle put some sugar on his sweet catch with a career-high four hits, including a one-out solo homer in the fourth off Walker Buehler.\n\nColorado also got a needed boost from starter Austin Gomber, who put the brakes on his June swoon.\n\nYes, the lefty served up the epic solo homer to Ohtani in the sixth inning -- a blast that prompted oohs and ahs from the crowd. And Gomber also gave up a solo homer to Andy Page in the second. But Gomber provided Colorado the start it needed to topple the powerhouse Dodgers.\n\nGomber had a magnificent May, going 1-0 with a 0.68 ERA in four starts. But during his first three starts in June, all on the road, he was 0-2 with a 12.27 ERA. Last Wednesday at Minnesota, the Twins ambushed Gomber's off-speed pitches and blasted him for eight runs on a career-high tying 11 hits in just three innings.\n\nBut Gomber gave the Rockies 6 2/3 innings Tuesday night, allowing four runs on five hits. He struck out three and walked two. He was in line to pitch seven innings but gave up a two-out walk to Kike Hernandez and an RBI double to Miguel Vargas as the Dodgers whittled the lead to 8-4.\n\nLeft reliever Jalen Beeks took over and promptly walked Chris Taylor, setting the stage for Doyle's highlight-reel catch of Ohtani's liner.\n\nColorado's offense has sputtered most of the season, but it produced 11 hits, including seven off Buehler, who was charged with seven runs in just four innings.\n\nThe Rockies jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first, the big hits an RBI double by Ezequiel Tovar, immediately followed by a two-run double by Ryan McMahon.\n\nIn that first inning, veteran designated hitter Charlie Blackmon injured his leg running the bases.

Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers were outplayed by the Colorado Rockies in several key areas on Monday, and yet they still came away with a comfortable victory.\n\nThe Dodgers left 13 runners on base. Los Angeles committed an error, while Colorado played a clean game in the field. Coors Field played friendlier to the home team as well, with the Rockies hitting three home runs to the Dodgers' zero.\n\nStill, Los Angeles got out to a 9-1 lead and went on to win 9-5.\n\nAccording to OptaSTATS, the Dodgers became the first team in the live-ball era to win a game by multiple runs despite getting outhomered by three, stranding 10-plus men on base and committing more errors than their opponent.\n\nSeven different Dodgers had an RBI. One of the two starters who didn't was first baseman Freddie Freeman, who contributed to the historic win with a unique stat line of his own.\n\nFreeman went 1-for-1 with five walks and two runs. His five walks tied the Dodgers' franchise record for most in a nine-inning game, per MLB.com's Sarah Langs, matching the mark posted by Dusty Baker in 1980 and Gene Hermanski in 1949.\n\nOn top of that, Underdog Fantasy's Justin Havens noted that Freeman became first MLB player to record five walks and one hit in a game since Rougned Odor in 2018. It hadn't been done by a National League player since Tony Campana in 2013 or by a Dodger since Hermanski in 1949.\n\nThrough 74 games this season, Freeman is batting .302 with 10 home runs, 43 RBI, a .916 OPS and a 2.9 WAR.

It ended an eight-hit, three-walk series for one of the sport's most lethal hitters and fellow former MVP Freddie Freeman added his long ball as part of back-to-back jacks for Los Angeles in the fourth inning.\n\nThe Dodgers have won 73 of their last 107 matchups against the Rockies since 2018.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the losing series and the moments that mattered most:\n\nThe Moment:\n\n-- Jake Cave's reaction told the story.\n\nHe ran to the right-field wall as we watched Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez's hit fly into Colorado's bullpen and take the team's lead with it. On the pitch before the home run, Victor Vodnik looked to have his first career save.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez checked his swing, and on appeal to umpire Lance Barksdale, the call was a non-swing. It would've been the Dodgers' third strike and out of the ninth, ending their chances at a ninth-inning comeback. Instead, the Rockies set modern-era history.\n\nIt was the sixth time this year that Colorado has entered the ninth inning with a lead and allowed five or more runs to blow it -- Tuesday was the third time the Rockies have allowed at least six. As the fifth, sixth and seventh runs jogged across the plate, Cave yelled at Barksdale from right field. It continued as he came in after the eventual third out and extended to postgame when the veteran continued to plead his reliever's case.\n\n\"I'm down the right-field line, the same as Lance, and I didn't even think it was close,\" Cave said after the loss. \"I was pissed, it's a big game (against) one of the best teams in baseball and we're battling with them, we're beating them. That game's won on that swing, that's a swing, and the game's won and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, he crossed home plate as the winning run after Brenton Doyle's first walk-off on a sacrifice fly. Barksdale called balls and strikes, and the two shared an unwelcome reunion. It came after he led off the ninth with a single through the left side.\n\n\"It's serendipitous,\" manager Bud Black said after Wednesday's win. \"That's sort of the magic of baseball, right? Good for Jake, he had a good game. Just a pro-at-bat to get us going.\"\n\nTakeaway:\n\n-- Colorado's pieces are largely homegrown as it progresses in its rebuild. Those pieces are beginning to build a bond.\n\nCave's emotional reaction to Vodnik giving up a go-ahead home run was his way of supporting the rookie reliever. Doyle's wife helped retrieve Greg Jones' first home run ball (more on that later) and the Rockies used the emotions of Tuesday's loss to propel them to a comeback win the following day.\n\nBlack's ejection from arguing for Vodnik was another sign of his growing relationship with the group.\n\n\"It's awesome to have that support,\" Vodnik said. \"Seeing Cave get fired up like that got me going. It's good to know they have your back -- your manager and your teammates have your back. It's nice to know that my guys got me.\"\n\nPlayer's card games have increased throughout the year and conversation as too. It seems like a new face is added weekly if only for a little while -- Jones and Adael Amador's recent debuts continued the trend that Jordan Beck and Anthony Molina started earlier in the year.\n\nThe Rockies were once led by a tight-knit group that included Nolan Arenado, Trevor Story, D.J. LeMahieu and Charlie Blackmon on offense and a pitching core highlighted by Kyle Freeland and Germ\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez's bond at the top.\n\nColorado is hoping recent emotions and actions can help fuse a similar bond. It looks to be working.\n\nWhat went right:\n\n-- The Doyle family's quick thinking paid off, and just like Cave returning a favor, the baseball gods seemingly gave one to Brenton.\n\nHis wife, Rose, was quick to action on Monday. Greg Jones hit his first career home run in the loss, and she darted to the right-field concourse when it landed. She caught the recipient and begged for a trade. She offered signed bats, balls, and whatever it would take to get the rookie's milestone ball for his family -- Jones' mother, sister and girlfriend have traveled to follow his games since his June 6 debut.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nThe offers were rejected, and the fan gave her the ball without argument for the \"easiest transaction of (her) life.\" In postgame interviews, it was perched in the locker behind Jones, ready to be given to his family.\n\n\"I just hope that if it were my husband or boyfriend, someone else would do the same thing,\" Rose said on the Rockies' broadcast. \"He was so appreciative.\"\n\nJones went to the team's family room after the game to introduce himself and thank Rose for her quick reflexes -- she had a little help from Sydney, Hunter Goodman's wife, who pointed out quickly that it was his first.\n\nDoyle benefitted on Tuesday with his first four-hit game and then again on Wednesday with his first career walk-off. He even added a catch-of-the-year candidate when he robbed Shohei Ohtani of an extra-base hit that would've brought the Dodgers within two runs in the seventh inning of Tuesday's loss.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\n-- Adael Amador knew as soon as he swung that something was wrong.\n\nHe made a hearty hack on a seventh-inning fastball and was forced out of Thursday's loss. He looked hobbled on his right side, and Black announced after the game that he has a mild oblique strain, like the one he suffered in Double-A Hartford in May.\n\nThe Rockies' No. 1 prospect became the youngest player in franchise history to reach base three times in a game in Wednesday's win. He hit .171 in his first 35 career at-bats.\n\nBrendan Rodgers was already nearing a return from his left hamstring strain. He was scheduled to play in Thursday's Triple-A Albuquerque matchup with Oklahoma City as part of a two-game rehab trip. He would likely join the active roster if Adael needed an injured-list stint.\n\n-- The Rockies' pitching staff played with fire and Los Angeles burned them.\n\nThey issued eight walks in Monday's loss. Then it was a grand slam and three-run home run in the ninth inning on Tuesday, thanks in part to three more walks. Los Angeles drew 23 free passes in four games if you include hit by pitches.\n\nColorado allowed 31 runs in the series despite having its top two pitchers -- Cal Quantrill and Austin Gomber -- throw in the first two games.\n\nThe Rockies will be reinforced soon with the health of Freeland and M\u00e1rquez who are both slated to be back in the rotation by the end of next month. Their bullpen recently welcomed Justin Lawrence and Jake Bird back and could eventually bring Lucas Gilbreath. Top prospects Carson Palmquist and Jaden Hill could also factor into the mix as the season goes on.\n\nColorado needs a solution to its free-pass problem. It's exacerbating a talent gap between teams like the Rockies and Dodgers and will need to be fixed if the club hopes to contend in future years.\n\nWhat's up next:\n\n-- The Rockies wrap up their season-long 10-game homestand with a three-game set against Washington.\n\nThey went 3-4 in the team's season series each of the last two years and will meet a 2024 Nationals club in a similar rebuild. They dealt Juan Soto for new headliners C.J. Abrams and MacKenzie Gore with prospect James Wood on the brink of a debut. Luckily for Colorado, it will miss Gore after the lefty started on Thursday against Arizona.\n\nDodgers 5, Rockies 3\n\nWhat happened: Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Will Smith each homered to sink the Rockies' chances of a series split in their sixth loss in the last eight games.\n\nOn the mound: Ty Blach dealt was dealt typical Dodgers damage. He allowed five earned runs on 10 hits and a walk in four innings to raise his earned run average to 5.13. Anthony Molina helped cool them with three scoreless innings to lower his to 5.97.\n\nAt the plate: Ryan McMahon took a ball 462 feet to center field to do a majority of Colorado's damage. The solo shot was his team-high 13th. The Rockies didn't get their first baserunner to second base until the fifth inning when Adael Amador singled to move Alan Trejo. The former exited after a swing in the seventh inning with a mild oblique strain.\n\nWhat's next: Washington Nationals (LHP DJ Herz, 1-1) at Colorado Rockies (RHP Dakota Hudson, 2-9) at 6:40 p.m. on

It was Ohtani's 21st long ball of the season, and he has now hit six homers in his last 10 games.\n\nIn the third inning, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez singled, and he was driven home on a double from Andy Pages to double the Dodgers' lead. Pages then came around to score on a single from Miguel Vargas, making it 3-0.\n\nThe Dodgers increased their lead in the fourth inning with back-to-back home runs from Will Smith and Freddie Freeman, giving them a 5-0 lead.\n\nIt was the fifth time this season the Dodgers have gone back-to-back, with Freeman and Smith accounting for two of them. Freeman and Ohtani have done it the other three times.\n\nGavin Stone turned in another strong outing, but started to fall off a bit near the end of his start. Stone worked five scoreless innings before he ran into some trouble in the sixth inning, which led to him coming out of the game and the Rockies scoring their only runs.\n\nStone started the inning with two walks and a strikeout before a single loaded the bases. Blake Treinen was then called on to replace Stone, who had thrown just 77 pitches.\n\nJake Cave immediately greeted Treinen with a single, allowing two runs to score, both of which were credited to Stone. However, Treinen was able to end the threat with two ground outs after that.\n\nStone finished his day with 5.1 innings pitched, allowing two runs on four hits with seven strikeouts and two walks.\n\nDaniel Hudson pitched a scoreless seventh and Alex Vesia allowed a solo home run to Ryan McMahon in the eight inning. Evan Phillips recorded the save.\n\nAlso of note, Chris Taylor had a two-hit game for the first time in 2024, and he also swiped two bags in the process. Taylor has seemed to be more comfortable at the plate recently, and noted it was a relief to hit his first home run of the season last week.\n\nHis overall numbers are still not ideal, but in his last seven games, he's hitting .294/.368/.588.", "source": {"uri": "s22927.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "blake_williams@s22927.pcdn.co", "name": "Blake Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Treinen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blake Treinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Vesia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Vesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cave", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McMahon_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McMahon (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Taylor (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s22927.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Will-Smith-Dodgers-celebration.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers rallied to beat the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night in historic fashion, overcoming a five-run deficit in the top of the ninth inning.\n\nHowever, the game was also historic for one individual Dodgers' player: Michael Petersen.\n\nThe right-hander became the first British-born Dodgers player in team history, according to popular UK baseball account @BatFlips_nerds:\n\nLast night Michael Petersen made his major league debut becoming the first British born Dodger ever and the first British born player in MLB since PJ Conlon on July 10th 2018.\n\nHe picked up a Win on his debut, striking out 2 over 2 innings. Here's some highlights from the outing.\n\nThe 30-year-old is from Middlesex, England and was drafted in the 2012 draft out of Riverside City College. He has spent parts of eight seasons in the minor leagues with the Brewers, Rockies and Dodgers. He's 10-11 in his minor league career with a 4.04 ERA. He threw in 167 minor league contests.\n\nWe see a few of these every season and it's just another example of great perseverance. Furthermore, Petersen is helping to continue grow the game in the United Kingdom. He was a part of the 2023 Great Britain roster at the World Baseball Classic a well.\n\nAfter the win, the Dodgers are now 46-29 and continue to lead the National League West. The Rockies are 25-48 and continue to be a bottom-three team in all of baseball.\n\nThe Dodgers and Rockies will play again Wednesday with first pitch at 8:40 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelback_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camelback Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_City_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riverside City College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Baseball_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Baseball Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3846,h_2163,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01j0rw5eq2py6rq6vhhm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-07-10", "textStart": 698, "textEnd": 712}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Shohei Ohtani had a three-run double and Jason Heyward a two-run double to help the Dodgers' offense but they couldn't quite fend off the Colorado Rockies, who got a ninth-inning sacrifice fly from Brenton Doyle off of Yohan Ramirez for a 7-6 victory on Wednesday night.\n\nThe loss snapped the Dodgers' three-game winning streak.\n\nThe Dodgers reinstated Miller to the active roster prior to the game, filling the roster vacancy created by placing struggling starter Walker Buehler on the injured list. Walker took a line drive off his hip during another erratic outing on Tuesday night in which he was tagged for a season-high seven runs in four innings. And overall, he has had difficulty regaining his pitching form after missing nearly two years while recovering from a second Tommy John surgery. The Dodgers also lost starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto to injury last weekend.\n\nMiller registered two quick outs to start the game but then allowed a single to Ryan McMahon and walked Jacob Stallings before Michael Toglia got to him for a three-run homer. Toglia tripled to lead off the fourth and scored on a groundout by Sean Bouchard.\n\nThe Dodgers scored four runs in the top of the second to go in front, with Ohtani delivering a bases-loaded double to tie the score and Freddie Freeman adding an RBI single.\n\nThe Dodgers went in front 6-4 when Heyward lifted a two-run double to right in the fifth but they couldn't hold the lead. Miller gave up a leadoff double to Bouchard in the seventh and after retiring Jake Cave on a groundout, he was relieved by Daniel Hudson.\n\nThird baseman Cavan Biggio booted Elehuris Montero's grounder for an error, and Bouchard scored from third. Doyle's sacrifice fly for the Rockies tied the score again at 6-all.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dennis_georgatos@ocregister.com", "name": "Dennis Georgatos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bouchard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Bouchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elehuris_Montero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elehuris Montero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Toglia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Toglia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan_Biggio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cavan Biggio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McMahon_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McMahon (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Stallings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Stallings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24172096108822.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-10", "textStart": 182, "textEnd": 190}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

They won 11-9, completing one of the wildest comebacks in franchise history.\n\nIt was the first time since the franchise moved to Los Angeles in 1958 that they pulled off a comeback win when trailing by five or more runs in the ninth inning. Entering the final frame, the Dodgers had a 0.5 percent chance of winning.\n\nAnd, if that wasn't enough history to make in one night, the Dodgers also became the first team in Major League Baseball history to hit a grand slam and a three-run home run while trailing in the ninth inning or later of the same game.\n\n\"We always talk about it here in the clubhouse: Don't give away at-bats,\" said Dodgers outfielder Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez. \"Fight through the at-bats, see a lot of pitches, and try to get a good one.\"\n\nJason Heyward knew Colorado reliever Tyler Kinley threw with velocity. He studied the first fastball and slider he saw. He fought off the second slider and was ready for another.\n\n\"I just told myself, 'All right, you got a feel for the take, you got a feel for the swing,'\" Heyward said. \"Just right there, take your time. If it's there, it's there. If it's not, tip my cap.\"\n\nHe got a 2-2 slider on the inside corner and drove into the right-field foul pole. Momentum officially shifted in the Dodgers' direction with one swing. Shohei Ohtani followed it up with a single and Freddie Freeman was intentionally walked to set up the moment for Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez was given a reprieve when his two-strike check swing was called a ball. On the very next pitch, Hern\u00e1ndez lofted one to deep right-center field. He immediately flipped his bat and pounded his chest turning the 0.5 percent probability of winning into a 91.6 percent chance.\n\n\"In those situations, I just want to get a good pitch to hit to tie the game with a man on second,\" Hern\u00e1ndez smiled. \"I put a little extra and it went over the fence.\"\n\nPhoto Credit: Isaiah J.

He pulled up lame running from first to third base in the first inning and jogged gingerly home before leaving.\n\nFellow starter Brendan Rodgers is already on the injured list with a left hamstring strain. Sean Bouchard played a rehab game with Triple-A Albuquerque on Tuesday and could be a potential replacement if Blackmon needs an injured list stint.\n\nDodgers 11, Rockies 9\n\nWhat happened: The Rockies scored early and often to back Austin Gomber's revenge start before Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez's home run in the ninth cost them.\n\nOn the mound: Gomber was bit by the long ball but kept the pain down. He allowed four earned runs on five hits, including a 476-foot blast by Shohei Ohtani across 6\u2154 innings to bring his season earned run average to 4.36. Jalen Beeks used a highlight catch from Doyle to hold the Dodgers scoreless in 1\u2153 innings. Tyler Kinley only got one out before Jason Heyward hit a grand slam off him in the ninth. He exited and Victor Vodnik came in to nearly earn a save before Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez's check swing and subsequent three-run home run pegged him with the loss.\n\nAt the plate: Brenton Doyle hit his seventh homer two innings later in the fourth as part of a career-high four hits. Elehuris Montero entered to replace Charlie Blackmon who left with right hamstring tightness. He hit his fourth homer in his first at-bat for the first pinch-hit long ball of his career and had another single. Ryan McMahon had a pair of doubles and Ezequiel Tovar added his 23rd. The Rockies collected 11 hits and five walks.\n\nWhat's next: Los Angeles Dodgers (RHP Bobby Miller, 1-1; 5.40 ERA) at Colorado Rockies (RHP Ryan Feltner, 1-6; 5.71 ERA) at 6:40 p.m. on Wednesday at

The 476-foot blast was the longest home run in the MLB this season.\n\nTrailing 7-2 at the time of that blast, it sparked a come-from-behind effort as Los Angeles prevailed 11-9 against a division rival.\n\nThe moonshot might've been aided a bit by that thin Denver air, but there's no doubt it was an absolute bomb - no matter the location.\n\nThe homer came in the top of the sixth inning with LA down by five runs. Facing Colorado lefty Austin Gomber with a 2-0 count and nobody on, Ohtani awaited his pitch and locked in when he saw the 84 MPH delivery.\n\nHe quickly turned on the off-speed pitch and sent it sailing to the deepest part of the ballpark.\n\nAfter the game, Gomber could do nothing but praise his opponent.\n\n\"I thought I pitched him well the first two at-bats... He's the best player on the planet and I just made a mistake slider down the middle. You're not gonna get those past him.\"\n\nThough he'd like to have the mistake back, Gomber pitched well enough to win. The starter exited the game with his team up 8-4 in the seventh frame.\n\nUnfortunately, the bullpen would let that victory slip away.\n\nLos Angeles loaded the bases with one out in their final at-bat before Jason Heyward blasted a pinch-hit grand slam to cut a 9-4 deficit to just a run.\n\nThe Dodgers would later get another pair on while Colorado put one more away to give Teoscar Hernandez a chance to tie or win with two outs.\n\nThe Rockies believed they'd secured the final out of the ball game when Hernandez unsuccessfully attempted to check his swing. Umpires ruled that he didn't cross the plane, but replay showed that he did!\n\nHaving new life, the slugger belted a three-run homer on the very next pitch to give his team the lead.\n\nThe Colorado bench exploded after the bomb, claiming they'd been stripped of a win. Los Angeles would record the final three outs in the bottom of the ninth to escape with a two-run victory.\n\nWere the Rockies robbed? There's certainly a case to be made!\n\nStill, the bullpen deserves some blame for the three walks and three hits allowed prior to that dagger.

They advanced the lead one to third on a ground ball to first base.\n\nThen, in a rare celebratory sequence for a team that has long resided in the National League West basement, outfielder Brenton Doyle delivered a walk-off sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Rockies piled out of the dugout. They sprayed Gatorade around the infield.\n\nThe exaltation the Dodgers experienced Tuesday, this time was on the other side.\n\nThe Dodgers had led for most of the game, despite a rocky start from right-hander Bobby Miller.\n\nMaking his first outing in more than two months because of a shoulder injury, Miller battled through a five-run, 6 \u2153-inning appearance. He gave up a three-run homer to Michael Toglia in the bottom of the first, after issuing a single and walk with two out in the inning.\n\nBut the 25-year-old bounced back from there, giving up just one run over the next five innings with the help of three double plays.\n\nThe Dodgers, meanwhile, surged ahead thanks to production from the bottom of the lineup.\n\nIn the second inning, Nos. 6-8 hitters Gavin Lux (single), Cavan Biggio (hit-by-pitch) and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (walk) loaded the bases for Shohei Ohtani, who promptly unloaded them with a three-run double. Ohtani was driven home on Freddie Freeman's RBI single in the next at-bat.\n\nWith the score tied again, 4-4, in the top of the fifth, it was another bottom-half hitter, outfielder Jason Heyward from the five-hole, who delivered a two-run double off the wall in right field, continuing his recent tear after Tuesday night's ninth-inning grand slam.\n\nIn the top of the seventh, though, Roberts tried to extend Miller -- who was only at 73 pitches -- only to watch him surrender a leadoff double to Sean Bouchard, who eventually scored what was Miller's fifth earned run of the game.\n\nAfter Miller exited, the seventh only got messier for the Dodgers. Third baseman Biggio booted a grounder with one out. No. 9 hitter Adael Amador belted a double off reliever Daniel Hudson. And Brenton Doyle tied the score at 6-6 on a one-out sacrifice fly -- what could have been the third out of the inning had Biggio not made an error.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmo_Ram\u00edrez_(right-handed_pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erasmo Ram\u00edrez (right-handed pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenton_Doyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brenton Doyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Toglia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Toglia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Lux", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Lux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan_Biggio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cavan Biggio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Hern\u00e1ndez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/388225f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4237x2383+0+582/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fce%2F37%2Fd47a311f4579a96725c0f579af31%2Fdodgers-rockies-baseball-08822.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Hernandez took a half-swing at a 1-2 fastball, but first base umpire Lance Barksdale ruled that Hernandez did not commit. Colorado manager Bud Black argued the call and was ejected.\n\nOn the next pitch, Hernandez hit his 18th home to make it 11-9. After Hernandez's ball cleared the wall, Colorado right field Jake Cave immediately took a few steps toward Barksdale and began yelling. Rockies' second baseman Alan Trejo stepped between Cave and Barksdale after the inning ended.\n\nEvan Phillips got the only batter he faced, Hunter Goodman, to recorded his 11th save in as many chances. Cave, the on-deck hitter, was restrained by bench Mike Redmond as he attempted to reach Bardsdale.\n\nElehuris Montero and Brenton Doyle homered for the Rockies, who scored four runs in the first and twice led by five runs.\n\nDoyle added three singles for his first career four-hit game, scored twice, and made a diving catch of Ohtani's line drive to right-center field with runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh inning, preserving an 8-4 lead.\n\nDodgers starter Walker Buehler gave up eight hits and seven runs in four innings. It was the first time the 29-yeaer-old right-hander allowed more than three earned runs since returning to the rotation May 6 after missing the 2023 season because of Tommy John surgery. He struck out two and walked one.\n\nMichael Petersen (1-0) worked two innings of relief and struck out two for the win.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (shoulder surgery) is scheduled to pitch three innings for Class A Rancho Cucamonga on Wednesday in his first rehab start of the season. \"He's doing fantastic,\" manager Dave Roberts said, adding that Kershaw will follow the natural progression of two or three more rehab starts \"and then we'll see where we are at.\"\n\nRockies: DH/OF Charlie Blackmon (right hamstring tightness) was removed after suffering his injury while running the bases in the first. ... LHP Kyle Freeland (elbow strain) gave up two hits and two runs and struck out four in four innings of a rehab start for Triple-A Albuquerque on Tuesday and appears close to returning. ... 2B Brendan Rodgers (hamstring) did normal pregame work Tuesday and is expected to begin a rehab assignment on Thursday with an eye toward a weekend activation. ... OF Sean Bouchard (ankle) led off and was 1 for 3 with two walks as the DH for Albuquerque.\n\nNEXT UP\n\nDodgers RHP Bobby Miller (1-1, 5.40 ERA) will oppose Rockies RHP Ryan Feltner (1-6, 5.71) in the third game of a four-game series. Miller will make his fourth start, his first since April 10, after missing nine weeks with right shoulder inflammation.

If anything, they needed the morale boost given injuries to Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Mookie Betts, and others over the weekend.\n\nWhile the offense came through in the 9-5 victory, it was the start from James Paxton that ended up almost being the most noteworthy component of the series opener in Colorado. Paxton had, of course, already bounced back from a miserable 1.2 inning, six earned run start against Pittsburgh back on June 5th. He threw six innings of one run ball against Texas last week. But Monday showed us a version of Paxton we hadn't seen in some time.\n\nThe final line for the southpaw read seven innings, a pair of hits, one walk, and just one earned run. It was his longest outing in a Dodgers uniform, but also represented his highest strikeout total. Paxton punched out eight Rockies hitters, giving him his highest strikeout figure since June of last year when he was pitching for the Red Sox.\n\nIn that regard, Monday's start was quite the deviation from the Dodgers version of James Paxton. While he's never been a truly overpowering arm, he's been even more extremely contact-oriented since joining Los Angeles. His 13.8 K% represents the lowest rate of his career, with his previous low mark coming all the way back in 2015. His success this year has, instead, come largely on his ability to limit quality contact.\n\nMonday's Paxton was all about the punchout, though. Eight strikeouts actually exceeds his total from his last three starts combined. His previous high since signing with the Dodgers was five, back on April 1st.\n\nWithin his eight strikeouts, Paxton went for a Whiff% of 29 across his three pitch types. He was particularly effective with the knuckle curve, with which he generated whiffs at a 47 percent clip. Rockies hitters were chasing at a 29 percent rate, including a 43 percent mark against the breaking pitch. For the year, Paxton had posted a chase rate of 26.2 percent & a whiff rate of just 7.4 percent prior to Monday's start.\n\nVelocity was in line with what we've seen this year (93.3 MPH average vs. 93.4 average on the year), but he had spin rates up on both the knuckle curve & changeup, according to Baseball Savant. Both the fastball & change each featured more break as a result. He simply had it all working.\n\nAt the same time, this is obviously a Rockies team prone to the K. As a team, they chase more than anybody outside of Miami and feature a strikeout rate that trails only Seattle & Boston. It's important to at least acknowledge that context within a larger theoretical hope of sustaining some rediscovered strikeout ability.\n\nNonetheless, getting a glimpse of a more vintage flavor of James Paxton bodes well as the rotation prepares for life without Yoshinobu Yamamoto.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paxton_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Paxton (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Yamamoto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckle_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knuckle curve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breaking ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/GettyImages-2158033373.jpg?itok=-By-j0Px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 577, "textEnd": 585}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 1690, "textEnd": 1699}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Watching this game and, particularly, how both offenses fared against the opposing team's starter, you got the feeling of a blowout. In the end, that wasn't quite the case, and knowing it was Colorado, things got a bit dicey late.\n\nLA seemed to be crushing anything Ty Blach threw out there, with three homers off the lefty, coincidentally the same number of hard-hit balls Gavin Stone allowed in his whole outing. However, by the time both starters' outings were finished, the Dodgers lead was only 5-2.\n\nIt seems odd to say this, but five runs felt like too little off a starter who allowed 10 hits and saw a minimum of five batters per frame across his four innings, giving up three home runs. The scoring began rather early with a Shohei Ohtani leadoff bomb, continuing a massive series for the Dodgers DH who reached multiple times in each of the four games in Coors.\n\nIn the fourth inning, after hitting roughly eighteen balls to the warning track in this series, Will Smith finally got one over the fence and Freddie Freeman made it back-to-back bombs, both hitting their 11th on the year.\n\nEarly in the broadcast, in a somewhat hyperbolic fashion, Eric Karros deemed Gavin Stone as the most consistent starter for the Dodgers in 2024. And while that might be a bit of a stretch, the young righty is certainly even building a case for the All-Star Game.\n\nFacing a challenge he had yet to encounter in his short big-league career, Stone not only survived Coors Field, but thrived in it. No Rockies' hitter came around to score while Stone was on the mound.\n\nMissing barrels was the name of the game for Stone, who had both the heater and changeup working perfectly, entering the sixth in great shape as the Dodgers led 5-0. Unfortunately, things got a bit trickier in Stone's final frame, as he left with the bases loaded after two walks in the frame. Dave Roberts called on Blake Treinen to be his fireman, and at the very least he somewhat minimized the damage, allowing a two-run single, but proceeding to strike out the hero of the previous game Brenton Doyle.\n\nEven more than the final line, you can get a good glimpse of how dominant Stone was for much of this one as he managed 16 whiffs at Coors Field, showcasing good command and swing-and-miss stuff. His seven strikeouts matched a career high.\n\nTreinen, Daniel Hudson, Alex Vesia, and Evan Philips followed Stone to wrap this one up with kudos to Vesia. The Dodgers' southpaw reliever took a blow, allowing a lefty-on-lefty bomb to the first year he faced, but went on to strike out the next three batters to finish off the eighth inning.\n\nIt'll be an unusual weekend at home as the Dodgers return to Chavez Ravine for a two-game set with the Angels, which means the rare Sunday off-day. The Dodgers haven't yet named a starting pitcher yet for Friday (7:10 p.m.; SportsNet LA, MLB Network), but Dave Roberts told reporters before Thursday's game that Landon Knack and Ryan Yarbrough are possibilities to pitch Friday, or with three off days coming in short order, a bullpen game is also possible.

Hern\u00e1ndez would have received another opportunity to potentially put his imprint on the game if not being removed early.\n\nChris Taylor replaced Hern\u00e1ndez in left field to begin the bottom of the seventh inning and lined out to second base in his only at-bat.\n\nFollowing the loss, Hern\u00e1ndez explained he was merely taken out for rest purposes, as seen on SportsNet LA:\n\n\"Everything is fine, yeah. ... Just being safe. Just to get some rest. I'm going to be in there [Thursday].\"\n\nThe Dodgers only held a 6-4 lead at the time Hern\u00e1ndez was removed from the game, which occurred after he grounded out to end the top of the seventh. Despite the close score and ultimate loss, Hern\u00e1ndez said he was not surprised by Dodgers manager Dave Roberts taking him out:\n\n\"No, because he has done it before. It's nothing new. Nothing to think about. He's done it before. It was one of those situations where he wanted to get C.T. an at-bat. He always does it when he's going to play him tomorrow. It's nothing serious.\"\n\nHern\u00e1ndez did acknowledge playing at Coors Field for the first time in his career has proven somewhat challenging because of the high altitude:\n\n\"It's a little hard.

Four days in Colorado is a lot. I think you can talk about the altitude and try to do everything you can, but the first day here was a hot game and the game today was very hot too.

Then, after we made the last out, as I was running in (to the dugout), Lance looks me right in the face and said, 'Cave, it's not even close.'\n\n\"That's when I really got (ticked off) because, it was like, 'Are you really that out of tune with the game that you can tell me that it's not even close?' Everybody in the world can see that it was at least close. And (Hernandez) did swing.\n\n\"That's one of the best teams in baseball, and we are beating them, and our pitchers are out there grinding. ... That game's won. On a swing and miss, that game's won, and we beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.\"\n\nBlack said he \"was fine\" with Cave's emotional outburst on the field.\n\n\"Every player has to be himself,\" Black said. \"Jake plays with a lot of passion and there is a high level of caring, even for the short time he's been a Rockie.

A lot of us have been on teams that have lost people to injuries, but we've got a good group to hold it down. Let them get healthy, and we'll welcome him back here sooner rather than later.\"\n\nFreeman batted six times on Monday and reached base all six times. That included walking five times to tie a Dodgers record. All those walks came in his first five trips to the plate, the last one an intentional free pass after Shohei Ohtani advanced to third base with only one out and a 2-0 count on Freeman.\n\nThe Dodgers scored twice in the ninth inning, which allowed Freeman to bat a sixth time. He took two balls in this final trip to the plate, but his sixth walk never came. Instead, Freeman singled. He scored twice on the night, giving him a box score batting line of 1 2 1 0 5, with the latter number his walk total.\n\nOnly one other player in major league history, at least dating back to 1901, had a game with that exact batting line. It was Carl Yastrzemski, on May 25, 1971 for the Red Sox against the Senators, but his final walk came in the 11th inning. Freeman is the only player ever with a 1 2 1 0 5 line in a nine-inning game.\n\nGreg Brock on May 17, 1983 at Montreal: This game needed 15 innings to decide, with the Expos winning against Steve Howe. Brock was 0-for-2, and only two of his walks came in the first nine innings. He walked again in the 11th inning, then was intentionally walked in the 13th and 15th innings, both times with a runner in scoring position.\n\nMax Muncy on April 25, 2021 vs. Padres: This was the same night as the Oscars, which was only a few miles away at Union Station, in a game during which the Dodgers bullpen gave away a 7-1 lead. Muncy's fifth walk was intentional, in the 10th inning.\n\nThat leaves two other Dodgers to walk five times in a game that lasted a regular nine innings.\n\nGene Hermanski on September 22, 1949 at the Cardinals: The Brooklyn left fielder had a busy night. He singled home the Dodgers' first two runs of the night in what was a 19-6 rout in St. Louis. The second of his walks, in the fourth inning, came with the bases loaded, giving Hermanski a three-RBI game. Hermanski's fifth-inning was intentional, with first base open and two outs in what at the time was an 8-1 game. The problem was Gil Hodges batted next, and he singled home two runs.\n\nDusty Baker on September 28, 1980 at the Padres: Baker is the only Dodger with five unintentional walks in a game. He did so in a pennant race in San Diego, with the Dodgers vying to catch Houston in the season's final week. LA lost this game, but Baker did his best, reaching base in all five trips to the plate. He never batted with anyone on base all day.\n\nFreeman's single and five walks on Monday in Colorado continued his red-hot June. He's reached base in all 15 games this month, with at least one hit in 14 of those games. Freeman in June is hitting .373/.500/.725 with four home runs, four doubles, a triple, 10 RBI, and 15 runs scored.\n\nWith 46 walks through the Dodgers' first 74 games, Freeman is on pace for 100 walks on the season. His career high is 90 walks, in 2014 with Atlanta. Freeman has also walked 80 or more four other times, including 84 walks in 2022 with the Dodgers.", "source": {"uri": "truebluela.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "True Blue LA"}, "authors":

The game looked out of reach for the Dodgers, but great at-bats, solid contact, and some luck involved got the Dodgers over the top.\n\nThe guys scratched and clawed, but the hero of the game was Dodgers outfielder and likely All-Star Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez. Hern\u00e1ndez came up clutch for the Dodgers, which isn't new or a surprise if you're familiar with his brief tenure in Dodger blue.\n\nWith two on, two outs in the ninth inning, and down by one run, Hern\u00e1ndez hit a three-run blast to give L.A. the lead and ultimately the win. After the game, manager Dave Roberts spoke to the media, including Jack Harris of the Los Angeles Times, and compared Hern\u00e1ndez to a fan favorite and slugger, Manny Ramirez.\n\n\"He reminds me of Manny Ramirez. When guys are on base, that's when he really starts to lock it in and focus. He hunts those RBIs. That's how you win baseball games.\"\n\nRamirez, especially with the Dodgers, always came through when it mattered most. Ramirez had 53 RBIs in 53 games after being traded to the Dodgers midway through the 2008 season. Hern\u00e1ndez leads the Dodgers with 54 RBIs -- a 117-RBI pace for the season.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez's home run didn't come without controversy, though. On a 2-and-2 count, he was almost called for a game-ending check swing. Luckily, the first base umpire, Lance Barksdale, ruled the pitch a ball, keeping the at-bat alive. On the very next pitch, Hern\u00e1ndez took advantage of the opportunity and crushed one deep to right-center field.\n\n\"It was close. Now that I saw the replay, I don't think so. But you could've called it either way, and I think it would've been fine.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez, like Ramirez, brings a tenacity to the baseball field that L.A. has lacked for some time. It's a kid's game, and Hern\u00e1ndez does his best to show emotion and get his teammates hyped when needed. Tuesday's match was just that.\n\nPhoto Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHave you subscribed to our YouTube channel?

Manager Dave Roberts compared Hern\u00e1ndez to former Dodgers slugger Manny Ramirez, known for his clutch performances.\n\nRamirez was always reliable in crucial moments, much like Hern\u00e1ndez has been for the Dodgers this season. Hern\u00e1ndez currently leads the team with 54 RBIs, showing his ability to drive in runs and make a difference in games. His home run in this game was a game-changer, but it did come with a bit of controversy.\n\nThere was a close call on a 2-2 count where Hern\u00e1ndez almost had a game-ending check swing called against him. Fortunately, the umpire ruled it a ball, giving Hern\u00e1ndez another chance. He took advantage of it and hit the next pitch for a deep home run.

If he's excited or anxious about it, he's keeping it to himself. More than likely, he just wants to get it over with.\n\nTake it from Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who recalled that's the way he felt whenever he went against a former club during his lengthy playing career.\n\n\"I think he's worried about today and once tomorrow comes, tomorrow comes,\" Roberts said Thursday ahead of the Dodgers series finale at Colorado. \"I think that he is grateful for his time in Anaheim, grateful for the fans. And I think he just wants to help the Dodgers win, but I think he wants to get it over with.\"\n\nThe Dodgers return home Friday to begin a two-game series against the Angels, where Ohtani emerged as a pitching and hitting superstar in six years with the team. He joined the Dodgers in the offseason, agreeing to a $700 million free-agent contract, though he won't pitch this season while continuing to recover from an injured elbow ligament.\n\nOhtani acknowledged \"looking forward\" to playing them and added that he still follows the Angels \"here and there\" to keep up with what he called the regular news.\n\nSpeaking through an interpreter following Wednesday night's game, Ohtani also said the vibe surrounding his upcoming appearance against the Angels doesn't feel all that different from any other game he's played or will play with his new team because it is not in Anaheim.\n\n\"I believe more so when I go to Anaheim (it will be emotional for him),\" Ohtani said. \"But since we're playing at Dodgers Stadium, I'm just going to be focused on playing the game.\"\n\nThe Dodgers have not yet announced a starter for Friday night's game against the Angels. Roberts said the team is still weighing its options in coming up with a replacement for injured Yoshinobu Yamamoto.\n\n\"We are either going to do a bullpen game or do a spot start,\" Roberts said. \"I don't know if there's going to be somebody from Triple A.\"\n\nIf they do opt to bring up a starter from the minors, Landan Knack is a possibility. He is 3-2 with a 3.54 ERA for Triple A Oklahoma City. Knack made four starts for the Dodgers early in the season, going 1-1 with a 2.61 ERA.\n\nRookie center fielder Andy Pages has become a fixture in the Dodgers lineup in relatively short order.\n\nPages made his major league debut April 16 against Washington after being called up from Triple A Oklahoma City to fill in for Jason Heyward, who missed time with a back problem.\n\nHeading into Thursday's game at Colorado, Pages was hitting .266, scoring 35 runs on 55 hits, including eight home runs and he has played exceptional defense.\n\nRoberts said he was surprised how quickly Pages has made adjustments.\n\n\"Yes. Pleasantly surprised, because it is not easy. He's a very smart player. He lives and breathes baseball. He's got a high baseball IQ. He's not afraid to work. And he doesn't run from big spots, where certain players do. He fought, he fought when he was scuffling (earlier). He continued to work, remained confident, fought in the batter's box and competed. He's got to the other side, so that shows me a lot,\" said Roberts.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dennis_georgatos@ocregister.com", "name": "Dennis Georgatos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Yamamoto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24172030072643-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-16", "textStart": 2343, "textEnd": 2351}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

They led 6-4 and looked to be in control of the game, ready to put themselves in a position for a four-game sweep Thursday afternoon. Then the wheels came off and Colorado exited the game with a 7-6 walkoff victory.\n\nThe good news for Los Angeles is the betting odds say they're heavily favored to get out of Colorado with a series win. Here's what the odds look like on BetMGM with Gavin Stone on the mound for LA against Ty Blach for the Rockies:\n\nA 2.5-run run line is kind of wild, especially when Blach has actually managed a very respectable 3.76 ERA in eight appearances (six starts) at home. It's a little less wild when Stone is starting on the other side though.\n\nThe Dodgers' 25-year-old starter has a 3.01 ERA this season and he shutout the Rockies in 5.0 innings when he faced them at Dodger Stadium on June 2. LA's offense has been rolling at Coors Field and with Stone pitching as well as he has this season they should be able to grab a series win relatively comfortably, even if Blach pitches well.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Blach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Blach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Shakin'_Sorry", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Shakin' Sorry", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/GettyImages-2158358960.jpg?itok=B5_xZu4Q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659008", "eventUri": "eng-9659008", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 887, "textEnd": 893}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

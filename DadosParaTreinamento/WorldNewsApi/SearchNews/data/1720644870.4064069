It is kind of a win-win for Trump because, on the one hand, he is saying bluntly this campaign is about me and my ego, right? 'I want power. People have done bad things to me,' he is using that to fuel the emotion of his supporters because his whole campaign, that is all it is, hate and rage and fear and that is what he keeps drumming up.\"Watch below or at the link.

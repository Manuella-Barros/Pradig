In an exclusive conversation with PEOPLE at the recent 2024 Tony Awards Meet the Nominees junket, the star \u2014 who earned a Tony Award nomination for best actor in a play for his role as Dr. Thomas Stockmann in An Enemy of the People \u2014 addressed the possibility of HBO reviving the acclaimed show, which had its series finale in May 2023. \u201cI'm sure there's a desire for more [Succession],\u201d Strong, 45, tells PEOPLE. \u201cI would really pass that buck to [creator] Jesse Armstrong.\" \"But I think in terms of the role that I played, he came to his terminal point,\" he adds. \"So for me, that\u2019s something that is very happily put to rest.\u201d For his Succession role as power-hungry Kendall \u2014 the son of patriarch Logan Roy, who competed with his siblings to take control over the family\u2019s media conglomerate \u2014 Strong won an Emmy Award for outstanding actor in a drama series in 2020. During his acceptance speech, Strong reflected on playing Kendall. \u201cI read a poem by [American poet] Stephen Dunn that said, \u2018All I ever wanted was a book so good I\u2019ll be finishing it for the rest of my life,\u2019 \u201d he said at the time. \u201cThis job was that, for me.\" In the show's series finale, Kendall found out that he would not become the new CEO of Waystar Royco. \u201cI feel like if I don\u2019t get to do this, I might \u2014 I might \u2014 die,\u201d Kendall exclaimed before learning who would take over the role. \u201cI\u2019m the eldest boy! I\u2019m the eldest boy!\u201d Following Succession's end, Strong has starred in the Broadway production of An Enemy of the People, an adaptation of the 1882 play of the same name. Strong says this version, written by Amy Herzog and directed by Sam Gold, isn\u2019t a \u201cstuffy period play from the 19th century\u201d because they\u2019ve \u201crepurposed it for a modern audience\u201d starring himself, Michael Imperioli and Victoria Pedretti.

He becomes a whistleblower after the mayor doesn\u2019t want the town to find out about the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s about a man who\u2019s trying to wake up his community to an imminent ecological catastrophe,\u201d Strong explains. \u201cBut in general, about someone who\u2019s trying to wake people up to facing what\u2019s happening and all the ways that people avoid that and deny the truth.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s a play that it\u2019s a privilege to get to give it to audiences,\u201d Strong adds. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been very meaningful to me.\u201d The 2024 Tony Awards will take place on Sunday, June 16, at Lincoln Center's David H. Koch Theater in New York City. Viewers can watch the show on CBS and Paramount+ beginning at 8 p.m. EST. Select awards will also be handed out on a preshow that will stream on Pluto TV.

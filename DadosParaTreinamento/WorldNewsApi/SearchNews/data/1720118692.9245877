Deccan Chronicle sat down with Ajit Garcha, the General Manager of The Park Hotel to share his insights on the hotel's commitment to promoting regional cuisines. He said, \u201cWe are proud to celebrate Telangana Formation Day with our special Bangaru Bhojanam brunch. He added, \u201cThis is our way of honouring the rich culinary heritage of Telangana. We have a Telugu chef on board, and his expertise in local cuisine made this event even more special. The Secretary and Commissioner of Tourism were also pleasantly surprised by the authenticity and variety of dishes prepared by Chef Satya Pandari.\"Garcha spoke at length about how the hotel was going to great lengths to promote regional food and micro-cuisines from different parts of the country. \u201cIn the past year, we have made a conscious effort to spotlight various regional cuisines. We have hosted food festivals featuring Bastar, Naga, and Ladakhi cuisines.\u201dEmphasising the significance of authentic recipes and local ingredients, Garcha said, \u201cOur in-house chefs crafted this menu with great care and attention to detail. It\u2019s a completely in-house effort, showcasing the best of Telugu cuisine.\"The brunch, which was exclusively a one day event, saw an overwhelming response from guests. While lauding the success, Garcha elaborated on the future plans for the hotel. \u201cWe have an average of 80 to 100 covers every Sunday for brunch. Considering the summer heat, this turnout is quite impressive. We plan to extend our brunches to Saturdays as well, making them a weekend specialty,\u201d he says.Talking about what sets The Park Hyderabad apart from the other hotels in the city, the GM emphasises on the extensive brunch spread. \u201cOur brunch is unique because of its extensive live counters and the freshness we bring to the menu every week. Last week, we had an American theme with grills and burgers. Before that, during mango season, we featured mango-centric dishes. Each week, we introduce something new while retaining our core offerings like biryani, grilled fish, and live Asian counters,\" says Garcha.Reflecting on the local palates, Garcha observed, \"Hyderabadis are gradually opening up to new culinary experiences, but traditional favorites like biryani and spicy, fried foods remain popular. For example, when we hosted the Bastar food festival, critics appreciated the freshness and uniqueness, but the general response was lukewarm. Similarly, the Naga food festival was a mix of hits and misses.\"Besides these exclusive culinary pop-ups, The Park Hyderabad\u2019s offerings are diversified with events like theatre performances, vintage car rallies and art fairs. \u201cWe hosted the Artix hotel art fair and a vintage car rally earlier this year. We are also planning a theater event with Mala Pasha's Torn Curtains soon. These initiatives have helped us reconnect with our guests and bring a new vibrancy to the hotel,\" asserts Garcha.Talking about keeping the hotel guest-ready, he reveals that the property has undergone refurbishments. \"We have changed the carpets, updated room fittings, and improved illumination in both rooms and corridors. Entertainment has become a core part of our offerings, with live music and events creating a lively atmosphere,\" he says.Ajit Garcha's vision for the hotel is clear: \u201cWe aim to offer the largest and tastiest brunch in the city, providing a unique and enjoyable dining experience for our guests.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/general/from-telangana-delicacies-to-art-fairs-the-park-hyderabads-vibrant-offerings-896977", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/02/1094274-img-20240602-wa0053.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:19:01", "author": "Reshmi AR", "authors": ["Reshmi AR"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.87}

The cast's wild parties provided the perfect backdrop for the drama that came with the plot of the E4 show, which began all the way back in 2011. Chelsea's elite lived a life of decadence in some of the capital's most exclusive postcodes as the cast appeared to spend all their time at evening events, liquid lunches and even champagne breakfasts. Original cast member Spencer Matthews has admitted he used to drink 'five to ten pints' every single day in his early years on the show and had a 'serious alcohol problem'. The original cast of Made In Chelsea back in 2011 when the programme launched But more than a decade on from when it first aired, many of Chelsea's most iconic faces seem to have changed their ways entirely and left their partying days behind as they make their own way in the world (with a leg up from their family fortunes, of course). Worlds away from their booze-drenched antics that made them famous, many have chosen to follow a path of wellness and health since leaving the show and now choose crystals over cocktails, promote veganism and have traded the bright lights of the King's Road for countryside fresh air. Here FEMAIL takes a look at the MIC stars whose lives are now unrecognisable from their time onscreen... Alex Mytton Made In Chelsea's iconic 'bad boy' Alex Mytton - only referred to as 'Mytton' on the show - embodied the show's party culture Ten years later and now 30, Alex Mytton seems to have undergone a major transformation Made In Chelsea's iconic 'bad boy' Alex Mytton - only referred to as 'Mytton' on the show - embodied the show's party culture. Alex joined MIC back in 2013 during the show's fifth season and dated several cast members including Nicola Hughes and Binky Felstead. Mytton cheated on his girlfriend Binky numerous times, but things came to an end for good when he admitted he'd taken part in an 'orgy' and she slapped him round the face. He also dated Lottie Moss - the half-sister of supermodel Kate - for nine months in 2017 when she was 18 and he was 24. Ten years later and now 30, Alex Mytton seems to have undergone a major transformation and has set up a 'wellness retreat' in Ibiza. Mytton has set up a series of wellness retreats in Ibiza and is even speaking at a wellness festival He joined MIC back in 2013 during the show's fifth season and dated several cast members including Nicola Hughes and Binky Felstead His recent excursion last month offered yoga, meditation, 'breathwork and cold therapy', ice baths, nature immersion, a candlelit banquet, a cacao ceremony and 'manifestation work'. He added that the Spanish party island has 'nurtured' his 'journey of discovery, growth and healing'. Mytton is even set to be a speaker at wellness festival 'Wellnergy'. But fans are not yet willing to let go of his old party-going ways, as one couldn't resist quipping in a comment on his Instagram post: 'Where's the sesh?' Jess Woodley Jess Woodley was romantically linked to Andy Jordan, Alex Mytton and Jamie Laing on the show (pictured together) Jess posted pictures of herself on a yoga retreat in Indonesia (above), and before that embarked on a ten-day silent meditation Jess Woodley wasn't on the show for long but was still part of the series in its heyday and even appeared in the LA spin-off. During her MIC days she was romantically linked to Andy Jordan, Alex Mytton and Jamie Laing but left the show in 2017. Jess has since spoken out about the show in a now-deleted Instagram post, writing: 'A little personal note to anyone on here who may be following me from when I was on a reality TV show. 'I just want to express how dangerous the nature of mainstream reality TV is. The affects it can have on human being, to me it felt like I made a decision at a very young age resulting in what feels like identity theft. 'We all made mistakes in life this feels like mine if you are following me for the wrong reasons and support reality TV please unfollow me.' Jess has also been one to embrace a spiritual lifestyle and, alongside her new passion for making furniture, has enjoyed a variety of retreats. Jess's social media feeds seem to embody her spiritual awakening, from posting nude photos captioned 'the weight of the world is love' to posing in a tree In April last year she posted pictures of herself on a yoga retreat in Indonesia, and before that embarked on a ten-day silent meditation. She said: 'This is the the last day of Vipassan\u00e3 / Teaching sila samadhi pa\u00f1\u00f1a / Truth of our ever changing reality. 'If I could have anything in the world right now it would be that everyone I know experiences a Vipassan\u00e3.' Jess's social media feeds seem to embody her spiritual awakening, from posting nude photos captioned 'the weight of the world is love' to posing in a tree. Caggie Dunlop Caggie Dunlop was the OG Made In Chelsea IT Girl in 2011 when the show began Caggie now hosts her own astrological podcast - Saturn Returns - and has written a book with the same name Caggie's Instagram feed is the picture of health and wellness: she doesn't drink alcohol or coffee Caggie Dunlop was the OG Made In Chelsea IT girl, and her will they/won't they romance with Spencer Matthews formed the focus of the early seasons. But since leaving the show in 2015, her priorities are very different. Caggie now hosts her own astrological podcast - Saturn Returns - and has written a book with the same name. 'Saturn Returns' is said to be a key astrological marker in one's life between the ages of 27 and 31 and is a time of renewal. She says her own 'Saturn Return' happened in 2017, telling Grazia: 'I was in LA and someone told me I was about to go through my Saturn return. 'I delved into astrology and spiritual practices and really leaned into that side of things.' She says a Saturn Return occurs when the planets returns to the same place it was in when a person was born, as it takes just under 30 years to orbit the earth. During Caggie's Return, she decided to give up alcohol, which initially meant she found it difficult at social gatherings - but has now found more balance. Caggie doesn't even drink coffee these days, instead choosing to start her day with a tea. She now lives back in London, but spent two years in LA when she was 27. She told Hello! Magazine the time 'definitely opened me up to a different sort of language, different practices, different people, different teachers\u2026 'But I guess that aspect of myself, I kind of hid away because it was seen sort of wacky and woo woo.' Millie Mackintosh Millie was known for her dramatic scenes in Made In Chelsea, including during her relationship with Hugo Taylor Millie has given up alcohol and in November explained that she has been 'hugging trees' to help reduce her anxiety Millie Mackintosh featured in one of Chelsea's most dramatic scenes ever - in which she publicly shamed her best friend Rosie Fortescue for sleeping with her then-boyfriend Hugo Taylor. But in a huge twist of events, after a failed marriage to rapper Professor Green, Millie went on to wed Taylor - and the couple now share two children. Though she may post less about wellness and astrology than some of her co-stars, Millie still pursues a more toned-down lifestyle than her partying days. Millie has also given up alcohol and in November explained that she has been 'hugging trees' to help reduce her anxiety. Millie shared her top tricks that she has implemented into her wellness routine to help reduce her anxiety. She crazed that wearing blue light glasses, hugging trees, drinking nettle teas, having magnesium salt baths along with hot and cold therapy does the trick. She wrote: 'Here's some easy tweaks that you can try at home. 'Blue Light Glasses - Wear for three hours before bed and get on with your evening. Blocking blue light regulates sleep & improves overall well-being. You can find on Amazon for \u00a35 \u2013 if interested I can link some options. 'Forest Bathing. Yup we're about to get 'hippy-dippy'! The idea of hugging trees might seem strange, but it's scientifically proven to reduce stress, boost immunity & trigger release of oxytocin? So, if you see hugging a tree in the park, you know why. Millie decided to become sober two months after her 33rd birthday after realising her 'anxiety levels were really high' 'Drink Nettle Tea! Helps detoxify the body, reduces inflammation + other benefits. You can find in supermarkets from \u00a33.50. 'Hot & Cold Therapy. Great for your mind & body.

Millie is married to former co-star, Hugo Taylor, and the couple shares daughters Sienna Grace, three, and Aurelia Violet, two, together. Millie is now married to her former MIC co-star, Hugo Taylor Millie recently posted a series of photos of herself taken around the time of her life-changing decision to go alcohol-free to her 1.3 million followers. The Quality Street heiress accompanied the images with a lengthy description, where she shared the highlights of her sobriety journey. She began: 'Ditching alcohol has without a doubt been the best thing I've done for myself, my mental health and my general well-being. 'Becoming alcohol-free has really started me on a journey of self-discovery, I've learnt so much about myself, my strengths, and weaknesses. 'This self-awareness has been invaluable and I'm more focused on building a life I love.' Millie decided to become sober two months after her 33rd birthday after realising her 'anxiety levels were really high'. Spencer Matthews Spencer's Made In Chelsea days were notorious for booze-fuelled partying and relationship drama Spencer has also undergone an impressive body transformation since his drinking days Spencer's Made In Chelsea days were notorious for booze-fuelled partying and relationship drama, dating the likes of Louise Thompson and Lucy Watson. Spencer, who is now married to TV presenter Vogue Williams, said he was 'lazy' back then and suffering from 'a serious drinking problem' as his starring role on the popular series had caused him to become arrogant. Spencer worked as a city trader before joining the cast of Channel 4's Made In Chelsea, and says that 'alcohol was just readily available' at investment lunches and dinners. At its peak, he would be having five to 10 pints a day. But in 2018 Spencer quit drinking for good to save his marriage with Vogue and for the sake of his children. He has since founded his business, clean liquor company CleanCo, which sells low alcohol drinks. Spencer has also undergone an impressive body transformation since his drinking days, showcasing his newfound muscles in several Instagram posts. Speaking on The Mail's Everything I Know About Me podcast, Spencer admitted of his past behaviour: 'There was a certainty that I would lose Vogue, if I carried on drinking the way I was drinking.' He recalled how in the early months of their romance, after meeting on 2017 reality show The Jump, he and Vogue would go out partying together, admitting 'we had this highly social, quite boozy relationship.' Spencer was drinking five to 10 pints a day in his early days on Chelsea (pictured in season one) In 2018 Spencer quit drinking for good to save his marriage with Vogue Williams and for the sake of his children Alcohol even brought the couple, now parents of three, together as he admits he was perhaps his most dependent on booze around the time they met. 'I think anybody who was on The Jump will tell you that it was quite something,' he explained. 'Although I went sober when I made the finals for ten days before the finals, only went and won!' 'When I won I went on some like mental bender, lost everything. I was beginning to feel like I was a real mess, then. And that was a bit unusual for me.' Spencer explained though that while Vogue would 'binge drink every few days and drink to get drunk' he would carry on 'and it was every day.' 'She won't mind me saying she's a bit of a binge drinker. She actually hates alcohol, she can't stand being hungover. She doesn't like the taste of booze, but she'll drink to get drunk. Back then she would drink to get drunk every few days. Now, it's once a month type of thing,' Spencer explained. 'On the days off, I would drink and she wouldn't. And then she would get back on the horse. And then when she stopped, I carried on and it was every day, and she would draw attention to it.' Around this time, Vogue fell pregnant with their eldest son Theodore. 'My drinking was emphasised by the fact that she wasn't drinking,' Spencer said.

However in March she announced she would be stepping back from the series after an eight-year stint.

But Mimi too has left the days of drama behind her, and is engaged to her ex-MIC co-star Ben Darby, who she introduced as her boyfriend on the show in 2018. In a recent YouTube interview with John Miles, Mimi said she began drinking and doing drugs when she was just 12 years old. She said: 'I just decided that I physically felt crap and mentally felt crap and I just decided it's time to change. 'This journey is more about unbecoming what you're not than becoming something you've never been.'

And speaking on the TSC podcast about the power of manifestation she said: 'I don't know what it is. All I know is that it works for me. 'When I embody the energy of my future, things in my life start to change.

The SPOs who were regularized include Amit Sharma, Karanveer Singh, Sumeet Verma, Anil Choudhary, Sham Lal, Pankaj Sharma, Mukesh Rajput, Lovepreet Jatt, and Sahil Singh. \u201cThe SPOs were regularized for the good work they did. We have an SPO component in the police that must be taken care of separately and in a fast-forward mode. We went out of the usual procedure to regularize them on a fast track to reward them,\u201d DGP Swain told reporters. He emphasized that when the resolve is strong, people come together. \u201cThe SPOs are performing well. We have an SOP to bring everyone together, whether SPO or otherwise, through conversion or felicitation,\u201d he said. The DGP also appreciated the role of other police officers and said that medals and awards for other constables or officers would be proposed separately. He said that the senior leadership of the police has decided to strengthen village defence groups in Kathua and other areas. \u201cSPOs will also be strengthened,\u201d he added. DGP reminisced about his tenure as Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of Kathua district and praised the locals for their patriotism and bravery. \u201cThere is a feeling of homecoming. When I travel from here, I feel happy. My heart is filled with happiness because Kathua is a place where people are always filled with patriotism. I have served here as an SSP for two years and have seen people with a strong commitment to safeguarding their country. It is a natural behaviour among them,\u201d he said. He further recounted stories told to him by the people about the 1965 and 1971 wars and how the people of Kathua stood firm against the enemy and fully supported the armed forces. \u201cThey have performed exceptionally important roles during these periods.

Ganesh Dass, the father of SPO Sham Lal, who was regularized as a constable by the DGP, thanked the police and the DGP for the speedy steps in honouring the SPOs for their actions in eliminating terrorists and saving the village from a major tragedy. \u201cI never thought the DGP could elevate them to constables.

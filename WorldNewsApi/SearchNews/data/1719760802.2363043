Details about the event are sparse, but the father of the groom \u2014 Jon Bon Jovi \u2014 recently appeared on BBC\u2019s The One Show to share some insight from the private event. \u201cThey\u2019re great,\u201d Bon Jovi said of the newlyweds. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely fantastic. It was a very small family wedding, and the bride looked gorgeous, and Jake is happy as can be. It\u2019s true.\u201d The 20-year-old actress got engaged to Bongiovi, 22, in April 2023. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you three summers now, honey, I want \u2019em all,\u201d Brown wrote on Instagram while revealing the news, soundtracked by Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLover.\u201d In his own post, Bongiovi kept it short and sweet, captioning photos from the proposal with: \u201cForever.\u201d Earlier this year, Brown recalled the moment her now-husband popped the question during an early morning diving session. \u201cWe go under, and we\u2019re like many meters down. He gives me a shell, and I turn it over, and it\u2019s a ring,\u201d she said during an appearance on The Tonight Show, adding: \u201cHe puts the ring on my hand, and as I go to show him, the ring falls off my finger, plummets so fast,\u201d the Damsel star recalled. \u201cJake threw himself into the water, like, so deep. Like, the diver was like, \u2018You can\u2019t do that. Your ears\u2014literally, your brain will explode.\u2019\u201d She continued: \u201cI truly feel like it\u2019s a reflection of who he is, and I feel like we\u2019re always going to have each other\u2019s back, and if anyone drops the ball, we got it.\u201d Brown and Bongiovi initially met on Instagram and began dating in 2021. \u201cI don\u2019t know if age matters, if you find the right partner and you grow together,\u201d Bon Jovi told SiriusXM\u2019s Andy Cohen Live last year about the young couple. \u201cI think that would be my advice really, is growing together is wise.\u201d He added: \u201cI think that all of my kids have found the people that they think they can grow together with. And we like \u2019em all.\u201d", "summary": "The father of the groom shared insight into the private wedding ceremony, saying, \"The bride looked gorgeous, and Jake is happy as can be\"", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/millie-bobby-brown-jake-bongiovi-married-1235029235/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/millie-bobby-brown-wedding.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:05:06", "author": "Larisha Paul", "authors": ["Larisha Paul"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.024}

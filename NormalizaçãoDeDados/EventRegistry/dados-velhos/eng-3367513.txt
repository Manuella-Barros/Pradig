Jackson, left, and Ryan Reynolds in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard.\" (Jack English/Lionsgate via AP)\n\nThere's not a whole lot that's new about \"The Hitman's Bodyguard .\" Its mismatched-pals premise is the stuff of classic buddy comedies. Stars Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson play their typical character types: Reynolds the handsome do-gooder; Jackson the unflappable badass whose favorite word is mother(expletive). And like many movie heroes past, they're tasked with taking down a brutal dictator.\n\nYet that kind of familiar framework is what makes this action-packed mashup of gun battles, car chases, fist fights and international intrigue such a delight: Leave reality's chaos at the door, and lose yourself in a world where the bad guys get what's coming to them and Sam Jackson spontaneously breaks into song. (He actually sings three times in this film -- once in Italian! With nuns! Plus his own, original F-word-laden tune.)\n\nAnd did I mention there's a love-story subplot?\n\nReynolds plays Michael Bryce, a well-manicured, tightly wound, type-A personality who works in \"executive protection,\" providing high-end, high-stakes bodyguard services for society's unsavories. His career and polished image take a nosedive after a weapons dealer he was protecting is killed by a sniper. Bryce blames his Interpol detective ex-girlfriend, Amelia (Elodie Yung), for the deadly mistake, believing she leaked information to her law-enforcement colleagues.\n\nA couple years later, Amelia is tapped to transport notorious hit-man Darius Kincaid (Jackson) to International Criminal Court, where he's to be the sole witness testifying against murderous Belarusian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman, always perfect). Dukhovich deploys his bottomless army of goons to take out their convoy and ultimately eliminate Kincaid, who promised his testimony in exchange for the release of his wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek), from jail.\n\nOutgunned and desperate, Amelia turns to Bryce for help, promising to help restore his career if he can get Kincaid to The Hague safely. Thus begins the odd-couple pairing of Reynolds and Jackson and premise for various physical and verbal throw-downs, with the bad guys and each other.\n\nWhen Bryce says he's there to keep Kincaid out of harm's way, Kincaid replies, \"I am harm's way.\"\n\nAnd he proves it, taking out baddies even while handcuffed and outracing a fleet of armored cars while whipping a speedboat through Amsterdam's canals. Jackson soars in roles like these, and his performance is as bulletproof as Kincaid is rumored to be. The 68-year-old is as thrilling an action star as any decades younger. It wouldn't be surprising to learn he does his own stunts, and insisted on manning that speedboat himself.\n\nJackson's Kincaid is also the story's wise elder, giving Bryce romance advice as they dodge Dukhovich's thugs.\n\nReynolds works his comic and superhero action chops and Hayek is at her fieriest as a barmaid unafraid to cut a guy's carotid with a broken bottle.\n\nDirector Patrick Hughes (\"The Expendables 3\") keeps the action grounded in the story's narrative without compromising the excitement. The movie is loud, with several explosions that could shake a nervous viewer from her seat, but the chases are epic, especially the speedboat scene, during which Reynolds' character kept pace on a motorcycle.\n\nScreenwriter Tom O'Connor mitigates the serious matter in his story -- the trial of a tyrant for war crimes against his own people -- with brisk banter and thrilling fight sequences, along with a touch of sweetness as it becomes clear that both Bryce and Kincaid are motivated by love.\n\nIf only movies could make that universal.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" a Lionsgate release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong violence and language throughout.\" Running time: 118 minutes.

Jackson, left, and Ryan Reynolds in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard.\" (Jack English/Lionsgate via AP)\n\nReynolds plays Michael Bryce, a well-manicured, tightly wound, type-A personality who works in \"executive protection,\" providing high-end, high-stakes bodyguard services for society's unsavories. His career and polished image take a nosedive after a weapons dealer he was protecting is killed by a sniper. Bryce blames his Interpol detective ex-girlfriend, Amelia (Elodie Yung), for the deadly mistake, believing she leaked information to her law-enforcement colleagues.\n\nA couple years later, Amelia is tapped to transport notorious hit-man Darius Kincaid (Jackson) to International Criminal Court, where he's to be the sole witness testifying against murderous Belarusian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman, always perfect). Dukhovich deploys his bottomless army of goons to take out their convoy and ultimately eliminate Kincaid, who promised his testimony in exchange for the release of his wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek), from jail.\n\nOutgunned and desperate, Amelia turns to Bryce for help, promising to help restore his career if he can get Kincaid to The Hague safely. Thus begins the odd-couple pairing of Reynolds and Jackson and premise for various physical and verbal throw-downs, with the bad guys and each other.\n\nWhen Bryce says he's there to keep Kincaid out of harm's way, Kincaid replies, \"I am harm's way.\"\n\nAnd he proves it, taking out baddies even while handcuffed and outracing a fleet of armored cars while whipping a speedboat through Amsterdam's canals. Jackson soars in roles like these, and his performance is as bulletproof as Kincaid is rumored to be. The 68-year-old is as thrilling an action star as any decades younger. It wouldn't be surprising to learn he does his own stunts, and insisted on manning that speedboat himself.\n\nJackson's Kincaid is also the story's wise elder, giving Bryce romance advice as they dodge Dukhovich's thugs.\n\nReynolds works his comic and superhero action chops and Hayek is at her fieriest as a barmaid unafraid to cut a guy's carotid with a broken bottle.\n\nDirector Patrick Hughes (\"The Expendables 3\") keeps the action grounded in the story's narrative without compromising the excitement. The movie is loud, with several explosions that could shake a nervous viewer from her seat, but the chases are epic, especially the speedboat scene, during which Reynolds' character kept pace on a motorcycle.\n\nScreenwriter Tom O'Connor mitigates the serious matter in his story - the trial of a tyrant for war crimes against his own people - with brisk banter and thrilling fight sequences, along with a touch of sweetness as it becomes clear that both Bryce and Kincaid are motivated by love.\n\nIf only movies could make that universal.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" a Lionsgate release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong violence and language throughout.\" Running time: 118 minutes. Three stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA definition of R: Restricted.

Recycling vintage character types, tropes and even politics, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" already feels like you're half-watching it on TNT on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nDirected by \"The Expendables 3\" director Patrick Hughes, the script by Tom O'Connor could have been written in 2005 and never updated, as a ripoff Tarantino that thinks swearing stands in for wit, with the kind of casual sexism and objectification of women that movies got away with before we all got sick of it.\n\nBut this is a film that lives and dies on its stars, and Samuel L. Jackson, as the hitman, and Ryan Reynolds, as the bodyguard, working within their already well-established personas, make for a fine pair of unlikely partners, and hit a few well-placed punchlines with expert delivery. Jackson, in particular, is a treat to watch, whether singing Italian folk songs with nuns, or doling out love advice via speakerphone during a car chase.\n\nThe plot concerns testimony that the hitman, Darius Kincaid (Jackson), is supposed to give against a bloodthirsty Belarussian dictator, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). In exchange for the release of his feisty wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek) from a Dutch prison (it's never explained why she's in prison, however), Kincaid promises to offer proof of Dukhovich's war crimes.\n\nWhen the Interpol transfer of Kincaid goes south, agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) calls up an old boyfriend for backup, an \"executive security agent\" who's fallen on hard times, Michael Bryce (Reynolds). Bryce and Kincaid have a long and thorny history as adversaries, so their 24-hour jaunt from England to Amsterdam proves to be quite eventful. Thanks to Dukhovich's thugs, who are trying to prevent Kincaid from testifying, it's also violently action-packed.\n\nIt's unfortunate that \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" hits U.S. theaters this particular weekend -- it's no fault of the distributor, but it's unlikely audiences will be entertained by the multiple scenes of evil henchmen plowing vehicles through quaint city squares, mowing down innocent bystanders.\n\nThe film demonstrates a hypocritical attitude about murder -- while Kincaid and Bryce race across town to indict a dictator for murdering civilians, they remorselessly leave a wake of bloody bodies in the streets. They're bad guys, but the tricky morality doesn't quite gel.\n\nMoreover, the violence of \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is thuddingly, exhaustingly dull. It's not shot in any particularly interesting way, the cinematic geography is mush, and the stunts and action choreography are nothing to write home about. As the film pushes the two-hour mark, it just becomes a boring blur.\n\nSpeaking of blur -- Hughes shoots every scene with open windows providing backlight, creating a gauzy haze throughout the whole film. It makes no sense why every scene looks like the lens has been smeared with Vaseline. It doesn't even soften the edges of the brutally bad CGI.\n\nThe problem with \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" aside from the dodgy filmmaking craft, is that this story is the least interesting tale to tell about these characters. The flashbacks, to Kincaid's first kill, and his meet-cute with Sonia, are juicy snippets of stories that would have made for a better movie. This film should have traded the hitman's bodyguard for his wife -- she's the most compelling character in it.\n\nCast: Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L.

It stars Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, but very easily could have come out this week 20 years ago and starred Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. The plot, the characters, all of it feels dated and forgotten.\n\nHow you feel about the movie will hinge largely on how you feel about Ryan Reynolds. Why? Because he plays the same character in every movie. Ryan Reynolds in The Hitman's Bodyguard is Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool is Ryan Reynolds in The Proposal is Ryan Reynolds in Van Wilder. And look, Reynolds is a charming guy and he can be fun to watch...for about five minutes.\n\nin The Hitman's Bodyguard he plays Michael Bryce, a former CIA agent who now works as a bodyguard for some of the most evil people on the planet. He is at the top of his game until a Japanese arms dealer is killed while in Michael's care.\n\nFast forward two years. Michael has lost his edge. He lives in his car and pees in an apple juice bottle that for some reason he hangs on to instead of just tossing it out the window trucker style. Michael gets a call from an ex-girlfriend (Daredevil's Elodie Young) who works for Interpol.\n\nShe has been charged with transporting Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) to the Hague, where he will testify about the war crimes of Dukhovich (Gary Oldman), a Belarusian dictator who I guess screenplay writer Tom O'Connor fought every urge to name Pladimir Vutin.\n\nDuring the transport, Kincaid's security detail is intercepted by mercenaries working for Dukhovich. Most of the Interpol team is killed. Kincaid and Agent Roussel, Michael's ex, escape to a safe house. That is where Roussell calls Michael and enlists his help getting Kincaid from England to Holland to testify.\n\nFrom there The Hitman's Bodyguard turns into a road comedy and there are a few laughs along the way, but the keyword is few. Overall, it feels like the majority of this cast is on autopilot. Hell, I bet the studio was looking for \"a Samuel L. Jackson type\" to play Darius and was shocked to learn Jackson himself would be available. Salma Hayek is a different story. She plays Darius' wife and rather than playing a caricature of herself, she is just playing a version of Sofia Vergara that gets to say the F word a lot.\n\nThe only actor that looks like they are trying to be good is Elodie Young, and she is REALLY trying. Trying and failing. Her acting skills and line delivery can be described as \"extra in the Golden Girls\" level bad. Go back and watch and see what I mean. There's a marathon on TV Land every Sunday.\n\nThe script is littered with tropes of 1990s filmmaking that will make you wonder how long The Hitman's Bodyguard has been sitting on a studio's shelf. Darius is a cross between an Uncle Jessie-like cool guy and the magical blackman, which has been it's own genre of movies since the 1980s, but really hit it's peak in 1999 and 2000 (think Legend of Bagger Vance, The Green Mile, The Matrix, Family Man, Final Destination, et al). Bad guys are deadly accurate sharpshooters from miles away, but are too blind to see vans headed right at them.\n\nA man sitting in front of me in the theater actually did a great job of summarizing the whole movie before it even started. He was there with a wife or girlfriend and apparently had forgotten what movie they were there to see, so he asked.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" she said.\n\n\"That title don't make no damn sense,\" he replied. So, she pulls out the ticket to show him that the name of the movie is indeed The Hitman's Bodyguard. He looks at the ticket and then utters a sentence so perfect, that the studio should really have used it in every piece of marketing they released for this movie.\n\n\"Some bad s*** must happen if a hitman needs a bodyguard.\"\n\nIndeed sir.

Rated R for strong violence and language throughout. Running time: 118 minutes.\n\nCritic's rating: \u2605\u2605\n\nCast: Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, and Salma Hayek.\n\nCo-starring Ryan Reynolds as Michael Bryce, a disgraced security expert seeking redemption, and Samuel L. Jackson as his nemesis-turned-client Darius Kincaid -- a murderer-for-hire Michael must reluctantly protect while Darius prepares to testify against a Belarusian dictator accused of war crimes (Gary Oldman) -- the comic action/\u200bbuddy flick serves up an undistinguished bill of fare.\n\nFor plot, there's a bloody yet hard-to-swallow cut of subprime red meat: The Hitman's Bodyguard is gratuitously violent and preposterous. For acting, there's not one but two cheese-stuffed baked potatoes on the plate, with Jackson and Reynolds vying for the audience's attention.\n\nIn place of fresh, crisp dialogue, there's a wilted word salad of vulgar repartee, the most common utterance of which -- this being a Samuel L. Jackson film -- is unprintable.\n\nAt other times, Darius' put-downs are simply head-scratching: \"I've eaten hamburgers that know more about women than you,\" he tells Michael, during one of several man-to-man talks about woman troubles that they manage to squeeze in between escapades eluding assassins on the way to The Hague's International Criminal Court.\n\nTo be sure, there is always a certain pleasure in watching Jackson do his thing: Glare, grin, and then unload with a mouthful of invective, followed by a can of whup-ass.\n\nTRAILER: The Hitman's Bodyguard\n\nThe same does not apply to Salma Hayek, who plays Dariuss' foulmouthed convict wife, Sonia. Promised release from prison if Darius agrees to help put Oldman's Vladislav Dukhovich behind bars, Sonia has little to do except curse loudly and in Spanish (yet not especially colorfully, according to the subtitles).\n\nDarius says he loves her, just as Michael says he loves Amelia (Elodie Yung), an Interpol officer with whom he shares a complicated backstory. Yet this is no rom-com. The Hitman's Bodyguard is all bromance.\n\nThe extent to which you will enjoy it depends less on the sloppily calibrated balance of comedy to bloodshed -- only occasionally in equilibrium, in an absurdist way, and never sublimely so -- than on the delicate chemistry of Reynolds' cucumber-cool persona and Jackson's embodiment of the impulsive id.\n\nDirected by Patrick Hughes (The Expendables 3) from a script by Tom O'Connor (Fire With Fire), The Hitman's Bodyguard seems reverse-engineered to ape every middlebrow late-'80s-to-mid-'90s testosterone-fest, from Lethal Weapon to Bad Boys.\n\nAs Michael and Darius make their way to the Netherlands, it's easy to forget exactly what is at stake for each of them -- hint: It ain't justice -- what with all the long and ludicrous chase sequences, episodes of forced separation followed by implausible reunions and, seemingly, one 11th-hour appearance by a deus ex machina after another.\n\nOnly one fight scene -- between Michael and Dukhovich's henchman Ivan (Yuri Kolokolnikov), who move from restaurant kitchen to hardware store, availing themselves of a hot grill and a nail gun for weapons -- approaches the inspired level of a live-action comic book like, say, John Wick.\n\nDespite all the mayhem, The Hitman's Bodyguard is a surprisingly bland dish. Some folks like to take a nap after a big meal. If it weren't for all the fireballs and f-bombs, you might even be able to get some shut-eye while you're watching The Hitman's Bodyguard.\n\nRelated Items Hitman's bodyguard, Samuel L.

Movies are the product of a million tiny decisions - each of them potentially, chaos theory-style, completely affecting the final product. Imagine, now, the film The Hitman's Bodyguard, which is about the world's most competent bodyguard being tasked to protect the world's most competent hitman. There are literally millions of options here - from tone to cast to plot devices to settings to music - that can be combined to make millions of different movies. Granted, these movies are all a little similar, but they're also mostly (and most importantly) not the same movie.\n\nFollow me so far? Good. So now, let's explore the premise slightly further. Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) was once the world's highest-rated bodyguard, protecting the world's richest (and generally most corrupt and fucked-up) from harm in exchange for filthy lucre. A bungled job guarding a Japanese arms dealer has reduced him to protecting cracked out idiots with his banged-up sedan and seen him separated from Amelia (Elodie Yung), an Interpol agent who was also the love of his life until he blamed her for the aforementioned bungle. Nevertheless, Amelia thinks of Bryce right away when she needs a quick fix in order to protect Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson), the world's most fearsome hitman and its only hope of indicting the corrupt president of Belarus (Gary Oldman) on human rights charges. The president has an endless amount of Eastern European thugs in long leather jackets ready to die for him, so Bryce and Kincaid (who, it goes without saying, hate each other) have to move fast in order to get to the Hague before the timer hits zero.\n\nHow is it that, of all the slight variations and minor tweaks that could possibly happen, The Hitman's Bodyguard plays out exactly like what you'd assume a 2017 action movie starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson would play like? How is it possible that, with all the potential variables that one could apply to a project like this one, seemingly not a single one of them was original and interesting in any way? Does this happen accidentally, the simple result of no one seeing the bigger picture until all the pieces are together? Or is it something more depressing - an intentionally derivative and intensely familiar action movie that's a poster first, a trailer second and a movie dead last?\n\nI'll admit that the trailer had me fooled. Though hardly original, it seemed to showcase a throwback to '90s action films that hinged on the chemistry between the leads (mostly in that they hate each other and lob colourful insults back and forth) rather than, say, original storytelling or a movie premise that wasn't just driving a vehicle into another vehicle. Even that, in itself, would be fine - except that The Hitman's Bodyguard is just another sausage link off of the Nu Image/Millennium production line. Their founder, Avi Lerner, has made a fortune producing film after film starring semi-washed-up action stars in cookie-cutter productions shot for cheap somewhere in Eastern Europe. There's more money in The Hitman's Bodyguard and its stars aren't quite as washed-up, but that's about where the differences end.\n\nReynolds and Jackson are employed to do what they do best: Reynolds is cocky and panicky and loudmouthed while Jackson is apparently unkillable and calls everyone and everything a motherfucker. There should be a baseline of enjoyment just at seeing these people do the thing that we know them to do, and I suppose there is - what enjoyment there is to get from The Hitman's Bodyguard certainly comes from its stars' charisma - but the fact is that Reynolds and Jackson have very little chemistry. They mostly seem to each be doing their respective thing in a vacuum. No matter how much the film plays up the begrudging brotherhood between them, they both seem to be doing their own version of jazz hands on opposite sides of the red carpet premiere. The fact is that they could do this in their sleep - and maybe they are, after all, I've never seen either of them sleep - and the film still manages to squander their talents somehow.\n\nI have to admit that there's something comforting about this type of action premise - it's why movies that sort of came and went in this genre's heyday are so nostalgically appreciated today in the face of significantly less R-rated action buddy comedies. While it's obvious that director Patrick Hughes and writer Tom O'Connor have spent countless hours poring over the work of Shane Black, their spin on it is anemic at best. Though ostensibly an action-comedy, The Hitman's Bodyguard rarely combines both; it's either the leads bickering somewhere in a pasture or shit exploding in the city while guys with machine guns fall off of corniches, but rarely both. Shot in cheap, gauzy digital usually indicative of a much smaller budget, The Hitman's Bodyguard has mostly anonymous action scenes, as competent as they are forgettable. (Most of them are car-based, though I will point out one pretty good foot chase between Reynolds and some goons that culminates in a balls-out hardware store duel.)\n\nReally, the best you can hope for with a premise like this one - the best collection of randomized items, as mentioned above - is that the movie will somehow be weird or idiosyncratic enough to overcome the mundanity of its story. The Hitman's Bodyguard tries for idiosyncratic with the character of Sonia, Kincaid's jailed wife as portrayed by Salma Hayek. Sonia has been, it seems, jailed for her husband's sins, and she spends the entire movie imprisoned and spewing venom at her guards like a five-foot, South American, female version of Jackson. It's certainly Hayek as you've never seen her (especially in a flashback where she takes on five drunken bar patrons in slow-motion, slashing their carotid artery to the strains of Lionel Richie's \"Hello\" - the song's second ironic placement in an action movie this year alone), but it's also pretty pointless - which sums up the long game here pretty adequately.\n\nThere's a version of this movie starring, like, Ryan Kwanten and Samuel L. Jackson (and probably Mickey Rourke in the thankless Oldman role) that would've by-passed cinemas entirely and popped up on Netflix between two seasons of prestige TV you'll never get around to watching. If I'd seen that version, I would not really have been disappointed; it would have been exactly what I expected. The greatest trick The Hitman's Bodyguard ever pulled was making me believe it would be anything but what it actually is: low-effort, low-reward junk. \u25a0", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television_and_Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 350, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television and Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Belarus"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Belarus"}, "type": "loc", "id": "35"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Richie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "307746", "label": {"eng": "Lionel Richie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Lerner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "378664", "label": {"eng": "Avi Lerner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Black", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "444987", "label": {"eng": "Shane Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherfucker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "486397", "label": {"eng": "Motherfucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Image", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "806238", "label": {"eng": "Nu Image"}}]}

Jackson and Ryan Reynolds team up in, but cannot save, an action-comedy that deserved a better writer-directing tandem than it got. Still, the on-screen presences of and chemistry shared by Jackson (\"The Hateful Eight\") and Reynolds (\"Deadpool\") do help elevate the romp somewhat.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" isn't bad, exactly, but it isn't nearly the fun piece of late-summer entertainment it might have been, either.\n\nJackson's Darius Kincaid is a notorious hitman with a body count as big as his ego. To free his imprisoned wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek), Darius strikes a deal with Interpol to testify against brutal Belarusian tyrant Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman).\n\nInterpol must transport Darius from England to Dukhovich's trial in The Netherlands, which proves highly difficult from the start. An agent who survives a deadly attack on the vehicle carrying Darius, Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung of Netflix's \"Daredevil\" series), calls in a ringer.\n\nThat man happens to be her ex, Reynolds' Michael Bryce, a once-highly rated bodyguard who has kept all types -- including criminals -- safe for a pretty penny.\n\nWhen we meet Michael, it is two years earlier. He is protecting a sought-after arms dealer until that man is safely in the air. The man is killed by a sniper who shoots him from a great distance through a small window in the plane that would have flown him to safety.\n\nMichael blames his fall from grace -- he now drives a cheap car and works in the \"mid-level coked-out-attorney market\" -- on Amelia, whom he told of his client's identity. It's something he'd never done before and believes the death can be traced to an Interpol leak.\n\nMichael agrees to help her, only because she offers to help him get back some industry cred if he does -- and make matters worse for him if he doesn't. However, he doesn't initially know the man he'll be shepherding to safety is Darius, who has tried to kill Michael myriad times over the years as Darius has hunted the scumbags Michael was protecting.\n\nOver the course of the roughly two-hour \"Hitman's Bodyguard,\" the pair will fight each other, exchange vulgar insults, try to stay alive while working as a team only intermittently and increasingly bond over Darius giving love advice to Michael.\n\nThere are too few laugh-out-loud moments in the screenplay by Tom O'Connor (2012's \"Fire With Fire\"), such as when Michael's phone lights up with a call from Amelia and the display name is \"Pure Evil.\" The writing never quite sells the budding bromance that is at the heart of the story.\n\nPerhaps more disappointing is the action, which, for the most part, is subpar. Patrick Hughes, who helmed 2014's \"The Expendables 3,\" uses a ton of quick cuts to try to amp up his action sequences, but they still keep the viewer at arm's length. Plus, he pumps loud music over top of them, further keeping you from feeling like you're in the middle of the fury. A big chase through the streets of Amsterdam involving cars -- and boats through the river in the center of the city -- really could have been something in more-talented hands.

Jackson, Gary Oldman, Elodie Yung; R (strong violence and language throughout); in general release\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" brings Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson together in a manic buddy comedy that is heavy on action if a little light and predictable on plot. It's good, but it feels as if it could have been better.\n\nReynolds plays Michael Bryce, a down-and-out bodyguard who was at the top of the personal-protection world until an unknown assassin took out one of his high-priced clients.\n\nJackson plays Darius Kincaid, a legendary incarcerated hit man who has been offered a deal to come to the Hague and testify against the human rights violations of an Eastern European dictator named Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). Kincaid's track record is too bloody to be expunged, but if he cooperates, Interpol has agreed to free his also-imprisoned wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek).\n\nBryce and Kincaid join forces when a team of Dukhovich's goons attack Kincaid's protective convoy, which includes Bryce's Interpol-agent ex-girlfriend, Amelia (Elodie Yung, who plays Elektra in Netflix's \"Daredevil\" series). Kincaid and Amelia manage to escape the bloodbath and, in desperation, she calls in her ex-boyfriend to deliver Kincaid to the trial, promising to restore his AAA bodyguard status if he cooperates.\n\nIt's a simple premise that succeeds largely on the chemistry of Reynolds and Jackson, whose manic dialed-to-11 behavior feels like \"Seinfeld's\" Frank and Estelle Costanza outfitted with guns and combat training. Bryce and Kincaid have plenty of history and are at each other's throats from the outset, united only as a matter of life-and-death necessity.\n\nAs you might expect, the \"Deadpool\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" stars put a lot of R-rated mileage on their odometers, and the one-note gag for Hayek's character is that she's every bit as foulmouthed as her husband. But the best comedy in \"Hitman's Bodyguard\" comes organically between Reynolds and Jackson, much more than when director Patrick Hughes relies on profanity to deliver his punchlines.\n\nYou would expect a Reynolds-Jackson combo to be heavy on profanity, but for a comedy, \"Hitman's Bodyguard\" is also surprisingly violent. Bryce and Kincaid blast their way through a seemingly limitless supply of Dukhovich's henchmen, complete with the expected gunfire and brutality, but other moments -- such as an early scene where Dukhovich executes a potential witness' family -- mark strange tone changes that feel a step too far for the genre. Other scenes that try to humanize characters like Kincaid also feel odd in context as well.\n\nHughes really delivers on a sequence of escalating action sequences that match fantastic choreography, camera work and editing to create some genuine adrenaline-pumping exchanges. Combined with the chemistry between the two leads, the action sequences are enough to carry a film that weakens once you look beyond its highlights.\n\nThe plot surprises aren't that surprising, and at 118 minutes, \"Hitman's Bodyguard\" feels a little too long. But fans of Reynolds and Jackson will probably be more than happy to see their favorite actors push each other's buttons. Scaling back the more extreme R-rated content and maintaining a more consistent comic tone might have produced a smoother final product. \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" isn't quite as good as it could have been, but for a mid-August release, sometimes \"good enough\" is the goal.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodybuard\" is rated R for strong violence and language throughout; running time: 118 minutes.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100, "id": 679, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 680, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100, "id": 974, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Computer_Graphics", "wgt": 100, "id": 1025, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Computer Graphics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Bioinformatics", "wgt": 100, "id": 1331, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Bioinformatics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 1694, "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Education"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307424", "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association of America film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309008", "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309393", "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309735", "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "311558", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313404", "label": {"eng": "Pulp Fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "347027", "label": {"eng": "Seinfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "349356", "label": {"eng": "Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "641252", "label": {"eng": "Elektra (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lodie_Yung", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "745907", "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lodie Yung"}}]}

It has been a really disappointing year in terms of big studio movies, and an action film set in Manchester, Coventry and eventually Holland, looked absolutely set to join a season full of duds, but The Hitman's Bodyguard, starring an on-form Samuel L. Jackson and a post-Deadpool Ryan Reynolds, could be the saviour of the summer.\n\nOur story begins in London, some time in the past. Reynolds' bodyguard Michael Bryce is on a job protecting a VIP. The lavish opening suggest that Bryce has it all; the luxury home, beautiful girlfriend, top-notch motor, and an arsenal of weapons to protect a small country, let alone a wobbly middle-aged businessman. The job seems simple, but its not too long before it all goes south and Bryce loses his all important Triple-A rating and the high-profile clients that come with it.\n\nFast forward in time post-titles where we find Bryce down on his luck. That Triple-A rating meant everything to him and his business, and now he finds himself having to take any job going, which includes taking on Richard E. Grant's slimy London businessman. It's not long before Bryce gets a call from former girlfriend and Interpol agent Amelia Ryder (Elodie Yung), who calls him out of the blue to help deliver notorious hitman Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) from Manchester to the International Courts of Justice at The Hague, Kincaid being the star witness in a war crimes trial against Belarus dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman).\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is enjoyable from the off, the film very much suited to the current image and comedy of its leading man, Ryan Reynolds - think Deadpool but without the costume. Jackson to is on top form as the battered hitman, his character desperate to get away from Bryce and reunite with his spouse, a hilarious bad-ass potty-mouthed woman named Sonia, played by a brilliant against-type Salma Hayek, who is holed up in Holland, bait for Kincaid's testimony.\n\nThe action comes thick and fast, presented in almost cartoon-like fashion by director Patrick Hughes (The Expendables 3, Red Hill). Although most of the action set-pieces are ludicrous, most have been executed with practical effects rather than CGI, a thrilling Amsterdam-set speed boat/ motorcycle chase one the many highlights. Of course, CGI is used, and when it is it is completely over the top and seemingly not embarrassed of the extremes it will go to, and yes, it uses its 15 certificate in the UK to the max, the film full of glorious over-the-top violence and outlandish swearing by all involved.\n\nApart from its brilliant action, The Hitman's Bodyguard works so well because of the fantastic chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson. Riffing everything from The Bodyguard to Midnight Run, Tom O'Connor's excellent screenplay provides the basis for the two to go to the places where they work at their best, and the film is an absolute delight to watch because of it. Gary Oldman is also worthy of mention as the brutal bad guy, and while he's not given as much screen time that we'd quite have liked, his sinister portrayal of dastardly Dukhovich, is also a joy to watch.\n\nA genuine surprise, The Hitman's Bodyguard is not going to bother the red carpet awards ceremonies later in the year, but it is going to find an audience in a summer full of let-downs from the big boys. It's an explosive thrill-ride, hilarious throughout, and perhaps one of the most entertaining films of the year.\n\nSee it.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard review by Paul Heath, August 2017.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}, "type": "loc", "id": "97668"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99729"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309120", "label": {"eng": "Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309393", "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "311558", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322968", "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_2#Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "462530", "label": {"eng": "The Expendables 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "657568", "label": {"eng": "Richard E.

Jackson and Ryan Reynolds team up in, but cannot save, an action-comedy that deserved a better writer-directing tandem than it got. Still, the on-screen presences of and chemistry shared by Jackson (\"The Hateful Eight\") and Reynolds (\"Deadpool\") do help elevate the romp somewhat.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" isn't bad, exactly, but it isn't nearly the fun piece of late-summer entertainment it might have been, either.\n\nJackson's Darius Kincaid is a notorious hitman with a body count as big as his ego. To free his imprisoned wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek), Darius strikes a deal with Interpol to testify against brutal Belarusian tyrant Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman).\n\nInterpol must transport Darius from England to Dukhovich's trial in The Netherlands, which proves highly difficult from the start. An agent who survives a deadly attack on the vehicle carrying Darius, Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung of Netflix's \"Daredevil\" series), calls in a ringer.\n\nThat man happens to be her ex, Reynolds' Michael Bryce, a once-highly rated bodyguard who has kept all types -- including criminals -- safe for a pretty penny.\n\nWhen we meet Michael, it is two years earlier. He is protecting a sought-after arms dealer until that man is safely in the air. The man is killed by a sniper who shoots him from a great distance through a small window in the plane that would have flown him to safety.\n\nMichael blames his fall from grace -- he now drives a cheap car and works in the \"mid-level coked-out-attorney market\" -- on Amelia, whom he told of his client's identity. It's something he'd never done before and believes the death can be traced to an Interpol leak.\n\nMichael agrees to help her, only because she offers to help him get back some industry cred if he does -- and make matters worse for him if he doesn't. However, he doesn't initially know the man he'll be shepherding to safety is Darius, who has tried to kill Michael myriad times over the years as Darius has hunted the scumbags Michael was protecting.\n\nOver the course of the roughly two-hour \"Hitman's Bodyguard,\" the pair will fight each other, exchange vulgar insults, try to stay alive while working as a team only intermittently and increasingly bond over Darius giving love advice to Michael.\n\nThere are too few laugh-out-loud moments in the screenplay by Tom O'Connor (2012's \"Fire With Fire\"), such as when Michael's phone lights up with a call from Amelia and the display name is \"Pure Evil.\" The writing never quite sells the budding bromance that is at the heart of the story.\n\nPerhaps more disappointing is the action, which, for the most part, is subpar. Patrick Hughes, who helmed 2014's \"The Expendables 3,\" uses a ton of quick cuts to try to amp up his action sequences, but they still keep the viewer at arm's length. Plus, he pumps loud music over top of them, further keeping you from feeling like you're in the middle of the fury. A big chase through the streets of Amsterdam involving cars -- and boats through the river in the center of the city -- really could have been something in more-talented hands. Like the movie itself, it is a real missed opportunity.\n\nTo be fair, a less-ambitious sequence in which Michael is chased through businesses in the city is a better-made piece of work.\n\nSo it's largely up to Jackson and Reynolds. They're fun together, as you would expect, but they can do only so much with the ammunition they're given.\n\nAnd, sure, bullets aplenty fly in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" but it just doesn't have enough firepower.\n\nRated: R for strong violence and language throughout.\n\n>> Movie review: 'Wind River' a chilling, compelling drama in harsh setting", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply", "wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "wgt": 100, "id": 401, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/New_Age", "wgt": 100, "id": 548, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/New Age"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "166"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99729"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302901", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "311558", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312160", "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "335511", "label": {"eng": "Bromance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_leak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "342809", "label": {"eng": "Internet leak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_O'Connor_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "423663", "label": {"eng": "Tom O'Connor (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_2#Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "462530", "label": {"eng": "The Expendables 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lodie_Yung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "745907", "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lodie Yung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hateful_Eight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1283758", "label": {"eng": "The Hateful Eight"}}]}

Jackson, center right, and Ryan Reynolds in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard.\" (Lionsgate via AP)\n\nIf you're feeling nostalgic for a '90s-style buddy action comedy with some early-2000s edge, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is the film for you.\n\nDirected by Patrick Hughes (\"The Expendables 3\"), the script by Tom O'Connor could have been written in 2005 and never updated, as a ripoff Tarantino that thinks swearing stands in for wit, with the kind of casual sexism and objectification of women that movies got away with before we all tired of it.\n\nBut this is a film that lives and dies on its stars, and Samuel L. Jackson, as the hitman, and Ryan Reynolds, as the bodyguard, working within their already well-established personas, make for a fine pair of unlikely partners. Jackson, in particular, is a treat to watch, whether singing Italian folk songs with nuns or doling out love advice via speakerphone in a car chase.\n\nThe plot concerns testimony that the hitman, Darius Kincaid (Jackson), is to give against a bloodthirsty Belarussian dictator, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). In exchange for the release of his feisty wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek), from a Dutch prison (her crime is never explained), Kincaid promises to offer proof of Dukhovich's war crimes.\n\nWhen the Interpol transfer of Kincaid goes south, agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) calls an old boyfriend for backup, an \"executive security agent\" who's fallen on hard times, Michael Bryce (Reynolds). Bryce and Kincaid have a long and thorny history as adversaries, so their 24-hour jaunt from England to Amsterdam is quite eventful. Thanks to Dukhovich's thugs, who are trying to prevent Kincaid from testifying, it's also violently action-packed.\n\nIt's unfortunate that \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" hits U.S. theaters this particular weekend -- it's no fault of the distributor, but it's unlikely audiences will be entertained by the multiple scenes of evil henchmen plowing vehicles through crowds of bystanders in quaint city squares.\n\nThe film demonstrates a hypocritical attitude about murder -- while Kincaid and Bryce race across town to indict a dictator for murdering civilians, they remorselessly leave a wake of bloody bodies in the streets. They're bad guys, but the tricky morality doesn't quite jell.\n\nMoreover, the violence of \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is thuddingly, exhaustingly dull. It's not shot in an interesting way, the cinematic geography is mush, and the stunts and action choreography are nothing to write home about. As the film pushes the two-hour mark, it just becomes a boring blur.\n\nWhat \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" * 1\u00bd stars out of four * Run time 1:58 * Rating R * Content Strong violence and language throughout\n\nOrder movie tickets in advance", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100, "id": 126, "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302901", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302958", "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304918", "label": {"eng": "Quentin Tarantino"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306079", "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309393", "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315280", "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "327085", "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_2#Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "462530", "label": {"eng": "The Expendables 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}]}

Jackson star in the action-comedy \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" which also features Gary Oldman and Salma Hayek.\n\nWell, it's August. These are the doldrums. The summer, as a movie season at least, is effectively over, and the fall hasn't started yet. Perhaps for that reason, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" seems just a little better than it really is.\n\nFor the record, it's a pleasing action movie that aspires to be something more, but doesn't quite achieve its intention. But it really is pleasing and better than routine, and it has a way of topping itself. So if, after about 80 minutes, you think the movie is offering you its big climax, that it's giving you all it's got, it's not. It goes on to catch a second wind and gets bigger and wilder and even more satisfying.\n\nThe movie also is a chance to appreciate Samuel L. Jackson in something close to his purest form. Other movies, after all, have other reasons for being. There are roles to be cast and actors to play them. But it's hard to imagine any reason for this movie's existing but for the fact that Jackson was willing to be in it. It's impossible even to imagine it even making sense without the menacing joviality that he brings to it -- and also his history with the audience, our shared feeling of knowing this actor and of being in on his particular comic wavelength.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" pairs Jackson here with Ryan Reynolds, and sprinkled throughout we get moments that suggest an attempt -- by Tom O'Connor's screenplay and Patrick Hughes' direction -- to turn the movie into a buddy action-comedy. But O'Connor and Hughes' aren't quite sure whether they're making a buddy action-comedy or lampooning the genre, and so their attempt is stuck somewhere in between.\n\nThis is less a problem than it sounds, though, because, lampoon or not, Jackson and Reynolds are good together.\n\nReynolds plays Bryce, a former CIA agent specializing in offering first-class (\"Triple A rated\") protection for corporate clients who feel their lives might be in danger. In an opening scene, we meet him in flashback, giving the deluxe treatment to a Japanese businessman. He and his team escort the gentleman to the tarmac and see that he is safely boarded onto his private jet. And then just as they are all congratulating themselves for a job well done, the businessman is assassinated through the window of the plane.\n\nThis is what passes for slapstick in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" -- assassination as punchline. If you don't think you could possibly consider that funny, this fine cinematic exercise is not for you.\n\nAnyway, two years later, Bryce needs a shave; his love life is nonexistent and his once top-flight business is a shadow of itself. Then one day he gets a phone call from his estranged ex-girlfriend, an Interpol agent played by the French actress Elodie Yung: She needs him to escort a notorious hit man (Jackson, of course) to The Hague, where he is to testify against a really, really horrible war criminal (Gary Oldman, of course).\n\nThe only catch is that there are many dozens of heavily armed criminals and corrupt Interpol agents who want to make sure that this testimony never happens.\n\nDoes this story seem familiar? The last time somebody made this movie it was called \"Hot Pursuit,\" with Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara -- essentially a road trip comedy about a pair of opposites, whose slowly blossoming friendship keeps getting interrupted by violent interludes.\n\nThat movie collapsed into total discord, but \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" finds a tonal universe in which the violence and the comedy are not in conflict. Then again, perhaps the tone didn't really have to be arrived at. Perhaps the tone was just a given, something that was automatically built in from the moment Samuel Jackson appeared on the set.\n\nAside from the principals, who are everything they should be, there is Oldman, who is appropriately repellent in a couple of key scenes; and Elodie Yung, who makes a nice impression of strength and purpose as the Interpol agent. In a sense, Oldman and Yung play dramatic characters in the midst of a comedy, but the filmmakers weave them into the flow. Meanwhile, Salma Hayek stands out in a comic role as the hitman's impossibly vulgar, assertive wife.\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are lots of car chases here, and they actually aren't boring.

Part of the film feels like Joel Silver or Jerry Bruckheimer in their heyday, and that's not a bad thing. Lately, we haven't seen many movies with that sort of energy. So many films are huge in scale that something a little more down to Earth feels welcome. There's a lot to like here... and a lot to criticize. The movie is at its best when we get to have fun enjoying Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson spar back and forth. Buddy camaraderie is something we don't get a lot of these days in our action movies. Mostly, we just have to take in the spectacle, hire some bland, uncharismatic actors, and just ride it out. The Hitman's Bodyguard at least tries to give us some characterization and some humor to make it fun, even when Jackson drops his famous MF-bombs every few minutes.\n\nIt's too bad the action is so loud and weightless. There is one sequence in a toolshop towards the end of the film with Reynolds and a European thug that is well shot and innovative, even through all the shakycam (it's done in one seemingly long take), but for the most part, there's nothing you haven't seen before, watered down through so many John Woo films, a copy of a copy of a copy. There's also some ill-advised CGI usage that took me right out of the movie; a shot of a boat moving on a river, of all things, looks so point-and-click as to be distracting. Had director Patrick Hughes gone more practical, we may have had some visually-interesting action, and sometimes it works. Mostly, though, you wonder if the actors were even on set that day.\n\nBryce (Reynolds) is a down-on-his-luck hired protector; during one mission, his client is shot and killed, and he's been mostly slumming it ever since, protecting Eurotrash and celebrities. But his former girlfriend, Amelia (Elodia Yung) is hot on the trail of international leader -- and probable war criminal -- Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman, phoning it in), and needs Bryce's help to bring in world-renowned assassin Darius Kincaid to the Hague to testify against Dukhovich. If Bryce can get Kincaid there on time, Kincaid's testimony could put Dukhovich away for good. Of course, Dukhovich isn't going to take this lying down, so he sends his teams to take Kincaid out. If you've ever seen a buddy action movie before, you'll know that Bryce and Kincaid don't exactly get along, and so they must figure out how to trust one another if they are going to survive.\n\nThe film works best when it stays focused on Reynolds and Jackson. They do have a nice chemistry, and both actors can be funny together, and even reach a kind of poignancy. Turns out (and again, if you've ever seen a movie before, you'll see this coming a mile off) that Kincaid may have some blame for Bryce's current predicament, which is the primary source of their conflict. Both have their own kind of morality, and come to admire the other's. Plus, Kincaid is trying to get his wife free if he can. She's played with fervor by Salma Hayek, and although she doesn't share much screen time with our heroes, she seems to be having a blast.\n\nMost of the time, though, the film struggles with its action set pieces to fill the time. We're fortunate to have both Reynolds and Jackson during those downtime moments, because when the action starts, it's booming, cacophonous, and not very interesting. Patrick Hughes is no stranger to action, but there's not much here that is very arresting. The Hitman's Bodyguard tries to give the action some edge by not holding back the gore, but all the sequences start to run together into one big headache-inducing shakycam fest. The screening I attended had the sound out of balance, and the action was so loud that if the actors were making jokes during the shootouts, I missed them. Still, I don't feel like I missed much.\n\nI'd love to see Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson in another movie like this. They have a good rapport and are genuinely entertaining together. Unfortunately, The Hitman's Bodyguard isn't the best vehicle for their considerable talents. There isn't a lot of ambition in The Hitman's Bodyguard, but that's fine; the movie works when it feels like it just wants to entertain, and not re-invent the wheel. If we got more Reynolds/Jackson interaction, and less generic action, I could recommend The Hitman's Bodyguard.

Jackson are movie stars for a reason. They may not always pick the most successful properties, but when they're in their element, audiences connect with them and want to see them do more. While actors typically look for roles that will challenge them and broaden their range (a move that's both creatively fulfilling and career savvy), there's something to be said for playing the type that created a fanbase in the first place. In The Hitman's Bodyguard, Reynolds is playing the wise-ass we all know and love and Jackson is the badass we all know and love. Putting them together makes for a fun team up, and their chemistry lifts the movie through even its laziest moments.\n\nMichael Bryce (Reynolds) is a \"protection agent\" (i.e. bodyguard) who has fallen on hard times after his last client was sniped in the head. Two years after that botched job, Bryce has a way to get his standing back when his ex-girlfriend and Interpol agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) offers him a gig to escort notorious assassin Darius Kincaid (Jackson) to the Hague to testify against war criminal Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). While Kincaid says he can get to the Hague just fine on his own, he agrees to let Bryce be his escort even though he's tried to kill him on 28 previous occasions. The mismatched duo makes their way across Europe, dodging Dukhovich's goons and trying not to kill each other.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is almost working overtime not to reinvent the wheel. It's basically Midnight Run but with Reynolds and Jackson playing their most famous types. Reynolds has a dry, sardonic wit that sometimes bubbles up to inchoate rage, and Jackson says \"motherfucker\" a lot as he swings between calm badass to angry badass. You know who these actors are, and while arguably they've given these same kind of performances in better movies (to name just a few, Reynolds with Deadpool, Waiting..., and Adventureland and Jackson with Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Die Hard with a Vengeance), there's still something comforting in the familiarity. While I wouldn't want these two actors to play these kinds of characters in every single movie, there's nothing wrong with watching them bounce off each other, especially when it looks like they're having a blast doing it.\n\nThe strength of the film basically rests entirely on Reynolds and Jackson. While Oldman is collecting a paycheck and Salma Hayek has a few good scenes as Kincaid's wife, as an actioner, you see that director Patrick Hughes is being left behind by people who are pushing the genre forward. While I don't expect everyone to be as good as David Leitch, Chad Stahleski, or Gareth Evans, Hughes' direction is the definition of serviceable. You can kind of follow where a set piece is going, but it rarely has the momentum necessary to really surprise you. For example, there's a scene where Bryce is following Kincaid on a motorcycle, and Hughes gets a lot of good coverage of the motorcycle, and it ends with a neat explosion, but there's nothing memorable about it. The movie has a hard-R, and while there's plenty of bloodshed, it doesn't really leave an impression. Your biggest takeaway will be that cars explode very easily in this movie.\n\nEventually, even Reynolds and Jackson aren't enough to salvage the movie as the plot lurches into a third act that feels heavy on set pieces but low on stakes. Without exciting action to carry the picture, we're left wondering why events are transpiring. For example, at one point, the goons go after Bryce and Kincaid, which makes no sense since Kincaid is the one who is supposed to be testifying against Dukhovich. But the thinking seemed to be, \"We need to split up our leads and give them each their own action scene, so here we are.\" It's lazy screenwriting, and it works against the picture, not only because it makes no sense, but also because it removes the strongest element -- Reynolds and Jackson sharing the screen.\n\nBecause it lacks anything particularly notable or memorable, The Hitman's Bodyguard is a prime example of disposable cinema. It's the kind of movie you watch on an airplane or when you want a lazy night in. It doesn't demand to be seen because it doesn't demand anything of itself that hasn't been done better in better movies. That's not an unforgivable sin, and movies that play by the rules have their place. Not every film has to be a game-changer, and The Hitman's Bodyguard is more than happy to play a familiar game.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television_and_Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 350, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television and Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}, "type": "loc", "id": "97668"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309735", "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "311558", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313404", "label": {"eng": "Pulp Fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315280", "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherfucker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "486397", "label": {"eng": "Motherfucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Brown_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "577430", "label": {"eng": "Jackie Brown (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting..._(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "808802", "label": {"eng": "Waiting...

Jackson in a buddy action comedy? That concept would be hard to mess up.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is one hard-working movie.\n\nYou could get whiplash in the first 15 minutes, as the story careens around Europe, setting up a complicated plot involving a Belarusian dictator (Gary Oldman), the International Criminal Court and how assassin Darius Kincaid (Jackson) somehow fits into it all.\n\nOh, and Darius' wife (Salma Hayek) is in a Dutch prison for some reason. And bodyguard Michael Bryce (Reynolds) is enlisted by his ex-girlfriend (Elodie Yung) to escort Darius to The Hague, while pretty much everyone is trying to kill them. Also, there's a mole at Interpol who keeps sabotaging their efforts.\n\nI think that's everything. It doesn't matter much, since the only reason to watch \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is to enjoy the two stars. Director Patrick Hughes also made \"The Expendables 3,\" so macho banter is in his skill set. So is bloody, bone-crunching action, which he at least stages cleverly. The narrow streets and canals of Amsterdam make a pretty good place for a boat/motorcycle/car chase.\n\nWhen Hughes lets his leads (and his audience) breathe a little, there's some fun to be had. Reynolds subverted his slick pretty-boy image in \"Deadpool,\" and here he takes it to comedic extremes, playing Michael as a \"AAA rated\" perfectionist whose finesse is constantly thwarted by his protectee's improvisations. Darius is a tailor-made Jackson character, so he's foul-mouthed and funny, if not the least bit original.\n\nReynolds and Jackson seem to be improvising in many of their scenes, which is when the film becomes entertaining. They take turns being \"crazy guy\" and \"straight man,\" while somehow staying in character. Hughes is going for a \"Midnight Run\"-style caper, and in these moments, he nearly succeeds.\n\nHughes and writer Tom O'Connor never tone down their summer-blockbuster aspirations, choosing to emulate Michael Bay on probably half the budget. The story makes no sense, the supporting characters are poorly written, every twist is either absurd or obvious.

What does that mean? Well, you can count on an asinine story, distracting action, and wafer-thin plot devices that shouldn't - in ANY world - be met with positive outcomes. Tom O'Connor's script is a two-hour excuse to send Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson on a violent road trip, plus a few extra scenes where Salma Hayek screams bilingual insults like a Barrio banshee. That's about it. Unnecessarily overlong like so many films before, but there's a reason why intentions are so simple - because, against all odds, Hughes succeeds where others have failed. Don't ask me how (but I'll tell ya anyway).\n\nIt all starts with Belarusian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). Interpol wants to put this murderous tyrant away for good, but their trial witnesses keep getting murdered. With no other options, they offer incarcerated assassin Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) a plea bargain for his also-incarcerated wife (Sonia, played by Salma Hayek) if he testifies. Kincaid holds some informational A-bomb, and given the scenario, he agrees. Agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) leads Kincaid's escort detail to The Hague, but they're ambushed almost immediately. The two barely escape to a nearby safehouse. Interpol has a leak, and no one can be trusted. This forces Roussel to call in the only person she can trust - her ex-husband, disgraced security contractor Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds). Kincaid's new handler from London to The Hague.\n\nThinking back, that's probably more context than you need. Sorry! The Hitman's Bodyguard is really just a slapstick vessel for Samuel L. Jackson's masterful delivery of \"m#th&rf$ck*r!\" Every single line of dialogue sees Jackson finesse an \"M.F.\" at the beginning, end - hell, even in the middle of sentences! Has there ever been a better pronunciation of such profanity? Each cuss like a child who's just discovered their favorite new word, exploring the vast meaning held in such a taboo collection of letters. We're talking South Park: The Movie levels of R-rated no-nos, mouthed by the Picasso of verbal dirtiness. Jackson's emphatic potty mouth is our only source of reliable entertainment in these trying times - and I say we need it more than ever.\n\nNothing about The Hitman's Bodyguard should be taken seriously. Does that deem stating? Gary Oldman plays an acid-washed dictator who orders hits like he's swatting flies while standing international trial. Jackson takes a bullet to the calf early on, yet can be seen jumping off ledges and landing without reaction. Reynolds - I mean, the seat belt gag should have killed him. Hughes isn't interested in mortal restrictions, instead evoking action-cartoon spectacles akin to McG blockbuster fare. Don't scoff at the comparison. It's all fun and no ego, playing into the ridiculous stunts and unflinching heroes standing in front of indulgent explosions like all cool actioners do.\n\nCasting is key, and the pairing of Reynolds' by-the-numbers perfectionist with Jackson's run-and-gun psychopath makes for combative (also necessary) chemistry. Maybe it's less Hughes' exploitation of genre norms and more Jackson's demeanor that makes stand-in-front-of-explosions snapshots so fun. It's Sammy J, tatt'ed up and not giving a single f*ck about the flaming derbies falling behind him. Who ISN'T going to love that? Reynolds gets all neurotic and practical, only to have Jackson laugh like a maniac when some MacGruber-type folly occurs. \"Well at least we have the criminal's van,\" Reynolds says. Cue a rogue bullet blowing up said van, and Jackson erupting with hearty enjoyment at Reynolds' exasperated face. One master planner and the nudge who revels in every single step going wrong. A tango that Reynolds and Jackson mock so well.\n\nHughes is painting by numbers when it comes to Oldman's Eastern European evilness, forced bonding between his leading duo, things of this nature. Take that for what you will. There's no denying how ludicrous a The Hitman's Bodyguard comic would be, let alone something cinematic. Thankfully, SOMEHOW, said foolishness ends up being the film's most endearing quality. Salma Hayek stabbing jugulars with broken beer bottles in slow motion, vehicles exploding at random, humans falling from tremendous heights with little-to-no damage taken - all insane moments, and all totally enjoyable. Hayek's bloody, bananas barroom brawl especially. Be steady, mi coraz\u00f3n.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is a rung above syndicated equivalents you might find cycling through 10PM time slots on TNT or FXX. The kind of movie you put on as white noise, only to watch the whole thing without trying. As the word \"m#th&rf$ck*r\" loses meaning, you can't help but appreciate a wholly predictable - yet unapologetically confident - action goof that's far funnier than it should be.

Recycling vintage character types, tropes and even politics, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" already feels like you're half-watching it on TNT on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nDirected by \"The Expendables 3\" director Patrick Hughes, the script by Tom O'Connor could have been written in 2005 and never updated, as a ripoff Tarantino that thinks swearing stands in for wit, with the kind of casual sexism and objectification of women that movies got away with before we all got sick of it.\n\nBut this is a film that lives and dies on its stars, and Samuel L. Jackson, as the hitman, and Ryan Reynolds, as the bodyguard, working within their already well-established personas, make for a fine pair of unlikely partners, and hit a few well-placed punchlines with expert delivery. Jackson, in particular, is a treat to watch, whether singing Italian folk songs with nuns, or doling out love advice via speakerphone during a car chase.\n\nThe plot concerns testimony that the hitman, Darius Kincaid (Jackson), is supposed to give against a bloodthirsty Belarussian dictator, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). In exchange for the release of his feisty wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek) from a Dutch prison (it's never explained why she's in prison, however), Kincaid promises to offer proof of Dukhovich's war crimes.\n\nWhen the Interpol transfer of Kincaid goes south, agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) calls up an old boyfriend for backup, an \"executive security agent\" who's fallen on hard times, Michael Bryce (Reynolds). Bryce and Kincaid have a long and thorny history as adversaries, so their 24-hour jaunt from England to Amsterdam proves to be quite eventful. Thanks to Dukhovich's thugs, who are trying to prevent Kincaid from testifying, it's also violently action-packed.\n\nIt's unfortunate that \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" hits U.S. theaters this particular weekend -- it's no fault of the distributor, but it's unlikely audiences will be entertained by the multiple scenes of evil henchmen plowing vehicles through quaint city squares, mowing down innocent bystanders.\n\nThe film demonstrates a hypocritical attitude about murder -- while Kincaid and Bryce race across town to indict a dictator for murdering civilians, they remorselessly leave a wake of bloody bodies in the streets. They're bad guys, but the tricky morality doesn't quite gel.\n\nMoreover, the violence of \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is thuddingly, exhaustingly dull. It's not shot in any particularly interesting way, the cinematic geography is mush, and the stunts and action choreography are nothing to write home about. As the film pushes the two-hour mark, it just becomes a boring blur.\n\nSpeaking of blur -- Hughes shoots every scene with open windows providing backlight, creating a gauzy haze throughout the whole film. It makes no sense why every scene looks like the lens has been smeared with Vaseline. It doesn't even soften the edges of the brutally bad CGI.\n\nThe problem with \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" aside from the dodgy filmmaking craft, is that this story is the least interesting tale to tell about these characters. The flashbacks, to Kincaid's first kill, and his meet-cute with Sonia, are juicy snippets of stories that would have made for a better movie. This film should have traded the hitman's bodyguard for his wife -- she's the most compelling character in it.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "166"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99729"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302901", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302958", "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304918", "label": {"eng": "Quentin Tarantino"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306079", "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307334", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309120", "label": {"eng": "Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309129", "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309197", "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309393", "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_(decade)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "312332", "label": {"eng": "2000s (decade)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315280", "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "322968", "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330000", "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "396484", "label": {"eng": "Objectification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_O'Connor_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "423663", "label": {"eng": "Tom O'Connor (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_2#Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "462530", "label": {"eng": "The Expendables 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lodie_Yung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "745907", "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lodie Yung"}}]}

Somehow, this little behind-the-scenes vignette says more about the experience of watching the film than probably anything I could put together on my own.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is about a hundred and ten minutes of stale gags punctuated at odd intervals by remarkably familiar feeling stunt work that just didn't work for me.\n\nRyan Reynolds is a formerly great - AAA-rated, as he reminds us frequently - executive security provider who is contracted by his saucy Interpol ex-lover (played by Elodie Yung, identified in Reynolds' contacts as \"Pure Evil\") to protect a hitman played by Samuel L. Jackson, who is on his way to testify against a brutal eastern European dictator being tried for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\n\nJackson has agreed to provide this testimony in exchange for the release from an Amsterdam prison of his wife, played by Salma Hayek. The problem is that the Belurussian dictator, played by Gary Oldman in a performance so phoned in you can almost feel his impatience waiting for the ink on his check to dry, seems to have every mercenary in Europe on his payroll and they are all gunning for Jackson. Murder, mayhem, explosions, and double-crosses abound.\n\nThe major selling point of The Hitman's Bodyguard is the pairing of Reynolds and Jackson as the Odd Couple, and in that regard, it mostly hits the mark. Reynolds has built a pretty unique niche for himself as the handsome smartass and has parlayed that talent into several quite well-received films, including last year's mammoth worldwide sensation, Deadpool. Samuel L. Jackson, well, you know what he does, and he does it here. A lot. Reynolds quips, Jackson swears, someone fires a gun, everybody runs, they jump in a car, shit blows up; lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nAt one point the film even acknowledges the fact that it is parodying these actors personas on screen when Reynolds says that Jackson has \"ruined the word motherf***er\" for him. Unfortunately for everyone involved, simply recognizing the fact that you're being derivative doesn't excuse you from hacky dialogue, and boy-howdy does The Hitman's Bodyguard have some hacky dialogue.\n\nHave you ever seen those videos where some nerd with too much time on their hands strings together a bunch of videos to make it look like the President is singing \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" or something? That's exactly what The Hitman's Bodyguard feels like, a greatest hits compilation of proven Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson zingers, the AM Gold of action comedies.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard isn't all doom and gloom, there are glimmers of creative thought sprinkled in there as well. There's one sequence in particular in which Reynolds is being chased by the central goon through the streets of Amsterdam that leads of a pretty fun hand-to-hand action setpiece in a restaurant and eventually a hardware store, but by the time it rolls around the audience has pretty much lost interest in the goings-on.\n\nIt's even more frustrating because this sequence, the best one in the film, probably cost 1% what any of the other crazy overblown car chases in the film did. The film does manage to eke out a laugh or two on the way to its overblown '90s action-esque ending, but there is nowhere near enough payoff for the commitment.\n\nWhat can I say, Reynolds and Jackson fans will have little reason to complain if they walk in to the film expecting them to behave as they have in most of their recent work, but anyone hoping to see an interesting, engaging buddy dynamic will probably leave disappointed.\n\nEven the action, which is pretty much all the film has to fill the void between contentious bouts of banter among the leads, isn't particularly exciting. I wanted to like this film because I am a fan of Ryan and Sam, but all The Hitman's Bodyguard inspired in me was the desire to go back and revisit the films where they were actually good, and not just Tickle-Me-Smartass dolls programmed with the same gags they'd done for years when you squeeze them.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}, "type": "loc", "id": "97668"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99729"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310802", "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "311558", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315324", "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324819", "label": {"eng": "Mercenary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "334852", "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Eclipse_of_the_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "620358", "label": {"eng": "Total Eclipse of the Heart"}}]}

Jackson and Salma Hayek play husband and wife in upcoming action-comedy film 'The Hitman's Bodyguard', their characters barely meet. The reason? Both characters - Darius and Sonia Kincaid - start the movie in jail. Jackson's Darius is a dangerous and prolific assassin, who must give evidence in the Hague against a merciless Eastern European dictator (played by Gary Oldman) to ensure his reign of terror comes to an end. Hayek's Sonia is Darius' equally notorious wife, who he hopes to spring from prison as part of a plea bargain. 'The Hitman's Bodyguard' also stars Ryan Reynolds who portrays Michael Bryce, a down-on-his-luck bodyguard, who is roped in to protect his mortal enemy Darius, as they race against time to get to the Hague. Both Jackson and Hayek take part in some high-action fight scenes and whereas Jackson uses a stunt man, Hayek told Reuters she took great pleasure in doing her own moves, despite regretting it the next day. Jackson and Hayek both say they would like a sequel to 'The Hitman's Bodyguard', but that they'd like to act together more in it. Discussing potential plots, they agreed that they would like to see Sonia rescue Darius, with Hayek saying, \"I'd like to rescue a man, for a change.\" 'The Hitman's Bodyguard' will be hitting screens on August 17.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 110, "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100, "id": 974, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304758", "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_performer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304932", "label": {"eng": "Stunt performer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309735", "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "328001", "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349356", "label": {"eng": "Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_combat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "378360", "label": {"eng": "Stage combat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}]}

These are the doldrums. The summer, as a movie season at least, is effectively over, and the fall hasn't started yet. Perhaps for that reason, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" seems just a little better than it really is.\n\nFor the record, it's a pleasing action movie that aspires to be something more, but doesn't quite achieve its intention. But it really is pleasing and better than routine, and it has a way of topping itself. So if, after about 80 minutes, you think the movie is offering you its big climax, that it's giving you all it's got, it's not. It goes on to catch a second wind and gets bigger and wilder and even more satisfying.\n\nThe movie also is a chance to appreciate Samuel L. Jackson in something close to his purest form. Other movies, after all, have other reasons for being. There are roles to be cast and actors to play them. But it's hard to imagine any reason for this movie's existing but for the fact that Jackson was willing to be in it. It's impossible even to imagine it even making sense without the menacing joviality that he brings to it -- and also his history with the audience, our shared feeling of knowing this actor and of being in on his particular comic wavelength.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" pairs Jackson here with Ryan Reynolds, and sprinkled throughout we get moments that suggest an attempt -- by Tom O'Connor's screenplay and Patrick Hughes' direction -- to turn the movie into a buddy action-comedy. But O'Connor and Hughes' aren't quite sure whether they're making a buddy action-comedy or lampooning the genre, and so their attempt is stuck somewhere in between. This is less a problem than it sounds, though, because, lampoon or not, Jackson and Reynolds are good together.\n\nReynolds plays Bryce, a former CIA agent specializing in offering first-class (\"Triple A rated\") protection for corporate clients who feel their lives might be in danger. In an opening scene, we meet him in flashback, giving the deluxe treatment to a Japanese businessman. He and his team escort the gentleman to the tarmac and see that he is safely boarded onto his private jet. And then just as they are all congratulating themselves for a job well done, the businessman is assassinated through the window of the plane.\n\nThis is what passes for slapstick in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" -- assassination as punchline. If you don't think you could possibly consider that funny, this fine cinematic exercise is not for you.\n\nAnyway, two years later, Bryce needs a shave; his love life is non-existent and his once top-flight business is a shadow of itself. Then one day he gets a phone call from his estranged ex-girlfriend, an Interpol agent played by the French actress Elodie Yung: She needs him to escort a notorious hit man (Jackson, of course) to The Hague, where he is to testify against a really, really horrible war criminal (Gary Oldman, of course). The only catch is that there are many dozens of heavily armed criminals and corrupt Interpol agents who want to make sure that this testimony never happens.\n\nDoes this story have a certain familiar rin? The last time somebody made this movie it was called \"Hot Pursuit,\" with Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara -- essentially a road trip comedy about a pair of opposites, whose slowly blossoming friendship keeps getting interrupted by violent interludes. That movie collapsed into total discord, but \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" finds a tonal universe in which the violence and the comedy are not in conflict. Then again, perhaps the tone didn't really have to be arrived at. Perhaps the tone was just a given, something that was automatically built in from the moment Samuel Jackson appeared on the set.\n\nAside from the principals, who are everything they should be, there is Oldman, who is appropriately repellent in a couple of key scenes; and Elodie Yung, who makes a nice impression of strength and purpose as the Interpol agent. In a sense, Oldman and Yung play dramatic characters in the midst of a comedy, but the filmmakers weave them into the flow. Meanwhile, Salma Hayek stands out in a comic role as the hitman's impossibly vulgar, assertive wife.\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are lots of car chases here, and they actually aren't boring. That qualifies as a rare achievement.\n\nAction comedy. Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds. Directed by Patrick Hughes.

Jackson, who does his best to top even his Tarantino-films use of the m-word, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is a blunt, ultraviolent, obnoxious empty vessel of a movie.\n\nReynolds plays Bryce, a formerly \"Triple-A Rated\" elite security specialist who has fallen on hard times. Jackson is Darius Kincaid, a legendary assassin with well over 150 kills, now behind bars.\n\nThrough a series of contrived and deadly circumstances, Bryce's ex, the Interpol agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung), enlists him to transport Darius from Great Britain to The Hague, where the Belarusian war criminal Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) is on trial.\n\nYou see, Darius is the only witness with actual evidence against the murderous Dukhovich. And he's cooperating with authorities in exchange for the release of his wife (Salma Hayek), a horrible person with little or no redeeming qualities.\n\nSo off we go on this \"Midnight Run\" knockoff, and time and again the comedy is tone-deaf and tired.\n\n* Two battered and bloody tough guys hitch a ride with a busload of nuns in uniform. Gee, think we'll get a sing-along?\n\n* Nearly every major character in this film has a moment where he or she laughs forever, in that overwrought way only movie characters ever laugh.\n\n* Reynolds sings Ace of Base's \"The Sign\" in a piercing falsetto to drown out Jackson. No thanks.\n\n* We get multiple jokes about rear ends -- the sight of a butt, the smell of a butt, putting things in butts. I mean, come on.\n\nThis stuff is as stale and moldy as that half-finished bag of bagels you forgot to throw out before leaving for a three-week vacation.\n\nThough set in the present day, Hughes' European-set would-be thriller has the look and feel of a second-tier buddy movie from the 1980s or the 1990s.\n\nThe two talented leads, playing the obligatory enemies thrust together and forced to trust one another, exchange insults and quips between (and sometimes during) shootouts and car chases, barely pausing to take a breath after taking out henchman after henchman after henchman -- and showing no regard for the hundreds upon hundreds of innocent motorists and pedestrians put at risk every time another blood-spilling confrontation breaks out in broad daylight.\n\nIn one particularly ludicrous and borderline offensive scene, Reynolds' character is at an outdoor caf\u00e9 in Amsterdam, complaining to the bartender about Jackson. As gunshots ring out and vehicles are overturned and innocent people scramble for safety, Reynolds just keeps on whining -- not even turning around for the longest time.\n\nWhat a jerk. Even though \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is clearly intended to be a hard-R cartoon, I say the scene is borderline offensive because there's something seriously callous and cruel about Reynolds' self-pitying monologue, given he's a skilled gunman and fighter, and innocent people could well be dying directly behind him.\n\nThere's nothing and no one to like in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard.\" This is one loud, generic, forgettable late summer action flick.\n\n\u26051/2\n\nSummit Entertainment presents a film directed by Patrick Hughes and written by Tom O'Connor.

His career gets nuked when he loses a high-profile client and is consigned to looking after coked out lawyers such as Seifert (a fun but brief cameo from Richard E Grant).\n\nMeanwhile evil President of Belarus, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) is busy committing genocide and killing off all witnesses who might testify against him. Except that is for ultra hitman Darius Kincaid (Jackson), who has dirt on Dukhovich and thus needs to be protected en-route to give evidence at The Hague, from Manchester in the UK.\n\nCue some mildly entertaining but 'seen it all before' assassination attempts, car chases and lots of banter. One of the problems is the low rent setting for the first major action scene. The streets of Coventry are just really hard to make look cool even when you have a small army of tooled up mercs trying to kill Kincaid. It looks for all the world like one of them might pop in a Tesco Express and grab a sandwich mid battle.\n\nAs the predictable plot ticks along, there are love interests on hand in the form of Bryce's ex-lover Amelia (the excellent Elodie Yung), a CIA agent who blackmails him into protecting Kincaid in the first place. Speaking of whom, Kincaid's wife Sonia (Salma Hayek) is locked up and is being used to persuade him to testify in order for her to be released.\n\nThere is one funny flashback of how Mr and Mrs Kincaid met but otherwise it's a case of lazy swearing rather than actually funny lines. Couple this with action which wouldn't look out of place in a bargain bin DVD and this is massive missed opportunity.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is averagely entertaining.

Jackson is the assassin he's supposed to protect in the action comedy 'The Hitman's Bodyguard.' Lionsgate\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is the comfort food of action comedies, like mac and cheese with a side of extreme violence.\n\nChock-full of familiarity, the middling buddy film (** out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Friday) is a rather basic mash-up of what made its two A-list stars famous. Even sans Deadpool mask, Ryan Reynolds is aces at cracking wise, and Samuel L. Jackson continues to be masterful with the melding of \"mother\" and another not-so-family-friendly word. The combination of the two showcases fun chemistry and antics, although surrounded by a formulaic narrative that action junkies have all seen before.\n\nDirected by Patrick Hughes (The Expendables 3), the film features Reynolds as Michael Bryce, a high-profile bodyguard in London whose \"AAA rating\" -- like a five-star Yelp score for those in protection services -- plummets after a client gets murdered.\n\nMore: Assassins and hitmen line up to make a killing at the movies\n\nHe's still blaming his ex, Interpol agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung), for the disastrous incident when she calls to ask for a life-or-death favor: Keep notorious hitman Darius Kincaid (Jackson) alive and deliver him to the International Criminal Court so he can testify against Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman), a brutal Belarusian dictator on trial for murder and ethnic cleansing.\n\nAnybody who's seen 48 Hrs., Lethal Weapon and their ilk can fill in the blanks from here: Kincaid and Bryce don't get along at first, learn how to play nice, and by the end are saving each other's bacon. Bryce is more babysitter than bodyguard for Kincaid, a seriously formidable killer with righteous leanings, but the way they bond over Bryce's rendition of Ace of Base's The Sign and Kincaid's endless affirmations (\"When life gives you [stuff], you make Kool-Aid\") keeps the plot moving in between sundry shoot-'em-ups and car chases.\n\nReynolds is at least solid playing exasperated straight man to Jackson's singing, cursing assassin, though this is the latter actor's movie to own. Whether stealing a boat or wooing a bus full of nuns, Jackson is the most watchable aspect of this entire affair, and the screenplay makes the most of his reputation by giving him plenty of opportunities to utter his favorite cinematic profanity.\n\nSalma Hayek also seems to be having a blast swearing up a storm as Kincaid's jailed spouse Sonia, whose freedom is negotiated by the hitman in exchange for his testimony. More unfortunate is Oldman's talent being wasted on a one-dimensional Eastern European supervillain, a nasty piece of work who only gets one real chance to let loose.\n\nRelated: Female stunt driver dies on the set of 'Deadpool 2'\n\nThe movie slightly hints at some intriguing real-world themes, though there's a terrorist incident that's so jarring, it takes the viewer out of the movie's overall frivolity. The action sequences on the whole are well directed but overly drawn out, though a throwdown in a hardware store between Reynolds and a buff evil goon nails the Looney Tunes-y feel that marks the project's best scenes.\n\nFor Reynolds and especially Jackson completists, The Hitman's Bodyguard has something to offer even if the action flick can't completely find its aim.\n\n1

It recycles vintage character types, tropes and politics and already feels like the kind of movie you might half-watch on TNT on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nDirected by \"The Expendables 3\" director Patrick Hughes with a script by Tom O'Connor that could have been written in 2005, \"Hitman's Bodyguard\" is a film that lives and dies on its stars. Samuel L. Jackson, as the hit man, and Ryan Reynolds, as the bodyguard, both working within their already well-established personas, make for a fine pair of unlikely partners and hit a few well-placed punchlines with expert delivery. Jackson, in particular, is a treat to watch, whether singing Italian folk songs with nuns or doling out love advice via speakerphone during a car chase.\n\nThe plot concerns testimony that the hit man, Darius Kincaid (Jackson), is supposed to give against a bloodthirsty Belarusian dictator, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). In exchange for the release of his feisty wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek) from a Dutch prison (it's never explained why she's in prison), Kincaid promises to offer proof of Dukhovich's war crimes.\n\nWhen the Interpol transfer of Kincaid goes south, agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) calls up an old boyfriend for backup. He's Michael Bryce (Reynolds), an \"executive security agent\" who has fallen on hard times. Bryce and Kincaid have a long and thorny history as adversaries, so their 24-hour jaunt from England to Amsterdam proves to be quite eventful. Thanks to Dukhovich's thugs, who are trying to prevent Kincaid from testifying, it's also packed with violence and action.\n\nThe film demonstrates a hypocritical attitude about murder. While Kincaid and Bryce race across town to indict a dictator for murdering civilians, they remorselessly leave a wake of bloody bodies in the streets. They're bad guys, but the tricky morality doesn't quite gel.\n\nMoreover, the violence of \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is thuddingly, exhaustingly dull. It's not shot in any particularly interesting way, the cinematic geography is mush, and the stunts and action choreography are nothing to write home about. As the film pushes the two-hour mark, it just becomes a boring blur.\n\nAnd speaking of blur, Hughes shoots every scene with open windows providing backlight, creating a gauzy haze throughout the whole film. It makes no sense why every scene looks like the lens has been smeared with Vaseline. It doesn't even soften the edges of the brutally bad CGI.\n\nThe problem with \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" aside from the dodgy filmmaking craft, is that this story is the least interesting tale one could tell about these characters. The flashbacks, to Kincaid's first kill and his meet-cute with Sonia, are juicy snippets of stories that would have made for a better movie. This film should have traded the hit man's bodyguard for his wife. She's the most compelling character in it.\n\n'The Hitman's Bodyguard'\n\nTwo stars\n\nout of four stars\n\nRated R; violence, language\n\n1 hour, 58 minutes\n\nOpens wide Friday; some screenings Thursday\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2uSSP0X", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "166"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99729"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302901", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302958", "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307334", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309008", "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309120", "label": {"eng": "Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309129", "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309197", "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_(decade)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "312332", "label": {"eng": "2000s (decade)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315280", "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322968", "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330000", "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_O'Connor_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "423663", "label": {"eng": "Tom O'Connor (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_2#Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "462530", "label": {"eng": "The Expendables 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_cute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "543083", "label": {"eng": "Meet cute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lodie_Yung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "745907", "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lodie Yung"}}]}

Jackson, who mobilizes his favorite four-letter weapon over and over again, wins hands down.\n\nAre we ready, already, for \"Deadpool 2\" (the real thing isn't due until next year)? The armed and dangerous character Ryan Reynolds plays in the action-comedy \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is a lot like the Marvel superhero Reynolds rode to success in 2016's first \"Deadpool.\"\n\nHis latest role is motor-mouthed bodyguard Michael Bryce, with superhero-level fighting and shooting skills. He's at work in England when we first meet him, and in a humiliating scene, his client, weightily named Kurosawa (Tsuwayuki Saotome) by screenwriter Tom O'Connor (whose only previous credit is 2012's \"Fire with Fire\"), is assassinated before Michael's eyes by an unknown sniper.\n\nCut to two years later, Michael is a wreck. He and his Interpol agent girlfriend Amelia (Elodie Yung, \"Gods of Egypt\") have split. He's driving a beater car that smells like rump and taking bathroom breaks inside it using a plastic bottle. His latest client is an attorney (Richard E. Grant) flying on cocaine and rightfully terrified of being killed.\n\nWhen Amelia is ordered to find someone \"off the grid\" to protect Darius Kincaid (Jackson), the key witness in a Hague war criminal trial of genocidal Belarus leader Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) in the Netherlands, Michael and Darius embark upon a super-violent bromantic countdown road-trip adventure. Darius has agreed to testify in order to get his beloved and equally tough wife, Sonia (an amusing Salma Hayek), released from prison and pardoned.\n\nThe film is better than what I had expected from Patrick Hughes, a director whose previous credits includes \"The Expendables 3.\" \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" rather obviously borrows bits from \"The Transporter\" films, which are better than anyone in my profession cares to admit, the \"Bourne\" movies, with their exotic locations and signature shootout and chase scenes, and good old Bond films.\n\nBut it does so with a lot of humor and even some aplomb, although \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" goes on way too long. The shootouts are cut too much to follow, and the film's soundtrack is abusively loud. Jackson and Reynolds have fun chemistry as the wise-cracking surrogate father-and-son fighting team.\n\nYung gives the token \"girl\" role soul and character. You half expect Oldman's Dukhovich to spout bat wings and flutter away Vlad Dracul-style. In the supporting cast, Joaquim de Almeida is solid in the sort of role \"Bourne\" film fans will recognize.\n\nAs an American variation on one of those \"Kingsman\" films, this \"Bodyguard\" is not half bad.

These are the doldrums. The summer, as a movie season at least, is effectively over, and the fall hasn't started yet. Perhaps for that reason, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" seems just a little better than it really is.\n\nFor the record, it's a pleasing action movie that aspires to be something more, but doesn't quite achieve its intention. But it really is pleasing and better than routine, and it has a way of topping itself. So if, after about 80 minutes, you think the movie is offering you its big climax, that it's giving you all it's got, it's not. It goes on to catch a second wind and gets bigger and wilder and even more satisfying.\n\nThe movie also is a chance to appreciate Samuel L. Jackson in something close to his purest form. Other movies, after all, have other reasons for being. There are roles to be cast and actors to play them. But it's hard to imagine any reason for this movie's existing but for the fact that Jackson was willing to be in it. It's impossible even to imagine it even making sense without the menacing joviality that he brings to it -- and also his history with the audience, our shared feeling of knowing this actor and of being in on his particular comic wavelength.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" pairs Jackson here with Ryan Reynolds, and sprinkled throughout we get moments that suggest an attempt -- by Tom O'Connor's screenplay and Patrick Hughes' direction -- to turn the movie into a buddy action-comedy. But O'Connor and Hughes' aren't quite sure whether they're making a buddy action-comedy or lampooning the genre, and so their attempt is stuck somewhere in between. This is less a problem than it sounds, though, because, lampoon or not, Jackson and Reynolds are good together.\n\nReynolds plays Bryce, a former CIA agent specializing in offering first-class (\"Triple A rated\") protection for corporate clients who feel their lives might be in danger. In an opening scene, we meet him in flashback, giving the deluxe treatment to a Japanese businessman. He and his team escort the gentleman to the tarmac and see that he is safely boarded onto his private jet. And then just as they are all congratulating themselves for a job well done, the businessman is assassinated through the window of the plane.\n\nThis is what passes for slapstick in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" -- assassination as punchline. If you don't think you could possibly consider that funny, this fine cinematic exercise is not for you.\n\nAnyway, two years later, Bryce needs a shave; his love life is non-existent and his once top-flight business is a shadow of itself. Then one day he gets a phone call from his estranged ex-girlfriend, an Interpol agent played by the French actress Elodie Yung: She needs him to escort a notorious hit man (Jackson, of course) to The Hague, where he is to testify against a really, really horrible war criminal (Gary Oldman, of course). The only catch is that there are many dozens of heavily armed criminals and corrupt Interpol agents who want to make sure that this testimony never happens.\n\nDoes this story have a certain familiar ring? The last time somebody made this movie it was called \"Hot Pursuit,\" with Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara -- essentially a road trip comedy about a pair of opposites, whose slowly blossoming friendship keeps getting interrupted by violent interludes. That movie collapsed into total discord, but \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" finds a tonal universe in which the violence and the comedy are not in conflict. Then again, perhaps the tone didn't really have to be arrived at. Perhaps the tone was just a given, something that was automatically built in from the moment Jackson appeared on the set.\n\nAside from the principals, who are everything they should be, there is Oldman, who is appropriately repellent in a couple of key scenes; and Yung, who makes a nice impression of strength and purpose as the Interpol agent. In a sense, Oldman and Yung play dramatic characters in the midst of a comedy, but the filmmakers weave them into the flow. Meanwhile, Salma Hayek stands out in a comic role as the hitman's impossibly vulgar, assertive wife.\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are lots of car chases here, and they actually aren't boring.

Jackson irritating, watching - or perhaps it would be better to say enduring - this film must be about as enjoyable as being punched in the face.\n\nFor those who can't stand both, it must feel like the sort of experience that you could only recover from with the help of a patient therapist and a lifetime supply of clozapine.\n\nThe story begins with the assassination of a Japanese businessmen through the window of his private jet, to the shock and professional horror of 'triple-A rated executive protection agent' Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds), who had, until that point, done a bang-up job of keeping him safe. (That might, on reflection, have been the wrong adjective to use).\n\nAt any rate, a year later Bryce has stubble, which is cinematic language for being either washed-up or French, and I think we can probably eliminate the second option.\n\nThanks to our troublesome mystery assassin, Bryce has lost his triple-A rating but is nevertheless as competent as he ever was.\n\nMeanwhile bloodthirsty dictator Vladislav Dukhovich, (played by the always-brilliant Gary Oldman, who is presumably in the film for ironic reasons) is on trial for assorted war crimes committed in Belarus which, we're helpfully told, is a 'former Soviet Union' country, and therefore implied to be a swirling vortex of nihilism, lawlessness and goat stew.\n\nThe success of Dukhovich's trial for all that indiscriminate slaughter rests on the shoulders of an elite hitman named Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson, Jr.), who is to be taken to the International Court of Justice in The Hague by a specialist protection team in an effort to prevent or foil any attempts at an intervention by Dukhovich's killing squads.\n\nNeedless to say things don't quite go according to plan, and Amelia Ryder, an Interpol agent and one of the only surviving members of the fragmented protection detail, calls on a former flame to finish the job and get Kincaid to The Hague. Accordingly, our bodyguard comes to find himself protecting our hitman.\n\nAs I suggested in my opening remarks, the degree to which you enjoy The Hitman's Bodyguard will rest in a large part on how fond you are of its principal players. (I am, at best, ambivalent about the both of them (although Ryan Reynolds has been in my good books, so to say, since his appearance in the brilliant Deadpool).\n\nAs a result I can't help but feel that handing over the usual sum of money to see this film would have felt pretty bloody expensive.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is fundamentally a buddy cop flick, only without the cops, or what the great Roger Ebert used to call a 'Wunza' movie, as in 'One's a ..., the other's a ...' These films invariably go the same way: they include a good deal of reluctant cooperation and verbal sparring between the two main characters and usually end with an understanding that both the main characters actually quite like each other.\n\nHow lovely.\n\nThe film is notable for including a lot of what you might call Europe porn, given the vast majority of the action takes place in London and Amsterdam.\n\nHughes and cinematographer Jules O'Loughlin treat us to a variety of landscapes and cityscapes of Belarus, the Netherlands and the UK. (Fortunately we're still told if the scene takes place in, say, Amsterdam, because the gratuitous shots of flowers, canals, prostitutes and signs in Dutch might otherwise lead you to think it was Stockport).\n\nIt would be unfair to say that there aren't a few genuine laughs in The Hitman's Bodyguard - a scene on a bus full of nuns might just force a laugh out of even the most composed filmgoer - and the action scenes are well-choreographed and well-executed by O'Loughlin.\n\nThere's more than one thrilling chase sequence that I'd probably remember even more fondly if Baby Driver wasn't so fresh in my memory, although the sequences in The Hitman's Bodyguard do run to a breathtakingly unoriginal stock action score. There are decent enough supporting performances by a foul-mouthed Salma Hayek, who plays Kincaid's incarcerated wife, and \u00c9lodie Yung, and there's an amusing cameo by Richard E. Grant early on in the film.\n\nThe question as to whether you should see this film could be resolved by a flow chart. Do you find Samuel L. Jackson and/or Ryan Reynolds annoying? If so, then don't see this film. If not, then, Do you like buddy cop films? If not, then don't see this film. If so, then, well, I mean, maybe.\n\nMORE: The Beguiled: A sexually-charged feminist retelling of a civil war psychodrama\n\nMORE: 47 Metres Down: Better than your average summer horror flick - though not by much", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Belarus"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Belarus"}, "type": "loc", "id": "35"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "166"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}, "type": "loc", "id": "97668"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99729"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305312", "label": {"eng": "Therapy"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309393", "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309735", "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "311558", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315280", "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321407", "label": {"eng": "Stew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "323658", "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "346257", "label": {"eng": "Post-Soviet states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "354849", "label": {"eng": "Roger Ebert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "355935", "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_cop_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "395386", "label": {"eng": "Buddy cop film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozapine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "459989", "label": {"eng": "Clozapine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "657568", "label": {"eng": "Richard E.

Jackson as his nemesis-turned-client Darius Kincaid -- a murderer-for-hire Michael must reluctantly protect while Darius prepares to testify against a Belarusian dictator accused of war crimes (Gary Oldman) -- the comic action/buddy flick serves up an undistinguished bill of fare.\n\nFor plot, there's a bloody yet hard-to-swallow cut of subprime red meat: \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is gratuitously violent and preposterous. For acting, there's not one but two cheese-stuffed baked potatoes on the plate, with Jackson and Reynolds vying for the audience's attention. In place of fresh, crisp dialogue, there's a wilted word salad of vulgar repartee, the most common utterance of which -- this being a Samuel L. Jackson film -- is unprintable.\n\nAt other times, Darius' put-downs are simply head-scratching: \"I've eaten hamburgers that know more about women than you,\" he tells Michael, during one of several man-to-man talks about woman troubles that they manage to squeeze in between escapades eluding assassins on the way to The Hague's International Criminal Court.\n\nTo be sure, there is always a certain pleasure in watching Jackson do his thing: Glare, grin and then unload with a mouthful of invective, followed by a can of whup-ass. The same does not apply to Salma Hayek, who plays Dariuss foulmouthed convict wife, Sonia.

Only one fight scene - between Michael and Dukhovich's henchman Ivan (Yuri Kolokolnikov), who move from restaurant kitchen to hardware store, availing themselves of a hot grill and a nail gun for weapons - approaches the inspired level of a live-action comic book like, say, \"John Wick.\"\n\nDespite all the mayhem, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is a surprisingly bland dish.

Co-starring Ryan Reynolds as Michael Bryce, a disgraced security expert seeking redemption, and Samuel L. Jackson as his nemesis-turned-client Darius Kincaid - a murderer-for-hire Michael must reluctantly protect while Darius prepares to testify against a Belarusian dictator accused of war crimes (Gary Oldman)- the comic action/buddy flick serves up an undistinguished bill of fare.\n\nFor plot, there's a bloody yet hard-to-swallow cut of subprime red meat: \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is gratuitously violent and preposterous. For acting, there's not one but two cheese-stuffed baked potatoes on the plate, with Jackson and Reynolds vying for the audience's attention. In place of fresh, crisp dialogue, there's a wilted word salad of vulgar repartee, the most common utterance of which - this being a Samuel L. Jackson film - is unprintable.\n\nAt other times, Darius' put-downs are simply head-scratching: \"I've eaten hamburgers that know more about women than you,\" he tells Michael, during one of several man-to-man talks about woman troubles that they manage to squeeze in between escapades eluding assassins on the way to The Hague's International Criminal Court.\n\nTo be sure, there is always a certain pleasure in watching Jackson do his thing: Glare, grin and then unload with a mouthful of invective, followed by a can of whup-ass. The same does not apply to Salma Hayek, who plays Dariuss foulmouthed convict wife, Sonia. Promised release from prison if Darius agrees to help put Oldman's Vladislav Dukhovich behind bars, Sonia has little to do except curse loudly and in Spanish (yet not especially colorfully, according to the subtitles).

Samuel's character is being protected by Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds' bodyguard, and the two are involved in various incidents en route in the action comedy.\n\nThe Avengers star told the news outlet the movie will appeal to film fans who want to see people on screen that look \"more like them\".\n\n\"Superhero movies are superhero movies, they're fine, but people like seeing ordinary people do extraordinary things or enjoy their lives the way they might enjoy them, and they can relate to them in a very honest and real kind of way,\" he stated.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard began hitting screens from 10 August.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television_and_Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 350, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television and Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 577, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News and Media"}], "concepts": []}

This summer has offered an array of fun spectacles, smart blockbusters, and thoughtful smaller films, producing one of the better summer movie seasons in some time. Too bad we have to end on a sour note.\n\nRyan Reynolds stars as Michael Bryce, a former \"Triple-A Rated\" elite security specialist, who falls from self-proclaimed greatness when one of his clients is murdered aboard a plane. Everyone around him scrambles to assess the situation; Bryce just stares in awe at his departed client without ever moving. Maybe he wasn't as good at his job as he likes to think.\n\nTwo years later, Bryce is broken down and dispirited. He still works as a bodyguard but not for anyone he puts any form of importance upon. His ex-girlfriend, Interpol Agent Amelia (Elodie Yung), contacts him out of desperation with a job she needs done to make herself look good. Bryce hesitantly accepts, only to find out he has to transport infamous assassin Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) to The Hague to testify against a dictator named Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman).\n\nThe bulk of \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is watching the mismatched Bryce and Kincaid travel from Point A to Point B. They bicker and clash from the start. Bryce is too uptight for Kincaid, demanding seatbelts and general safety, and Kincaid usually retorts with something that starts with motherf\u00e2\u0080\u015awell, you probably get the picture. Their journey has a staggering body count, which causes most of the movie to feel numbing and repetitive.\n\nWhat plagues director Patrick Hughes' action-comedy extravaganza is its pervasive blandness and overwhelming sense of been there, done that. Reynolds is effortlessly charismatic and no one plays foul-mouthed, off-the-charts like Jackson but together they are just asked to be their personas, not characters. In between the melee, the characters reflect upon life and love, with Kincaid hoping to break his wife (Selma Hayek) out of jail. It's all an effort to provide shading to these thinly sketched caricatures but it doesn't quite work.\n\nScreenwriter Tom O'Connor has built a story upon contrivances with the hopes the gunfire and blood splatter would be enough to entertain audiences. Just shy of two hours, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" feels like an eternity with its prolonged action sequences and monologues about love. It's a shame that the individual charms of Reynolds and Jackson couldn't provide much of a spark among the explosions because the movie feels warmed-over from the very beginning.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Computer_Graphics", "wgt": 100, "id": 1025, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Computer Graphics"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}, "type": "loc", "id": "97668"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309393", "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309735", "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatter_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "408155", "label": {"eng": "Splatter film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_O'Connor_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "423663", "label": {"eng": "Tom O'Connor (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}]}

Classics like 48 Hours, Lethal Weapon, Midnight Run and Rush Hour spawned sequels and franchises, pitting two mismatched \"partners\" with each other to reach a common goal. These days, they aren't nearly as common as they once were, which is why Lionsgate's The Hitman's Bodyguard almost feels like a throwback to a bygone era, with two of today's most charismatic actors, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson pitted against each other. While the action and the chemistry between these stars most certainly works, my enjoyment of the movie was often hampered by a story that's even more derivative than the trailers present.\n\nWhat I was also surprised by was the rather intense level of action here, with some truly thrilling set pieces that I wasn't really expecting. That's one of the benefits of setting this up as an action-comedy, though. You have to sell the dynamic between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, that you can leave your juiciest set pieces behind without shortchanging the fans. They're basically telling you: come for Deadpool vs. Nick Fury (I wonder if Lionsgate would get sued for trying that...) but stay for some crazy action set pieces. Director Patrick Hughes, in just his third feature film (The Expendables 3, Red Hill) shows that he has the chops to handle both the action and the break-neck dialogue exchanges between two actors who most certainly have the so-called \"gift of gab.\"\n\nJust for the dialogue exchanges and the scope of the story alone, I'm not at all surprised that the script from writer Tom O'Connor (Fire With Fire) made the Black List in 2011, and the writer certainly keeps the audience on their toes with plenty of surprises along the way. When the first Hitman's Bodyguard trailer debuted in April, the video was partially set to Whitney Houston's iconic song from The Bodyguard, which is certainly humorous on one level, given the nature of this story. The plot centers on Michael Brice (Ryan Reynolds) reluctantly agreeing to protect the man who has tried to kill him and his clients for many years, Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson), since Kincaid is now the only man who can testify against a nefarious dictator, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) and his war crimes, and, of course, there's only a certain amount of time left for Kincaid to testify, or Dukhovich walks free.\n\nWhile The Bodyguard trope was certainly trotted out for fun, the script, in a lot of places, comes off as trope piecemeal. There is the \"reluctant partners on the run\" thing from Rush Hour, The Rundown and lesser-known fare like Bulletproof and the highly-underrated Skiptrace (it's on Netflix, check it out). The whole race against the clock to testify in time thing reminded me a lot of 16 Blocks and the whole hitchhiking with church folks thing reminded me of... something... Borat, maybe? I don't know, the point is, there were a different parts of the movie that got my trope Spidey sense tingling, because it felt so familiar. Still, with that being said, there is not that same level of familiarity with the dialogue, which is very fresh and raucously hilarious at times. I also wasn't too big of a fan of Elodie Yung's performance as Amelia Roussel, the Interpol agent (and Brice's ex-lover) who gets Brice to protect his worst enemy. They're whole back story feels like it has too much weight and I wasn't really into it, but Kincaid's back story is peppered with fascinating tidbits that all pay off in fascinating ways. Also there is a great supporting turn from Salma Hayek as Darius' foul-mouthed wife, Sonia Kincaid, who is not one to be trifled with.\n\nThis movie had been in development for quite some time, with Pierre Morel once attached back in 2012, less than a year after Tom O'Connor's script surfaced on the Black List. However, after all those years, Tom O'Connor still has sole writing credit, which is certainly a testament to the script itself. Anything that can manage to endure throughout the grind known as development hell, where countless writers are often brought on along the way, and come out with only the original writer's name on the movie, is truly impressive, since it doesn't happen terribly often (ex. Passengers). Still, its derivative tropes aside, The Hitman's Bodyguard is just one hell of a good time, providing plenty of action and the multi-talented stylings of Ryan Reynolds and Sam Jackson, the perfect comedy duo for these troubling times, who can not only make us laugh, but kick some ass while doing so.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 559, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 959, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Screenwriting", "wgt": 100, "id": 1403, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Screenwriting"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303484", "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304250", "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306293", "label": {"eng": "Trope (literature)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309393", "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "311558", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Houston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314801", "label": {"eng": "Whitney Houston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "327085", "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "349435", "label": {"eng": "Nick Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "366352", "label": {"eng": "Development hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_Weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "379212", "label": {"eng": "Lethal Weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "410776", "label": {"eng": "Borat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_O'Connor_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "423663", "label": {"eng": "Tom O'Connor (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_2#Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "462530", "label": {"eng": "The Expendables 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bodyguard_(1992_film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "471305", "label": {"eng": "The Bodyguard (1992 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man's_powers_and_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "531728", "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man's powers and equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Blocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "602621", "label": {"eng": "16 Blocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Morel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "816144", "label": {"eng": "Pierre Morel"}}]}

It relies on the chemistry (or anti-chemistry, if you will) of stars Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, who thankfully know their way around a delicious line delivery.\n\nTogether, Reynolds and Jackson give \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" just enough rock 'em sock 'em punch to make it work. But you still might need an ice pack on your head by the time the credits roll.\n\nReynolds, in full uptight sarcastic mode, plays Michael Bryce, a protection agent who brags about his Triple-A rating like that guy in the bar who won't shut up about the touchdown he scored in the big game in high school. Jackson, in full expletive-laden motormouth mode, is deadly assassin Darius Kincaid, who has 250 kills to his credit.\n\nThey reluctantly team up when Bryce is tasked with delivering Kincaid to international court in Amsterdam to testify against a vicious warlord (Gary Oldman). Seemingly hundreds of bad guys are dispensed of along the way.\n\nDirector Patrick Hughes (\"The Expendables 3\") layers the film with wall-to-wall action and old-school macho bravado. But writer Tom O'Connor's script has an unexpected romantic undercurrent, as both Bryce and Kincaid are trying to make things right with the women in their lives (\u00c9lodie Yung and a terrifically foulmouthed Salma Hayek, respectively).\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" comes at you hard, but skates by on its charms.

There's a bromance and several love stories all wrapped up in this incredible, crazy action story.\"\n\nAdds Jackson: \"Ryan and I go on a crazy fun jaunt through the roads of Europe - and it's full of chaos and humor between two characters who have a very unusual chemistry.\"\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is rated", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 100, "id": 244, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "wgt": 100, "id": 245, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100, "id": 540, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100, "id": 974, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100, "id": 1179, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Magazines_and_E-zines", "wgt": 100, "id": 1619, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Magazines and E-zines"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309008", "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309735", "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314759", "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "332398", "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "335511", "label": {"eng": "Bromance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "350729", "label": {"eng": "Order of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_de_Almeida", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "377695", "label": {"eng": "Joaquim de Almeida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_2#Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "462530", "label": {"eng": "The Expendables 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "657568", "label": {"eng": "Richard E.

Jackson) in The Hitman's Bodyguard.\n\nIf so, there's nothing remotely plausible or naturalistic about The Hitman's Bodyguard. It's a bloody, goofy movie that plays like a parody of an '80s buddy action movie -- it's like Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours on human growth hormone, minus the actorly bits. It gives us Samuel L. Jackson playing an oversized, shorthand version of his familiar screen persona and Ryan Reynolds as his foil, a high-dollar security professional who's a kind of ethnically Canadian James Bond. (Ten percent less exotic than Pierce Brosnan with an infusion of kittenish cuteness!)\n\nLondon-based Michael Bryce (Reynolds) is Felix Unger fastidious, a careful man in a dangerous profession who had never lost a client until someone pulled off a lucky shot and nailed a Japanese arms dealer Bryce was contracted to protect. This blip cost Bryce his \"triple-A\" rating, his Jaguar and his sleek Black Mirror-worthy residence in the English countryside. It also cost him his girlfriend, Interpol agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung).\n\nBryce suspected Amelia leaked some information about his client, and to be fair, Interpol as depicted here is a pretty loose shop. Amelia is now charged with transporting notorious international hit man Darius Kincaid (Jackson) to The Hague so that he can testify in the war crimes trial of brutal Belarusian strongman Vladislav Dukhovich (who else but Gary Oldman?). For some reason, there's a hard deadline on the trial -- Kincaid has to appear in court within 48 hours or else Dukhovich goes free.\n\nSince it's about a six-hour drive from London to The Hague via the Channel Tunnel (or about a half hour by air) you'd think it'd be no problem to get the witness to the dock on time. But Dukhovich has a mole inside Interpol (no spoiler here, but the rat's identity is revealed early on) and a virtual army of mercenaries with seemingly limitless resources on the ground. So it's only luck and Kincaid's lethal resourcefulness that allows them to escape an ambush.\n\nHoled up in a safe house, unsure of who to trust, Amelia calls on her ex-lover -- who, the face of his cherished Patek Phillippe cracked, is reduced to baby-sitting coked-up shysters (Richard E. Grant makes a brief but very funny appearance).\n\nAfter the usual bitter ex-lovers' banter, Bryce agrees to help, only to discover that the man she wants him to protect is his bitterest enemy. Kincaid has attempted to kill Bryce at least 28 times -- or maybe he's attempted to kill Bryce's clients 28 times. (Which means that while Kincaid may have dispatched 250 or so targets, he's not perfect.)\n\nAfter the predictable getting-to-know-you squabble, Bryce sets off with a handcuffed Kincaid on a circuitous lap around England for the purpose of evading the bad guys who seem to know their every move. Inevitably things get so desperate that Kincaid picks up a weapon and the two make common cause, spilling blood and crashing vehicles along the way.\n\nWhen they get to Amsterdam, we learn that Bryce -- who we thought was reduced to living in his car -- maintains a rather well-equipped apartment there. And we get to see a lot of that enchanting city's canals and the Rijksmuseum playing an Interpol prison.\n\nThere's a lot of fun to be had if you don't think too hard about things. About the only ethical question it ponders is whether it's worse to kill evil folks or to protect them. (Substitute Jackson's favorite compound noun for \"folks\" and you'll get the flavor of the argument.) Director Patrick Hughes doesn't attempt anything too audacious, banking on the considerable talents of the cast to elicit empathy. Reynolds and Jackson settle into a pleasant pocket with their bickering, and if they never reach the heights achieved by Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin in 1988's Midnight Run, every once in a while their repartee approaches genuine wittiness.\n\nThe violence is all loud and painless in the modern way, more likely to exhaust than upset. And while a pair of romantic subplots feel a little pasted on, one of them is redeemed by Salma Hayek's marvelously profane turn.\n\nThere aren't many surprises other than, considering that Tom O'Connor's script was among the top 2011 Black List of unproduced screenplays, the writing is a little pedestrian. The Hitman's Bodyguard is a very good example of a certain kind of overt Hollywood project that reassures the audience with its familiarity. We know the beats the characters will hit, and there's something satisfying when they hit them.\n\nIn another time this would pass as an enjoyable B-movie, a low-pressure programmer that asks little of its audience other than a couple of hours of their summertime leisure. It's less complicated and dark than a Shane Black buddy comedy, the computer-assisted graphics are a little obvious and overdone, and the whole enterprise feels juvenile when compared to last month's Atomic Blonde (which also put an '80s pop soundtrack to better use).\n\nBut what do you want in a mid-August actioner? The Hitman's Bodyguard succeeds as a travelogue, a European getaway fantasy in the middle of the dog days.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41,

Are movie stars enough to sell a breathlessly rewritten paste-up job?\n\nSo it is with \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" which is not a musical but is, according to reports, a breathlessly rewritten paste-up job. Once Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson agreed to star in this thing, about a fastidious bodyguard assigned to an \"unkillable\" hired assassin traveling from England to The Hague to testify against a brutal dictator, a straight-up action picture became a crooked sort of action comedy, massively violent but full of wisecracks in between the head shots.\n\nThe result is passable stupidity leaning hard on its wily leading men. The movie's also pretty galling in its unceasing brutality for laughs. Right now some of us may find ourselves disinclined to see a movie like \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" with terrorist attacks as sight gags and bodies flying all over London and Manchester and Amsterdam and points in between. (There's a considerably better diversion with a little less blood on its mind, \"Logan Lucky,\" also opening this week.)\n\nAfter a fatally botched job, \"executive protection agent\" Michael Bryce (Reynolds) finds himself scrounging for work. His ex-lover, an Interpol agent (Elodie Yung), guilts him into accompanying Darius Kincaid (Jackson) from a Manchester prison to The Hague to testify against the dictator. Meanwhile wave upon wave of Belarusian thugs in league with their murderous former president (Gary Oldman) attempt to kill, and kill again. Let the insults beginning or ending with Jackson screaming \"m-----f-----\" commence!\n\nThe bodyguard and his hit man have a weird history together, which screenwriter Tom O'Connor details in flashbacks recalling the worst of Guy Ritchie's movies, where the visual footnotes and hyperlinked jumps back in time play like lazy storytelling rather than clever or surprising reveals. Salma Hayek, who usually slums it more effectively in roles and movies like these, overacts like a fiend as Darius' imprisoned wife, who goes free once her husband testifies.\n\nDirector Patrick Hughes (\"The Expendables 3\") manages one enjoyably frantic Amsterdam chase sequence, with Jackson and his busy stunt double speedboating along the canals while Reynolds (and his stunt man) zooms up and down streets on his motorcycle, with Belarusian thugs in hapless pursuit. The ultraviolence (faces held against hot griddles, etc.) I can do without; I don't care if \"that's how action is these days.\" Tellingly, the best laugh in the picture is a bit involving an aborted getaway and a couple of air bags, not a drop of fake blood or cartoonish digital effects.\n\nAt one point Oldman decries the \"ludicrous charade\" of his criminal trial, and the actor pronounces \"ludicrous\" with six or seven u's, i.e., \"luuuuuuuudicrous.\" With that one vowel sound, a bored actor earns his paycheck. The movie persistently blinds the audience with flare-intensive, cheap-looking digital lensing by Jules O'Laughlin.\n\nNo matter; the film will likely make its money. In a recent interview with Vice, Jackson said he and Reynolds told the filmmakers: \"If people get out of the way and let us do what we do, we can fix f---ed-up s--- that's on the page, and they'll look like superstars.\" This is how things are today. The better and more ambitious the writing becomes on the small screen, in every genre, the more things stay the same at the multiplex.\n\nMichael Phillips is a Chicago Tribune critic.\n\nmjphillips@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @phillipstribune\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" -- 2 stars\n\nMPAA rating: R (for strong violence and language throughout)\n\nRunning time: 1:58\n\nOpens: Thursday evening\n\nRELATED: From 2016, Michael Phillips Chicago Tribune review of \"Deadpool\" \"\n\nTribune review of \"Kong: Skull Island\" co-starring Samuel L.

Jackson and still winds up mostly firing blanks. A bloody buddy movie, the action-comedy puts its stars' appeal to the test, as they bicker and blast their way through Europe in roughly that order.\n\nThere's an old-school quality to the formula, but the execution quickly yields diminishing returns. Despite the occasional burst of silliness, it's a pallid version not only of the leads' past roles, but prior odd-couple pairings like \"48 Hrs.\" or \"Midnight Run.\"\n\nIn that spirit, the paper-thin plot unfolds against the deadline of a ticking clock, which casts Jackson as Darius Kincaid, a notorious hitman. He's in the custody of Interpol, which has 27 hours to transport him from England to The Hague in the Netherlands, where he's scheduled to testify against a ruthless dictator (Gary Oldman, at half-speed by his bad-guy standards) who stands accused of war crimes.\n\nAfter the first of many, many gun battles (all waged at a decibel level set on \"deafening\"), an Interpol agent (\"Daredevil's\" Elodie Yung) recruits her former boyfriend, Michael Bryce (Reynolds), to get Kincaid to the court on time. Bryce is a private-security specialist who has hit a rough patch, and he has some history with his new charge, so much so that at first glance the two try to kill each other.\n\nMuch bantering, colorful cursing (it's Samuel L. Jackson, after all) and chases involving the aforementioned dictator's disposable minions follow, along with modest crumbs about our heroes' respective pasts. In Kincaid's case, for example, he's cooperating with authorities to win the release of his wife (Salma Hayek), who, rather adorably, is every bit as foul-mouthed, ill-tempered and violent as her hubby.\n\nReynolds has a knack for mixing mayhem with smart-alecky ripostes, but as constituted here it at best feels like \"Deadpool\" lite. Ditto for Jackson, in a weak variation of his Quentin Tarantino roles, as director Patrick Hughes never quite gets a handle on the tone as the movie oscillates between grisly violence and smirk-y throwaway lines.\n\nThe result is thus neither fish nor fowl, and too chaotic and episodic (argue, fight, repeat) to even serve as an enticing European travelogue. While it goes without saying that the hitman and his reluctant protector will forge a grudging bond, the two run out of fresh insults and schoolyard taunts long before they exhaust their supply of bullets.\n\nOne of the recurring gags pivots on Kincaid's survival skills -- a guy so hard to kill that his wife refers to him as a cockroach. The abundant explosions notwithstanding, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" gradually feels as if it, too, is just sort of crawling along, until you start to wish that somebody would step on it.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" opens in the U.S. on Aug. 18.

He found all sorts of acclaim for his turn in Deadpool, a passion project of his for years now. That's launched the already successful star into the stratosphere, with bigger things set to come his way. This week, Reynolds goes the action comedy route with The Hitman's Bodyguard, pairing him with the one and only Samuel L. Jackson in the process. More important than this somewhat disposable seeming flick is the fact that, post Deadpool, Reynolds is finally the A-lister that Hollywood was always trying to make him into.\n\nThis film is, as mentioned above, an action comedy. Reynolds stars as Michael Bryce, the world's top bodyguard. After a high profile embarrassment puts his career in jeopardy, he's given a shot at redemption when a job protecting a hit man named Darius Kincaid (Jackson) comes along. Kincaid is about to testify before the Hague in regards to the crimes of Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). Suffice to say, he wants Kincaid never to make it to the International Court of Justice. It's up to Bryce to make sure it happens. The mismatched pair must stay alive if Dukhovich will be brought to justice, not to mention make sure that Kincaid's wife Sonia (Salma Hayek) is protected. Patrick Hughes directs a script by Tom O'Connor here. In addition to the aforementioned cast, the movie also includes Richard E. Grant and Elodie Yung, among others.\n\nPre Deadpool, Reynolds was sort of pigeonholed as a romantic comedy leading man. He certainly has the charisma for it, but he has more edge than that, so they never quite fit him like the glove Hollywood had hoped for. There were also action hero roles, but blander ones that mostly wasted him (cough, Green Lantern, cough). His best work was when he could be serious, in things like Adventureland, Buried, and Mississippi Grind. Easily three of his top performances, they show him stretching and inhabiting characters in a way that served him well when the Merc with a Mouth came along and finally got the green light last year.\n\nPost Deadpool, Reynolds is now a Golden Globe nominee and as big an A-lister as ever. His offbeat superhero flick damn near scored an Academy Award nomination in the process. That's something. Not only does he have the Deadpool sequel in production right now, but he took on a nice little supporting part in this summer's science fiction outing Life. He's seemingly being a bit pickier than he's previously been, and that's a very good thing. With the ability to have more say in the roles, better ones will come his way. Deadpool 2 should just be the tip of the proverbial iceberg for the actor.\n\nHere is how I would rank Reynolds' ten best performances to date:\n\n10. Buying the Cow\n\n9. National Lampoon's Van Wilder\n\n8. Woman in Gold\n\n7. Paper Man\n\n6. Definitely, Maybe\n\n5. The Nines\n\n4. Adventureland\n\n3. Mississippi Grind\n\n2. Deadpool\n\n1. Buried\n\nHonorable Mention: Chaos Theory, The Proposal, and Waiting...\n\nTomorrow, audiences can see Reynolds do what he's grown to do so well in The Hitman's Bodyguard. If the film doesn't appear to be anything special, both Reynolds and Jackson are in their comfort zones. Going forward, it will be fascinating to see what Reynolds does with his newfound clout. There will be more Deadpool adventures, obviously, but also likely some further shots are serious acclaim. Personally, I think he's capable of getting nominated for an Oscar. More work like Buried or Mississippi Grind will put him into contention, without question. I'll be watching closely, and you should be as well...\n\nBe sure to check out Reynolds in The Hitman's Bodyguard, opening everywhere this weekend!", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100, "id": 974, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "311558", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool#Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270178", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (film)"}}]}

Jackson and Ryan Reynolds find creative ways to dispatch a host of extras in the excessively mayhem-ridden action flick \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" (Summit).\n\nSome dialogue justifying revenge -- and flirting with blasphemy -- only reinforces the general disregard for life underlying the proceedings.\n\nJackson plays paid assassin Darius Kincaid. Unlikely as it seems, Kincaid has become the key witness in the international human rights trial of murderous Belarusian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (scenery-chewing Gary Oldman). But, as an early ambush scene demonstrates, Interpol is not up to the task of protecting Kincaid as he makes his way from a prison in Manchester, England, to The Hague to testify.\n\nSo, while on the lam with Kincaid after the sneak attack, Interpol agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) turns to Michael Bryce (Reynolds), a once highly regarded but now down-on-his-luck security specialist -- who also happens to be her ex-boyfriend -- to shield her charge. What she fails to reckon on is the fact that the gunman and his proposed guardian are old and bitter enemies.\n\nKincaid mouths off and Bryce fumes as their mutual aversion inevitably blossoms into a bromance.

One can't help but mourn how little The Hitman's Bodyguard tries when even just a few sparks of inspiration could have elevated it to something special. Even the title is desperately unimaginative.\n\nThirty years ago, a movie like this would have arrived with a title like Cruel Target or Maximum Weapon. They probably would have found someone a little more grizzled for the white-guy character; The Hitman's Bodyguard has Ryan Reynolds. He's supposed to be a world-weary \"executive protection agent\" who's lost his girlfriend and his career after a botched job, but whenever he grimaces -- which he does a lot, provoked either by feelings or bullets -- he merely looks bummed, like a guy who just woke up after a frat party with dicks drawn on his face.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson, on the other hand, is fun (if not exactly credible) as an assassin who's slated to testify in international court against a Belarusian dictator (Gary Oldman). Reynolds is assigned to get Jackson from Manchester to the Hague, as Oldman's henchman and Interpol agents try and stop them. The European backdrop is a welcome twist on this very American recipe, although it ends up basically being a non-element.\n\nJackson and Reynolds' banter gets better as the movie goes along, and the action sequences, while by and large unintelligible, gain a certain over-the-top momentum; the best one depicts a speedboat-motorcycle-car chase along a canal in Amsterdam. And Salma Hayek makes the most of her role as Jackson's jailbird wife, even if all she is required to do is swear loudly and extravagantly.\n\nYou'll probably enjoy The Hitman's Bodyguard just fine when you stumble across it on TV during a rainy Saturday. (The movie might even be funnier if its curse-strewn dialogue gets bleeped for basic cable.) It's not a bad movie. It's just there, like food, waiting to be ingested, processed, crapped out, and forgotten about.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television_and_Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 350, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television and Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 100, "id": 758, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86277"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}, "type": "loc", "id": "97668"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99729"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302913", "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309735", "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "311558", "label": {"eng": "Deadpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312587", "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cheesecake_Factory", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "334674", "label": {"eng": "The Cheesecake Factory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1023879", "label": {"eng": "The Hitman"}}]}

And it's juvenile tone might actually connect with a young male demo that used to go to the movies, but lately has gone down the rabbit hole of poop-posting (that's my polite translation of the technical term) and meme-spreading. I read about some of them in while seeking to understand events at Charlottesville, a search that led me to an Southern Poverty Law Center explainer on the flag of Kekistan, flown on Saturday by a few alt-right marchers. Apparently it's the facetious symbol of a facetious nation whose ostensible purpose is to troll literal-minded media-types. Hilarious, except the young woman and two policeman killed in Charlottesville are not facetiously dead. (Nevertheless, somewhere a giggling dweeb is high-fiving himself).\n\nThis is an online culture I don't pretend to understand, beyond it's deliberately slippery relationship with irony, and its net-fueled amplification of the adolescent male's fascination with chaos for its own sake. But in benign terms, these are young people with way too much time on their hands.\n\nI direct their attention to Hitman's Bodyguard, an ultra-violent screwball Odd Couple featuring Ryan Reynolds (he does have a little Felix Unger in him) as the button-downed security professional hired to protect a notorious assassin (Samuel L. Jackson) on his way to testify at The Hague against a murderous dictator (Gary Oldman).\n\nOf course the two are mismatched opposites -- white and black, young and old, digital and analogue, perfectionist planner and improvisational disruptor, etc. And of course they become buddies. It's an obvious formula, but when the movie sticks to it, it works well enough; Reynolds and Jackson have pretty decent chemistry.\n\nAs for Patrick Hughes' direction, it's every bit as good as it was in The Expendables 3. Sometimes he forgets he's making a comedy, and the whimsical slaughter of the movie's massively long roster of henchmen can turn heavy-handed and rather ugly.\n\nThe highlight is Reynolds facing off with the baddest of the bad in a hardware store, using the tools available to him (though I still prefer the Denzel Washington/Antoine Fuqua original, seen in The Equalizer).\n\nAlso, you can't go to this movie if you have a low-tolerance for the F-word and its many variations. Jackson is an acknowledged maestro, but it's actually Salma Hayek who makes the biggest effing impression in this regard -- she's cast as Jackson's imprisoned ex-wife, pretty and petite yet improbably the baddest con in the joint.\n\nAfter nearly two hours, Reynolds and Jackson join hands and arise from the table of brotherhood to perforate the forehead of a neo-fascist with a nail gun. The crowd goes wild. Will it play in Kekistan? Surely. They're known, after all, for their sense of humor.\n\nMovies Hitman's Bodyguard Directed by Patrick Hughes. With Samuel. L.

Jackson and Ryan Reynolds go on a lame, violent Eurotrip in 'The Hitman's Bodyguard'", "uri": "711063814", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-17T19:07:00Z", "time": "19:07:00", "body": "After stumbling out of \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" an insanely violent live-action cartoon starring Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds, I found myself asking the kind of question the critic is occasionally forced to ponder after too many years steeped in Hollywood movies. No, not, \"Why didn't I take off the month of August?\" or \"Why don't fights like that ever break out at my local hardware store?\" A question of a more technical nature: Is it \"hitman\" or \"hit man\"?\n\nLionsgate's posters declare the former; the all-knowing Associated Press Stylebook, alas, dictates the latter. This is hardly the first time the decision makers of Hollywood and the copy editors of America have had to agree to disagree, as my memories of the epic hyphenation battles over \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" attest. In the case of \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" the studio's preferred one-word spelling may actually be the appropriate one, given the hectic, dizzying speed of the movie in question. Space? It doesn't have time for a space; it barely slows down for punctuation.\n\nThe hit -- er, the assassin is Darius Kincaid, played by Jackson with his usual diabolical grin and his unrivaled comic mastery of everyone's favorite 12-letter expletive. Held in a Manchester, England, prison, he agrees to testify against a genocidal Belarusian dictator named Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman, chewing the scenery as if it were a nice stuffed bulbianiki) in exchange for the release of his also-incarcerated wife (Salma Hayek, having more fun than the rest of us). And so begins a race to get Kincaid from Manchester to The Hague, a journey all but paved with nasty Dukhovich henchmen bent on taking him out before he can reach the witness stand.\n\nAfter a brutal street ambush that leaves several Interpol operatives dead and the camera lens splattered with blood, one surviving agent, Amelia (\u00c9lodie Yung, fine in a thankless role), decides the only one who can get Kincaid to safety is her estranged ex-boyfriend. That would be the bodyguard, Michael Bryce (Reynolds), who was once a top-of-the-line, Triple A-rated protection agent before he lost a high-profile Japanese customer (briefly played by Tsuwayaki Saotome) by the name of Kurosawa, which I guess makes Bryce his yojimbo.\n\nStuck in a downward spiral ever since, Bryce has a shot at career redemption if he can complete this \"Midnight Run\"-style mission, which he reluctantly accepts after he and Kincaid have made some obligatory attempts to destroy each other (acrimonious job history and all that). On paper, the talent match-up would seem inspired: Even before his career-making work in \"Deadpool,\" Reynolds was always a dab hand with a one-liner, the rare leading man with an insult comic's sensibility. And Jackson is, well, Jackson. Give the two of them some guns and shove 'em in a soon-to-be-totaled car, and the brawling and bickering should more or less write itself.\n\nNot quite, alas. Uncertain whether to be a cheerfully weightless killing spree, an earnest odd-couple comedy or, most hilariously, a straight-faced Eastern European political thriller, Tom O'Connor's screenplay falls back on shopworn snark and half-baked bromantic attitudes. If it would shock you to hear that the merry contract killer teaches the uptight bodyguard a thing or two about how to chill out and get his woman back, by all means proceed to the nearest multiplex. The rest of you may wish to avoid the painful spectacle of two gifted comic actors looking far more stranded than they should -- sometimes getting by on their well-practiced shtick, but other times flailing to conjure hilarity out of nothing.\n\nAustralian director Patrick Hughes previously made the third and worst movie in \"The Expendables\" franchise, though in that case he was hamstrung by a self-defeating PG-13 rating. Liberated here by a well-earned R, he stages a few clunky but serviceable action scenes, the best of which is a high-speed chase involving a runaway boat, an airborne motorcycle and lots and lots of weaponized cars. Elsewhere the director wipes out an outdoor market and blows up a public building, in scenes that probably would have been a bit (but only a bit) less troubling to watch a week ago.\n\nLighten up, you may say. But even those who try to lose themselves in the meager, mindless thrills of \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" may be distracted, if not by the looming specter of current events, then at least by the movie's technical shoddiness. Scene after scene is marked by a glaring discontinuity between background and foreground, and there's one helicopter explosion that has a visual quality I don't have the word for at the moment, though I will once I've consulted the stylebook. Should \"craptastic\" be hyphenated?\n\n------------\n\n'The Hitman's Bodyguard'\n\nRating: R, for strong violence and language throughout\n\nRunning time: 1 hour, 58 minutes\n\nPlaying: In general

Taking the most common of monosyllables, he created a new idiom: swearing as impromptu recitation. For a while now, Samuel L. Jackson has done something similar for the F bomb's maternal counterpart. He gathers up the four syllables of the Oedipal obscenity and, as the mood takes him, deploys them as punctuation, emphasis, punch line, verbal default, you name it.\n\nJackson has many moods in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard.\" You'd expect nothing less from the world's deadliest hit man, Jackson's character. Wanting to spring his wife from an Amsterdam prison (Salma Hayek plays the wife, and wouldn't you want to double date with that couple?), he agrees to testify at the International Court of Justice against a Belarus bad guy (Gary Oldman, inevitably).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a problem. Seemingly half of the male population of Belarus have Uzis and are out to keep Jackson, currently under arrest in Manchester, England, from getting to the Netherlands. Enter Ryan Reynolds as a down-on-his-luck protection agent. \"Let's focus on dying of natural causes,\" he reminds an unruly client. \"Boring is always best.\"\n\nBoring? Best? Samuel L. Jackson? You can see where this is going. Patrick Hughes's previous directing credit was \"The Expendables 3,\" so you can really see where this is going. \"My job is to keep you out of harm's way,\" Reynolds warns Jackson. \"I am harm's way,\" Jackson warns back.\n\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nEven by the junk-food standards of summer action comedies, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is overlong, over-violent, and over the top. By the time of the fourth smash-crash-bash set piece -- Manchester gets one, Amsterdam another, and the Hague, that world capital of international cooperation, endures two -- \"Downton Abbey\" reruns are looking better and better.\n\nEven worse is an intermittent tonal problem. It's not coarseness. That's to be expected. Remember, Reynolds starred in \"Deadpool.\" It's not even having a villain who commits atrocities. Unless it's garish, movie villainy hardly registers anymore. No, it's showing the villain committing the atrocities (admittedly, the worst instance we only see in photographs).\n\nIt takes a lot of Samuel L. Jackson to compensate for something like that, and compensate he does. This is a man who can get an audience to erupt with laughter simply by saying \"Please\" -- and that's without a four-syllable word fore or aft. Dry and sardonic, Reynolds has the good sense mostly to play straight man. We do get to hear him do a Jackson imitation. It's not bad. Jackson waits until the very end of the movie to top that, with a Macaulay Culkin imitation -- yes, you read that right -- and it's a . . . oh, never mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nTHE HITMAN'S BODYGUARD\n\nDirected by Patrick Hughes.

At least it manages to be sort of amusing. Ryan Reynolds plays the Robert De Niro role, only instead of being a prickly, Sinatra-belting bail bondsman and former Chicago cop who's still hung up on his ex-wife, he's a finicky, Ace Of Base-yodeling bodyguard-for-hire and former CIA agent (aren't they all?) who's still hung up on his ex-girlfriend. We're introduced to him living in one of those glass modernist shoeboxes that all of today's elite big-screen gunmen seem to live in, until one pesky sniper round to a tycoon's forehead downgrades him to babysitting drug-addled fugitive bankers. The Charles Grodin role -- at least narratively, since the character dynamics are reversed -- is in turn filled by Samuel L. Jackson, whose character isn't a mob accountant with a five-day bond forfeiture deadline in Los Angeles, but a world-class contract killer who has less than 24 hours to get to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\n\nReynolds' Michael Bryce picks Jackson's character, Kincaid, up from a safe house in London, called in by the aforementioned ex, an Interpol agent named Amelie Roussel (Elodie Yung). She's run out of ideas after being ambushed by the henchmen of the guy Kincaid is supposed to testify against, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman, with bifocals and Jeff Bridges hair), the fictional dictator of the very real country of Belarus. (Let's just say that the script presumes viewer ignorance in subjects of geography, geopolitics, etc.) The testimony is part of a deal to free Kincaid's ferocious wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek), and... yada yada yada. Like basically every genre movie that makes its way through today's Hollywood production machine, The Hitman's Bodyguard has about five times as much backstory as it needs, as if getting shot at weren't enough motivation. But Reynolds and Jackson have a very good onscreen rapport, with the former playing the high-strung and smug foil to the latter's unflappable, no-remorse asshole. Kincaid and Bryce have some history together -- enough to try to kill each other the moment they meet in the safe house -- but it doesn't have much bearing on the characterizations. They're two wise-asses -- wise-asses who are just like the other wise-assses the actors have played before -- stuck together on a road trip in a series of stolen compact cars, ribbing each other and telling stories that Hughes illustrates as stylized, grindhouse-grainy, slow-motion flashbacks.\n\nOr at least that's what it's like whenever The Hitman's Bodyguard isn't pulling out another breathlessly uninvolving action sequence. Again and again, the stars' stunt doubles rip vehicular mayhem through what direct-to-video action buffs will undoubtedly recognize as the forests of western Bulgaria. Hughes really can't visualize fast, coordinated action in distinct images (his style is \"coverage of stunts from different angles\"), and it mixes poorly with the film's crappy special effects. There's a shockingly gruesome fight between Bryce and a Dukhovich goon in a Dutch hardware store that's composited to look like a single take, but instead of something like the grisly long take in David Leitch's recent Atomic Blonde, it comes out as a series of choppy close-ups that have been impatiently glued together. Studio-backed productions have less variety than ever, so it's not uncommon to watch a movie where almost everyone involved seems like they wish they were working on something else. That's all too true here -- from Jules O'Loughlin's overcompensating, thickly diffused cinematography to Atli \u00d6rvarsson's busy, spy-movie score. Hughes shows a surprising ease with visual gags and punchlines, especially in the movie's more clearly organized first act; perhaps he's wasting his time as an action journeyman. In fact, the only ones who seem to be truly enjoying themselves are Jackson and Reynolds -- even during the boring parts where they have to talk about their feelings.", "date": "2017-08-17",

Running time: 111 minutes. Rated R (profanity, violence, disturbing images).\n\n'Why are we always yelling?\" Ryan Reynolds says to Samuel L. Jackson in a rare, passably funny moment in \"The Hitman's Bodyguard.\"\n\nI have a few additional questions: Why did either of you gentlemen sign up for this tone-deaf piece of work? Who thought it was appropriate to use mass graves as a plot point in an action comedy?\n\nAnd did someone get Vaseline on the camera lens? Because half the time the background seems to be out of focus.\n\nIt's the rare movie that can squander the substantial talents of all four stars: along with the generally likable Jackson and Reynolds, the chief baddie here is played by Gary Oldman in scary mode, which he does quite well, and Salma Hayek portrays Jackson's wife, increasingly coming into her own careerwise as a total badass.\n\nBut there's an inherent ugliness to \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" that undercuts them all.\n\nThe plot sees Michael (Reynolds), an elite private security guard disgraced after letting a client die, tasked with transporting Darius (Jackson), an incarcerated assassin, to the Hague to testify. Darius has dirt on the sinister president of Belarus (Oldman), whose goons will stop at nothing to kill the informant before he makes it there.\n\nDirector Patrick Hughes previously helmed the third installment of \"The Expendables,\" which also seems to be how he regards non-A-listers in his cast. Violently and casually murdered extras are a depressing staple of today's action fare, but \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" really seems to revel in explosively bloody shots to the head, scoring gunfights with a bombastic chorus of male voices chanting \"Hoo! Ha!\" Which would be laughable if the whole thing weren't so mean-spirited.\n\nInterspersed with the gore is banter between the leads, who fall into a predictable odd-couple pairing of fussy (Reynolds) and gonzo (Jackson).

Jackson riff and rumble in a nimble, old-school action-comedy.\n\nIs any major movie star more gleefully unpretentious an entertainer than Samuel L. \"Motherfuckin'\" Jackson? Whether getting chomped in half by a biochemically-engineered, super-intelligent shark, or growling a heap of mess at Django, he glides across genres and periods with the winning insouciance of a professional who knows exactly what he's here to do.\n\nThere will be yelling. There will be cursing, if the ratings board allows. And there will be cackling at somebody's ass. Sam's got this worked out to a science.\n\nIn The Hitman's Bodyguard (\u2605\u2605\u2605), Jackson's formula gets spiked with a potent hit of Ryan Reynolds, another king of Hollywood nonchalance. Having appeared in 2012's Safe House as Matt Weston, a skilled, ambitious CIA agent, assigned to protect a dangerous international criminal, while also looking out for his French-speaking girlfriend, Reynolds switches it up here as Michael Bryce, a skilled, ambitious executive security agent, assigned to protect a dangerous international criminal, while also looking out for his French-speaking girlfriend.\n\nThis safe house is in London, not Cape Town, and instead of Denzel Washington, he's protecting Darius Kincaid (Jackson), not an ex-super spy but a present-day super-assassin. Bodyguard Bryce has to get the hitman from the safe house to the International Court in the Hague to testify against Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman), a brutal Belarusian dictator. Will they make it in the nick of time?\n\nWhatever the tweaks to the formula, the chemistry is mostly right, catalyzed by writer Tom O'Connor's cheeky dialogue, and sharp direction by Patrick Hughes, who broke into blockbuster territory with The Expendables 3.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard shares with that guns-and-pecs-fueled franchise an abiding affinity for big, bruising '80s-style action. Our heroes never meet a problem that can't be solved with a gun, a bigger gun, an explosion, or a pithy comeback. As Bryce and Kincaid beat a steady, wisecracking path across the continent, with Interpol and Dukhovich's men hot on their tails, they flip cars, blast through and blow up countless Belarusian henchmen, and even make time to bare their feelings about ethics and romance.\n\nKincaid's not a bad guy, you see. He's a hitman with a moral code and true love in his heart. He lives for his badass wife, Sonia, played for all she's worth by Salma Hayek, who is every bit Jackson's match when it comes to spitting streams of expletives with concussive force and musicality. Plus, she does it in two languages. Separated on-camera for much of the running time, Jackson and Hayek nail Darius and Sonia's simpatico spirits. They're a couple who seem made for each other, and their long-distance romance provides compelling underscore for the film's laugh-out-loud comedy and outrageous action. Bryce and Kincaid fight their way out of many tight skirmishes, including one breathtaking clash with a gang of goons in a galley kitchen. The stunt work is impressive, if a little too obviously faked on occasion, and Hughes keeps the energy pulsing.\n\nBut whereas the chases by boat, motorcycle, or beat-up hatchback zig-zag with moments of genuine surprise, the story offers few such hints of originality, and subtlety is not a strong suit. In predictable fashion, an orange-tinted spray-tan signals a character's insincerity, a lingering clench of a shoulder signals another's villainy.\n\nThe film feints at real-world commentary by zeroing in on a recognizably unhinged despot as its main villain, but The Hitman's Bodyguard is no twisty, Bourne-ian take on geo-politics. It's a straightforward, crowd-pleaser, well-executed by professionals who know what they're here to do.\n\nFirst among them, Oldman might or might not speak Russian with a ridiculous accent, but he's as committed to harassing frightened villagers and ordering around his enforcers as if he were playing King Lear. Richard E. Grant also gets in on the scenery-chewing fun in a brief turn as a coked-up security client, and, as the French-speaking Interpol agent girlfriend, Elodie Yung at least gets to take out her share of bad guys.\n\nEveryone appears to be working in the proper mode of not taking the globe-hopping adventure too seriously. While the picture doesn't necessarily stick the landing, it does add richly to Jackson's lexicon of quotable lines and catchphrases, and it's unrelentingly entertaining the whole time.", "date":

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" unleashes a double-barreled shot of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson and still winds up mostly firing blanks. A bloody buddy movie, the action-comedy puts its stars' appeal to the test, as they bicker and blast their way through Europe in roughly that order.\n\nThere's an old-school quality to the formula, but the execution quickly yields diminishing returns. Despite the occasional burst of silliness, it's a pallid version not only of the leads' past roles, but prior odd-couple pairings like \"48 Hrs.\" or \"Midnight Run.\"In that spirit, the paper-thin plot unfolds against the deadline of a ticking clock, which casts Jackson as Darius Kincaid, a notorious hitman. He's in the custody of Interpol, which has 27 hours to transport him from England to The Hague in the Netherlands, where he's scheduled to testify against a ruthless dictator (Gary Oldman, at half-speed by his bad-guy standards) who stands accused of war crimes.After the first of many, many gun battles (all waged at a decibel level set on \"deafening\"), an Interpol agent (\"Daredevil's\" Elodie Yung) recruits her former boyfriend, Michael Bryce (Reynolds), to get Kincaid to the court on time. Bryce is a private-security specialist who has hit a rough patch, and he has some history with his new charge, so much so that at first glance the two try to kill each other.Much bantering, colorful cursing (it's Samuel L. Jackson, after all) and chases involving the aforementioned dictator's disposable minions follow, along with modest crumbs about our heroes' respective pasts. In Kincaid's case, for example, he's cooperating with authorities to win the release of his wife (Salma Hayek), who, rather adorably, is every bit as foul-mouthed, ill-tempered and violent as her hubby.Read MoreReynolds has a knack for mixing mayhem with smart-alecky ripostes, but as constituted here it at best feels like \"Deadpool\" lite. Ditto for Jackson, in a weak variation of his Quentin Tarantino roles, as director Patrick Hughes never quite gets a handle on the tone as the movie oscillates between grisly violence and smirk-y throwaway lines.The result is thus neither fish nor fowl, and too chaotic and episodic (argue, fight, repeat) to even serve as an enticing European travelogue.

Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L Jackson, Gary Oldman, Elodie Yung, Salma Hayek, Joaquim de Almeida, Tine Joustra. Director: Patrick Hughes.\n\nReleased: August 17 (UK & Ireland)\n\nIn 1992, Whitney Houston fell head over stiletto heels for her po-faced protector, Kevin Costner, in the blockbuster thriller The Bodyguard.\n\nA quarter of a century later, the heady musk of bromance pervades as Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reynolds wedge tongues firmly in cheek to play the targeted prey and gung-ho guardian in Patrick Hughes' high-octane action comedy.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is a fitfully entertaining, testosterone-saturated romp that borrows the basic premise of the 1977 Clint Eastwood thriller The Gauntlet and orchestrates mayhem around the fractious on-screen chemistry of its two leads.\n\nTom O'Connor's freewheeling script falls short of the filth and irreverence of Deadpool, and action sequences aren't as stylish as that comic book caper, but the cocktail of obscenities, bawdy humour and cartoon violence slips down smoothly.\n\nReynolds and Jackson relish the potty-mouthed dialogue, but it's co-star Salma Hayek who sinks her painted talons deepest into every scene.\n\nShe is a delirious delight as the latter man's snarling, sex-charged wife, who makes her entrance by severing a carotid artery with a beer bottle and spits choice expletives from her perfectly glossed lips with gusto.\n\nShe perfectly embodies the film's outlandish, knockabout spirit.\n\nA bodyguard for hire is only as good as his last job.\n\nMichael Bryce (Reynolds) is one of the best protection agents in the business with a cautious, methodical approach to his work.\n\n\"Boring is always best,\" he instructs his team.\n\nAn anonymous sniper takes out one of Michael's prized clients. He loses his triple A rating and is relegated to shadowing low-value assets.\n\nOut of the blue, he is contacted by his old flame, Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung).\n\nShe is an Interpol agent, who should be shepherding hitman Darius Kincaid (Jackson) to The Hague, where he is due to testify against East European dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman).\n\nInstead, she is hiding in a safe house with Darius in the aftermath of an assault on the transportation cavalcade, initiated by Dukhovich's gun-toting henchmen.\n\nThe breach in security convinces Amelia that there must be a mole in a team led by Renata Casoria (Tine Joustra) and Jean Foucher (Joaquim de Almeida).\n\nShe needs someone \"out of the loop\" to shadow Darius to the International Court of Justice.\n\nMichael reluctantly agrees.\n\nEn route, the two men bicker and Darius teaches Michael how to win back Amelia by reminiscing about his courtship of jailbird wife Sonia (Hayek).\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard ricochets between European locations as the high stakes game of catch-me-if-you-can results in wanton carnage.\n\nA high speed chase around the canals of Amsterdam is orchestrated at a breathless pace, while Oldman's pantomime villain hungrily chews scenery.\n\nThe identity of the Interpol traitor will come as no surprise, but brawn easily smothers brains in O'Connor's loopy, crowd-pleasing script.", "date":

It's a bloody, goofy movie that plays like a parody of an '80s buddy action movie -- it's like Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours on human growth hormone, minus the actorly bits. It gives us Samuel L. Jackson playing an oversized, shorthand version of his familiar screen persona and Ryan Reynolds as his foil, a high-dollar security professional who's a kind of ethnically Canadian James Bond. (Ten percent less exotic than Pierce Brosnan with an infusion of kittenish cuteness!)\n\nLondon-based Michael Bryce (Reynolds) is Felix Unger fastidious, a careful man in a dangerous profession who had never lost a client until someone pulled off a lucky shot and nailed a Japanese arms dealer Bryce was contracted to protect. This blip cost Bryce his \"triple-A\" rating, his Jaguar and his sleek Black Mirror-worthy residence in the English countryside. It also cost him his girlfriend, Interpol agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung).\n\nBryce suspected Amelia leaked some information about his client, and to be fair, Interpol as depicted here is a pretty loose shop. Amelia is now charged with transporting notorious international hit man Darius Kincaid (Jackson) to The Hague so that he can testify in the war crimes trial of brutal Belarusian strongman Vladislav Dukhovich (who else but Gary Oldman?). For some reason, there's a hard deadline on the trial -- Kincaid has to appear in court within 48 hours or else Dukhovich goes free.\n\nSince it's about a six-hour drive from London to The Hague via the Channel Tunnel (or about a half hour by air) you'd think it'd be no problem to get the witness to the dock on time. But Dukhovich has a mole inside Interpol (no spoiler here, but the rat's identity is revealed early on) and a virtual army of mercenaries with seemingly limitless resources on the ground. So it's only luck and Kincaid's lethal resourcefulness that allows them to escape an ambush.\n\nHoled up in a safe house, unsure of who to trust, Amelia calls on her ex-lover -- who, the face of his cherished Patek Phillippe cracked, is reduced to baby-sitting coked-up shysters (Richard E. Grant makes a brief but very funny appearance).\n\nAfter the usual bitter ex-lovers' banter, Bryce agrees to help, only to discover that the man she wants him to protect is his bitterest enemy. Kincaid has attempted to kill Bryce at least 28 times -- or maybe he's attempted to kill Bryce's clients 28 times. (Which means that while Kincaid may have dispatched 250 or so targets, he's not perfect.)\n\nAfter the predictable getting-to-know-you squabble, Bryce sets off with a handcuffed Kincaid on a circuitous lap around England for the purpose of evading the bad guys who seem to know their every move. Inevitably things get so desperate that Kincaid picks up a weapon and the two make common cause, spilling blood and crashing vehicles along the way.\n\nWhen they get to Amsterdam, we learn that Bryce -- who we thought was reduced to living in his car -- maintains a rather well-equipped apartment there. And we get to see a lot of that enchanting city's canals and the Rijksmuseum playing an Interpol prison.\n\nThere's a lot of fun to be had if you don't think too hard about things. About the only ethical question it ponders is whether it's worse to kill evil folks or to protect them. (Substitute Jackson's favorite compound noun for \"folks\" and you'll get the flavor of the argument.) Director Patrick Hughes doesn't attempt anything too audacious, banking on the considerable talents of the cast to elicit empathy. Reynolds and Jackson settle into a pleasant pocket with their bickering, and if they never reach the heights achieved by Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin in 1988's Midnight Run, every once in a while their repartee approaches genuine wittiness.\n\nThe violence is all loud and painless in the modern way, more likely to exhaust than upset. And while a pair of romantic subplots feel a little pasted on, one of them is redeemed by Salma Hayek's marvelously profane turn.\n\nThere aren't many surprises other than, considering that Tom O'Connor's script was among the top 2011 Black List of unproduced screenplays, the writing is a little pedestrian. The Hitman's Bodyguard is a very good example of a certain kind of overt Hollywood project that reassures the audience with its familiarity. We know the beats the characters will hit, and there's something satisfying when they hit them.\n\nIn another time this would pass as an enjoyable B-movie, a low-pressure programmer that asks little of its audience other than a couple of hours of their summertime leisure. It's less complicated and dark than a Shane Black buddy comedy, the computer-assisted graphics are a little obvious and overdone, and the whole enterprise feels juvenile when compared to last month's Atomic Blonde (which also put an '80s pop soundtrack to better use).\n\nBut what do you want in a mid-August actioner? The Hitman's Bodyguard succeeds as a travelogue, a European getaway fantasy in the middle of the dog days.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41,

Professional killer-for-hire Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) needs bodyguard Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) to protect him from England to the Hague, where the hit man is set to testify against a Belorussian tyrant (Gary Oldman, doing everything he can with a boxed-in role). In exchange, Darius' wife, Sonia, will earn a get-out-of-jail-free card - she's played by Salma Hayek, who's almost excuse enough to see this movie. Her swearing is some kind of profane poetry. And boy, can she kick ass.\n\nDid we mention that Darius and Michael really hate each other? So there's that, plus tons of fights and car chases and boat chases to distract you from the recycled plot. The script by Tom O'Connor is a throwback to the glory days of Shane Black (The Last Boy Scout, The Long Kiss Goodnight and the immortal Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), but unfortunately, Black isn't around to do tune-ups. Patrick Hughes directs with all the originality and verve that you'd expect from the dude who gave us The Expendables 3. But all is not lost, not when Reynolds and Jackson are present and accounted for, constantly cracking wise. Can anyone wring more meaning out of the word \"motherfucker\" than Big Sam? It's a rhetorical question.\n\nAnd Reynolds may be doing his quips with the same sneer routine he deployed in Deadpool (minus the superhero drag), but it never gets old ... or at least it hasn't so far. Reynolds and Jackson make this summer lunacy go down easy with their banter and bullet-dodging skills.

They certainly inject a lot of life, humour and energy into the movie and a lot of their exchanges are fun to watch but the comedy is largely based on them yelling and swearing at each other, which does wear thin after a while.\n\nIt's hard to know why Oldman signed on for the movie as he gets barely anything to do, except in the finale. While Salma Hayek steals the show and proves her comedy chops as Sonia Kincaid, the over-the-top and foul-mouthed wife of Jackson's character.\n\nThe script is wildly inconsistent, so some parts fall totally flat while others are excellent. It is hard to know if some moments were deliberately bad to serve as a parody of the action genre or if they were just bad. For example, Michael and Amelia's love story was incredibly cheesy, with obvious music changes when things become romantic.\n\nThere are plenty of action sequences from car chases, hand-to-hand combat, and shootouts, and while these are pretty good, the CGI feels a little on the cheap side as there are some obvious green screen moments.\n\nAlthough it is very hit-and-miss, the leads elevate the so-so material, making the movie fun and entertaining to watch and producing a number of laugh-out-loud moments.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100, "id": 974, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}, "type": "loc", "id": "97668"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302913", "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303033"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304758", "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}, "type": "loc", "id": "305754"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306026", "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308256", "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309008", "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309120", "label": {"eng": "Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314759", "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "322968", "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "323658", "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-to-hand_combat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "325882", "label": {"eng": "Hand-to-hand combat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "328292", "label": {"eng": "Car chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "331409", "label": {"eng": "MSN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "332398", "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "613135", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bryce"}}]}

Jackson, Gary Oldman, Salma Hayek, Elodie Yung\n\nIf you heard a suspicious helicopter outside your house last spring, there is some small chance that the folk behind this bizarre action comedy were to blame.\n\nIt would not be true to say that half the film is taken up with aerial shots of European cities that offer generous tax breaks: London, Amsterdam, Manchester, the Hague, Coventry (no, really). It just feels that way. It feels as if the other half is taken up with good actors slumming their way through cliched variations on their most profitable personae.\n\nI'm afraid Salma Hayek actually does play a Mexican firecracker required to shout \"cucaracha!\" whenever the noise dies down. Samuel L Jackson is laboured with yet more bargain-basement sub-Tarantino comebacks. \"My job is to keep you out of harm's way,\" Ryan Reynolds says. \"Shut up, motherf**ker!\" Sam replies. \"I am harm's way!\" Yeah, I know it makes no sense, but we have to hurry on before the helicopter pilot loses the light. Essaying another racially stereotyped villain from an unreleased Charlie Chan movie (this one is Belarusian), Gary Oldman secures his hold on the Malcolm McDowell trophy for most squandered talent of his generation. No piece of scenery is left unchewed.\n\nReynolds comes off least badly in a film that certainly composes its clunky set-pieces on a grand scale. It's all there in the title. The sometime Deadpool plays a bodyguard who is required to deliver Jackson's hitman to a trial in The Hague. Twisting recent history to an offensive level, the script imagines General Oldmanski carrying out genocide in a civil war that never actually happened. Jackson is the one witness who can put him away.\n\nThe picture commits other, less distasteful mistakes that have been common in eurothrillers for decades. Once again, rather than being the document-shuffling bureaucracy it really is, Interpol becomes a global police force with the right to ignore national borders. The Hitman's Bodyguard almost compensates for such howlers with a series of elaborate action sequences that look to have cost squillions. (Pat yourself on your back if you know that the speedboat chase through the Dutch capital borrows forgivably from Dick Maas's excellent 1988 film Amsterdamned.)\n\nUnfortunately, the surrounding idiocy is too lazy and irritating to entirely forgive.

What sets it apart from other generic action films are the performances of its leads and also Salma Hayek. Rating: 3 stars out of 4.\n\nRight out of the gate, let's be clear: \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is not necessarily a good movie. \"Guilty pleasure\" is more like it.\n\nWith its countless hand-to-hand fight scenes, serial car chases full of explosions and bullet-perforated sheet metal, and nearly nonstop shootings (the blood-squib budget on this thing must have been sky high), \"Hitman\" is, in essence, a generic action picture.\n\nIts title is its plot. A down-on-his-luck professional protection agent (Ryan Reynolds) is assigned to deliver a killer (Samuel L. Jackson) to the International Criminal Court at The Hague to be a witness against a mass-murdering Slavic dictator (Gary Oldman, not trying very hard).\n\nStandard stuff. But it's got more humor and zest than most movies of its kind. And that makes it pretty darn enjoyable.\n\nWhat sets it apart are the performances of its leads and also Salma Hayek. These three seem to be enjoying themselves immensely, Jackson especially. He's playing perhaps the most Samuel L. Jackson character ever: intense, sardonic and effusively foulmouthed. His signature 12-letter cuss word falls from his lips with such frequency that Reynolds' character gets in a sly meta-dig, observing, \"this guy single-handedly ruined the word.\"\n\nHe's mocking his bodyguard. He's offering him unsolicited advice on the bodyguard's forlorn love life. He's laughing. He is, so help me, singing, often, once in a van full of cheery nuns, and also over the end credits. And he sounds pretty good.\n\nHe appears to be having the time of his life.\n\nSpouting that word as well is Salma Hayek, playing his wife, who delivers the epithet with ferocious gusto. Lie down with Sam, get up with a potty mouth.\n\nHer character is a real toughie, and their meet-cute moment is a flashback scene showing her winning a bar brawl while Jackson looks on in reverent, loving awe.\n\nReynolds is playing what amounts to the straight man to Jackson's bad boy, and the back-and-forth between the two, with his character stewing and steaming in exasperation at the killer's taunts, gives \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" its special fizz.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100, "id": 460, "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100, "id": 712, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Den Haag"}, "type": "loc", "id": "97668"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Hayek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "309178", "label": {"eng": "Salma Hayek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309393", "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "313405", "label": {"eng": "Kite (2014 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "318526", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "328292", "label": {"eng": "Car chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333345", "label": {"eng": "Gary Oldman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "334852", "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351987", "label": {"eng": "Sheet metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_credits", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "400979", "label": {"eng": "Closing credits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_cute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "543083", "label": {"eng": "Meet cute"}}]}

Jackson and Ryan Reynolds. This is not a movie with anything to say; it has no message, no raison d'\u00eatre.\n\nThis movie exists so that Samuel L. Jackson may yell and swear, so that Ryan Reynolds may retort with deadpan quips, so that vehicles may fly off of things and improbably continue operating, so that bad guys may be punched and worse.\n\nSo it's good. Because it is simple, and unambitious, and lighthearted.\n\nDarius Kincaid (Jackson), an international assassin facing life imprisonment at best, is offered a deal: His wife (Salma Hayek), currently in jail as an accomplice to his crimes, will be set free if he provides evidence against a despot (Gary Oldman) on trial for war crimes. Kincaid takes the deal, but Interpol has to deliver him from London to The Hague to make it work ... which is tricky, since Interpol has a bit of a mole infestation.\n\nAmelia Roussel (\u00c9lodie Yung), the quite-junior Interpol officer assigned to the task, gets Kincaid away from the dirty cops and delivers him to Michael Bryce (Reynolds), an old flame who just happens to be a disgraced former elite bodyguard. Kincaid and Bryce set out for Holland, at each other's throats when not evading gunfire.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a fine piece of modern cinema; it is very rough around the edges, with notably second-rate cinematography and sound, somewhat hapless direction (this is director Patrick Hughes' first film since \"The Expendables 3,\") and some repetitive bits.\n\nFortunately, the chemistry between the leads is great; Jackson returns to form here, and Reynolds remains at the height of his powers between \"Deadpool\" outings. Hayek is also quite funny, and Oldman is very comfortable as a glowering, spit-talking villain. And -- the big surprise -- unlike most of its action-comedy brethren, the set pieces are actually well above average; a chase scene through the streets of Amsterdam is particularly memorable.\n\nWill I be keeping it in mind when evaluating award contenders in a couple of months? Uhh, no. But you could do far worse than this. (Hollywood often does, after all.)\n\n* * *\n\nActor turned writer turned writer-director Taylor Sheridan is recognizable for recurring roles on \"Sons of Anarchy\" and \"Veronica Mars.\" Quietly, though, he has emerged as a screenwriter trafficking in brutal, unflinching honesty; he penned Denis Villeneuve's excellent drug-war thriller \"Sicario\" and David Mackenzie's heartbreaking western \"Hell or High Water.\" Now, directing his own screenplay in \"Wind River,\" he is emerging as the best dramatist of the desperate, forgotten elements of contemporary America.\n\nWhen a young Native American woman is found murdered on a remote part of the Wind River Indian Reservation, a rookie FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) is called in by sheer proximity; she's attending a wedding nearby. (And, of course, most agents with seniority don't want to be bothered.) She finds a world-weary police chief (Graham Greene), a furious and uncooperative father (Gil Birmingham) and a haunted professional hunter (Jeremy Renner), the moods and cynicism of whom she must navigate to solve the case.\n\n\"Wind River\" is a film about the hopelessness and marginalization of the first Americans -- and the tensions which arise when those hungry for oil and work once again invade their land. It's bleak by design, of course, but it borders on essential viewing for a more complete picture of the confusing, divided country we find ourselves in.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Montage: The Sen. John Heinz History Center hosts a premiere screening of \"Missing McKeesport,\" a documentary looking back at the once-thriving Jewish community in the riverfront town, this Sunday in the museum's Mueller Center. The screening is included with museum admission, but advance registration is recommended ... Release dates keep moving around here, so a few unexpected changes for this week: Steven Soderbergh's \"Logan Lucky\" is opening this Friday (I haven't seen it yet), as is the buzzing dance-team documentary \"Step.\" \"Lady Macbeth,\" which I thought was opening two weeks ago (and liked very much), actually opens today ... As mentioned in After Dark earlier this month, AMC Waterfront 22 will on Wednesday present the newly restored, 3-D version of \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\" I'm not usually one for 3-D conversions of old flicks, but this one purports to be the most careful and technically painstaking yet.

It became more brutal, but also more real.\n\nThat movie's notoriously shocking finale, in which the two outlaws were riddled with bullets in balletic slow-motion, was deliberately intended to evoke the Kennedy assassination four years earlier.\n\nBut Penn also meant it as a reference to the raging Vietnam War. He wanted to show that the forces of 'good' could be even nastier than the alleged bad guys.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nUnderwhelming: The Hitman's Bodyguard is not much good, but it's not exactly bad either. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson are charismatic leads and there are some pulse-quickening action sequences\n\nIn other words, there was a point to those horribly graphic deaths. But 50 more years in the so-called evolution of cinema have seen film-makers become steadily less mature in their treatment of violence, resulting in the grotesque spectacle of people being murdered and maimed not as an attempt to appeal, but to amuse.\n\nIn other words, more and more corpses are piling up on screen in the name of comedy.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard is the latest example of this deeply worrying trend. It's not much good, but it's not exactly bad either. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson are charismatic leads and there are some pulse-quickening action sequences. But heavens above, it's bloody. And worse than glorifying or romanticising violence, which Bonnie And Clyde arguably did all those years ago, it trivialises it.\n\nBoring: Rather than glorifying or romanticising violence, which Arthur Penn's Bonnie And Clyde arguably did all those years ago, it trivialises it\n\nFor example, in a blatant contrivance to maximise the potential for 'comedic' pain, director Patrick Hughes steers an Amsterdam chase scene through a restaurant kitchen and on into a hardware store. So one baddie gets his face griddled next to the burgers, and another is garrotted by a length of chain.\n\nHilarious, I know. And to emphasise just how lightly we're meant to take all this, the violence gets a cheerful musical accompaniment; Chuck Berry singing Little Queenie, a regular foot-tapper.\n\nAnd there's a grisly torture scene, also played for laughs.\n\nDrama: Elsewhere a trial is unfolding at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In the dock is the former leader of Belarus, a savage war criminal called Dukhovich (Gary Oldman)\n\nAs for the plot facilitating all this jaunty brutality, Reynolds plays Michael Bryce, an 'executive protection agent' whose CIA training has turned him into the world's best bodyguard.\n\nWe first meet him shepherding a Japanese arms dealer onto a private jet in London, but when his client gets it in the neck, Bryce's reputation crumbles.\n\nA couple of years later, he is reduced to protecting a cocaine-addled businessman (a cameo, or rather a hameo, for Richard E. Grant, over-acting with his customary pop-eyed zeal).\n\nBizarre: For some implausible reason, the testimony of only one man can convict him. That man is Darius Kinkaid (Samuel L. Jackson), the world's greatest assassin, who is serving a lengthy prison sentence in Manchester, of all places\n\nMeanwhile, a trial is unfolding at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In the dock is the former leader of Belarus, a savage war criminal called Dukhovich (Gary Oldman).\n\nFor some implausible reason, the testimony of only one man can convict him. That man is Darius Kinkaid (Samuel L. Jackson), the world's greatest assassin, who is serving a lengthy prison sentence in Manchester, of all places.\n\nA squad of Interpol agents must get Kincaid safely to the trial, but someone at Interpol is feeding information to Dukhovich, and his goons are waiting to pounce in Coventry city centre.\n\nBefore you've had time to ask yourself why on earth anyone would pass through Coventry on the way from Manchester to The Hague, a gunfight erupts the like of which Coventry has certainly never seen.\n\nImplausible: A squad of Interpol agents must get Kincaid safely to the trial, but someone at Interpol is feeding information to Dukhovich, and his goons are waiting to pounce in Coventry city centre\n\nEven by OK Corral standards, it's a bit much. But one of the few survivors is Interpol agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung), who promptly calls her ex-boyfriend, Bryce, and gives him the job of transporting Kincaid on to the Netherlands, so that he can nail the dastardly Dukhovich.\n\nThe problem with this is that the two men are sworn enemies; Kincaid has tried to kill Bryce 28 times. So what follows is like a histrionic version of Midnight Run, the 1988 comedy in which Robert De Niro's bounty hunter traded insults with Charles Grodin's mob accountant as he tried to get him safely across America.\n\nCertainly, the script by Tom O'Connor (not, I think, the silver-haired Liverpudlian comedian of the same name, former presenter of TV's Name That Tune) strives desperately for the same sort of edgy rapport that made Midnight Run such a delight.\n\nNice try: Reynolds and Jackson give it their best shot, and succeed in raising a few laughs\n\nReynolds and Jackson give it their best shot, too, and succeed in raising a few laughs.\n\nBut violence is the name of the tune here. Violence and almost incontinent profanity, not least from Salma Hayek as Kincaid's imprisoned wife, who inhabits one of two very sketchily-drawn sub-plots. The other concerns Bryce's break-up with Roussel, about which we are supposed to care even though the script doesn't.\n\nWith little else hitting the multi-plexes this week, The Hitman's Bodyguard may be the best of a mediocre lot. But it is an instantly forgettable film, notable only for its contribution to a disturbing slide in cinematic morality.\n\nThe Dark Tower (12A)\n\nRating: *****\n\nVerdict: Hopelessly muddled\n\nIn STEPHEN KING'S series of horror-sci-fi-fantasy novels inspired The Dark Tower, which is a promising start for any project.\n\nAfter all, it was King's writing which yielded The Shining, The Shawshank Redemption, Misery and Stand By Me, among many other fine movies. The Dark Tower does not belong in such exalted company.\n\nThere is plenty to like, especially a terrific lead performance by young Tom Taylor as Jake, an 11-year-old American boy propelled through a portal (in Brooklyn, naturally) into unimaginable inter-galactic adventures.\n\nGood effort: Idris Elba puts in a decent shift as a strong silent gunman in The Dark Tower\n\nIdris Elba also puts in a decent shift as Jake's other-worldly protector, a strong silent gunman. Together, they're a little like Brandon deWilde and Alan Ladd in the classic 1953 Western, Shane . . . with monsters.\n\nOn the whole, though, this is a chaotically muddled affair, which tries to marry The Lord Of The Rings with The Hunger Games with the old-fashioned Hollywood western, and inevitably fails.\n\nThe title refers to a vast structure which protects everyone in the universe from the forces of darkness.\n\nOnly the minds of certain 'special' children are pure and strong enough to topple the tower and unleash Armageddon, so Matthew McConaughey -- playing a cross between Jack Palance in Shane, the Childcatcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Christopher Walken in almost anything you care to mention, and the devil himself -- needs to harness them.\n\nNot good: On the whole, though, this is a chaotically muddled affair, which tries to marry The Lord Of The Rings with The Hunger Games with the old-fashioned Hollywood western, and inevitably fails\n\nJake, growing up in New York with his lovely mother and not-so-lovely stepfather, is one such child. He has such strong psychic powers that he can visualise both McConaughey's 'Man in Black' and his nemesis, Elba's 'Gunslinger', even before he meets them. So when he does, he has a vague idea of what's going to happen.\n\nUnfortunately, director Nikolaj Arcel is similarly vague. There are a handful of brilliant sequences let down by an undisciplined narrative, and McConaughey somehow both overdoes it and underdoes it. If you can imagine a laconic, Texan pantomime villain, that's pretty much what he is.\n\nThe Dark Tower has by all accounts taken years to reach the screen. It really wasn't worth the wait.\n\nDon't bother: The Dark Tower has by all accounts taken years to reach the screen.

Jackson's admirers may have a better time, if only because it's one more chance to see him play someone other than Nick Fury.\n\nWhen we meet Reynolds's Michael Bryce, he's on top of the world: head of a personal-protection empire that works like clockwork and is (as we'll hear ceaselessly) \"Triple-A rated\". Then he somehow lets a Japanese arms merchant catch a bullet through the forehead, and things fall apart.\n\nTwo years later, Bryce retains his skills but is working for peanuts, wearing a busted watch and shuttling clients around in an economy car that (as we'll hear ceaselessly) \"smells like ass\". But he's about to get a shot at redemption.\n\nBryce's old girlfriend, Interpol agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung, Elektra in Marvel's Daredevil), has learned that a mole in the organisation compromises the safety of a prisoner entrusted to her. She needs someone completely out of the loop to take care of Jackson's Darius Kinkaid - and who's less in the loop than Bryce? After she promises she can get him back in the good graces of high-rolling clients, Bryce agrees to help.\n\nKinkaid needs protection because, despite being in prison for innumerable counts of murder-for-hire, he's the star witness in an International Criminal Court case against Belarusian war criminal Vladislav Dukhovich (Oldman), who has an army of goons intent on killing him before he testifies.\n\nIn a preposterous contrivance, Dukhovich is going to be set free if Kinkaid can't make it to court in The Hague by 5pm that afternoon.\n\nFrom the start, Kinkaid displays an eagerness to leave his custodian behind and kill his would-be assassins by himself. But he's never looking to actually escape: He's willing to serve out his life sentence for his own crimes, so long as officials will keep their promise to pardon his also-imprisoned wife Sonia (Hayek) if he co-operates. (In a dopily amusing flashback, we see how Sonia won Darius's heart in a cantina brawl.)\n\nThough they're at each other's throats throughout, the two men obviously need to work together if Kinkaid is to testify and Bryce is to relaunch his firm. Tom O'Connor's screenplay works hard to stretch their feud out to sustain second-act conflict, but its banter is uninspired, hardly distracting us from the cookie-cutter nature of the underlying plot.\n\nEven with the relative novelty of Dutch settings (which allow for a boat-cars-motorcycle chase sequence in Amsterdam), the picture feels far more generic than its A-list cast would suggest. A couple of scenes that ironically employ soft-rock standards suggest that the film-makers were shooting for a more smart-ass tone, but Atli \u00d6rvarsson's overheated score works strenuously against that effect, as does Hughes's pedestrian direction.\n\nThe Hitman's Bodyguard offers more than enough shoot-'em-up to keep audiences munching their popcorn, but sharper talents behind the camera might have made it more enjoyable. - The Hollywood Reporter\n\nIOL", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri":

Jackson in macho-and-mouthy mode as a profanely proficient deadly assassin and Salma Hayek as the sexy spitfire of a spouse who is devoted to him -- all combust with masterful comic chemistry as they play off their well-established cinematic personas.\n\nAs for the high-speed vehicular stunts, they are breathless, relentless, endless -- and a bit too numbingly generic.\n\nStill, the main concept of lethal frenemies who must put aside their grudges for a common goal is a tried-and-true trope, as writer Tom O'Connor acknowledges with echoes of everything from \"48 HRS.\" and \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" to \"Midnight Run\" and \"The Gauntlet.\" But the real draw, much like Russell Crowe vs. Ryan Gosling in \"The Nice Guys\" and Kevin Hart vs. Dwayne Johnson in \"Central Intelligence,\" is the odd-couple matchup.\n\nHearty laughter does ensue as Reynolds' cautious Michael Bryce is forced to keep Jackson's reckless Darius Kincaid safe while transporting him from London to the Hague so he can testify against a genocidal Belarusian tyrant. As the villain, Gary Oldman -- sadly, not exactly running on all thespian cylinders -- recycles his Russian accent from \"Air Force One\" while his disfigured face appears to be coated in crusty bread crumbs. Luckily, the main dudes are on the ball as they race against the clock during their hazard-prone road trip while turning the art of bickering into a non-stop aria of foul-mouthed mutual belligerence and, eventually, reluctant respect.\n\nWhen Bryce complains that Kincaid keeps putting him in harm's way, Jackson goes full bellow: \"I AM harm's way. My job is to harm.\" Of course, the bodyguard should know that since his passenger has attempted to take him down no less than 28 times over the years. There are in-jokes, such as when Bryce grouses that Kincaid \"single-handedly ruined the word 'motherfucker.'\" There are also musical beats, as Kincaid insists on drunkenly singing a bluesy number to pass the time in the car, while Bryce counters by warbling a falsetto version of Ace of Base's \"I Saw the Sign.\" And little did I think I would ever see Jackson gleefully harmonizing in a van filled with habit-wearing Italian nuns as if he were trying out for the Mother Superior in \"The Sound of Music.\"\n\nThat doesn't even cover the contributions of Hayek, whose Sonia is being kept in a Dutch jail in order to guarantee Kincaid will provide evidence against Oldman's baddie. It is a hoot to see the actress calmly strike yoga poses behind bars as she fiercely lashes out like a flame-thrower at any law official stupid enough to hassle her. Meanwhile, she intimidates her cellmate into standing in the corner. Maybe Hayek should book a guest appearance on \"Orange is the New Black.\" But one of the best scenes is a flashback showing how Kincaid met Sonia when she was a waitress at a Mexican bar, swooning over how she took care of hand-sy male customers by cutting them broken beer bottles. The use of Lionel Richie's \"Hello\" in the background adds a nice romantic touch.\n\nLess successful is Bryce's attempt to reunite with onetime squeeze Amelia (French import Elodie Yung), an Interpol agent whom he blames for getting a client of his shot. The flashback to their first lusty encounter at a funeral is cut short by the arrival of murderous thugs. But the actors can't summon the same kind of heat generated by Jackson and Hayek, who calls her hubby \"La Cucaracha,\" since she says, \"He's un-killable.\"\n\nWhile no one is going to mistake \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" for high art, it will please those in the mood for late-summer fun. But why did I feel so emotionally depleted by the cartoony chaos unleashed in the name of entertainment by director Patrick Hughes (\"The Expendables 3\"), when the body count among the mostly anonymous victims of violence -- often dispatched in the name of humor -- began to balloon to astronomical proportions? The nearly constant annihilation of no-good-niks increasingly gnawed at me considering how much of the vehicular mayhem takes place in cities where terror attacks earlier this year were conducted on major urban thoroughfares -- namely, London and Amsterdam. Nothing like real horrifying incidents to turn what was meant as a fantasy into a mirror -- and that includes the tragic death in Charlottesville. There is also a streak of nasty sadism when Oldman's meanest mercenary corners Bryce in a garage where he resorts to an ax, a hammer, and a metal chain used as a noose and, ultimately, a gun to vanquish his opponent. Cruel jokes too often become hollow jokes.\n\nBesides, I believe when it comes to action thrillers beyond the realm of comic-books that older audiences -- who lately are also the most loyal audiences in actual theaters -- hunger for more thoughtful stories and compelling characters in the vein of \"Hell or High Water\" or \"Wind River.\" Even something as pop-fizzy as \"Baby Driver\" has a beating heart and a sense of moral purpose in its engine. At one point, Kincaid does bring up an existential conundrum: Who is in the most righteous profession? He who kills evil doers or he who protects those who commit evil? That is about as deep as this carnage-a-thon gets.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 100, "id": 7, "label": "dmoz/Arts"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books",

Jackson and still winds up mostly firing blanks. A bloody buddy movie, the action-comedy puts its stars' appeal to the test, as they bicker and blast their way through Europe in roughly that order.\n\nThere's an old-school quality to the formula, but the execution quickly yields diminishing returns. Despite the occasional burst of silliness, it's a pallid version not only of the leads' past roles, but prior odd-couple pairings like \"48 Hrs.\" or \"Midnight Run.\"\n\nIn that spirit, the paper-thin plot unfolds against the deadline of a ticking clock, which casts Jackson as Darius Kincaid, a notorious hitman. He's in the custody of Interpol, which has 27 hours to transport him from England to The Hague in the Netherlands, where he's scheduled to testify against a ruthless dictator (Gary Oldman, at half-speed by his bad-guy standards) who stands accused of war crimes.\n\nAfter the first of many, many gun battles (all waged at a decibel level set on \"deafening\"), an Interpol agent (\"Daredevil's\" Elodie Yung) recruits her former boyfriend, Michael Bryce (Reynolds), to get Kincaid to the court on time. Bryce is a private-security specialist who has hit a rough patch, and he has some history with his new charge, so much so that at first glance the two try to kill each other.\n\nMuch bantering, colorful cursing (it's Samuel L. Jackson, after all) and chases involving the aforementioned dictator's disposable minions follow, along with modest crumbs about our heroes' respective pasts. In Kincaid's case, for example, he's cooperating with authorities to win the release of his wife (Salma Hayek), who, rather adorably, is every bit as foul-mouthed, ill-tempered and violent as her hubby.\n\nReynolds has a knack for mixing mayhem with smart-alecky ripostes, but as constituted here it at best feels like \"Deadpool\" lite. Ditto for Jackson, in a weak variation of his Quentin Tarantino roles, as director Patrick Hughes never quite gets a handle on the tone as the movie oscillates between grisly violence and smirk-y throwaway lines.\n\nThe result is thus neither fish nor fowl, and too chaotic and episodic (argue, fight, repeat) to even serve as an enticing European travelogue. While it goes without saying that the hitman and his reluctant protector will forge a grudging bond, the two run out of fresh insults and schoolyard taunts long before they exhaust their supply of bullets.\n\nOne of the recurring gags pivots on Kincaid's survival skills -- a guy so hard to kill that his wife refers to him as a cockroach. The abundant explosions notwithstanding, \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" gradually feels as if it, too, is just sort of crawling along, until you start to wish that somebody would step on it.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" opens in the U.S. on Aug. 18.

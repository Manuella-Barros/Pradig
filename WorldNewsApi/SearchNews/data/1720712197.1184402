Even when they include relatively few pages, each scrapbook is still big and bulky because of the cover, thick pages, photographs, glued-in trinkets and clear page protectors. Thank you, Creative Memories. She loved assembling them and they look great. But after she started, I always wondered why someone didn\u2019t just come out with a coffee table-style photo book loaded with family photos printed permanently in one nice book that we\u2019d actually look through every now and then. One that could condense our two dozen scrapbooks into one nicely bound edition. And then a bunch of services like Shutterfly started popping up that accomplished just that. Too late for my home, I guess. But score for everyone else. That said, we recently came across a service called Mixbook. It\u2019s been around since 2006, but is new to me. In fact, I discovered that it\u2019s a leading photo book and photo products brand. One reason it\u2019s so alluring is its very intuitive smartphone app that makes photo book creation super easy, with hundreds of designs, themes and templates. Aside from photo books, the company lets you make canvas prints, photo calendars, metal prints, photo greeting cards, posters, etc. My daughter tried it out. She only had prior experience toying around with Shutterfly\u2019s system to see what it would take to make a photo book and Costco\u2019s to create a photo blanket. But she said Mixbook was extremely easy to put together both a book and a metal print. She solely used the Mixbook website in her iPhone Safari browser to do the job. Never touched her computer. And the result was nothing short of excellent. Merely on the site as a guest \u2013 and not creating an account \u2013 she initially set out with a blank canvas type of option before zeroing in on a template that was themed the way she envisioned. But even within that template, she was still able to go in and change the page layouts to however she wanted. She said it was fast, easy and fun to upload her photos directly from her camera roll. Resizing images was a breeze, as was zooming in, cropping, angling, and adding text. Speaking of, changing the font and font size to fit the vibe was also intuitive. She also mentioned it was great that Mixbook will warn you if you accidentally select the same photo twice. Hers was a 20-page book that arrived quickly and looks amazing. It\u2019s very substantial with a photo cover that\u2019s smooth and bright, and thick pages that are nicely bound into the spine. She chose a square shape, although there were other shapes and sizes available \u2013 with glossy, matte or satin finishes on the cover. Photos came out vibrant and perfectly saturated. Her metal print, by the way, has a built-in stand on the back.

The creativity process is essentially the same as with a true scrapbook, too \u2013 you just design pages on your phone rather than by hand. I asked my wife if we could just digitize all of her scrapbooks into one Mixbook. She gave a hard no on that \u2013 only because she enjoys the form factor of her scrapbooks. I get it \u2013 she put a lot of hard work and hours into them. But if it\u2019s not too late in your home, this service is a great way to preserve your memories. Follow me on LinkedIn.

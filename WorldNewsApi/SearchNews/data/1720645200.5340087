{"id": 231366348, "title": "Bankrupt Rudy Giuliani\u2019s partner in comeback coffee business is also bankrupt", "text": "Former New York mayor and Trump ally Rudy Giuliani is in the middle of a massive personal bankruptcy case \u2013 and one of the businesses he\u2019s using to get back in the black, a Florida-based coffee roaster, is also reportedly bankrupt. In May, Giuliani launched Rudy Coffee, a signature coffee line with politically-themed flavors like \u201cFighting for Justice\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor.\u201d His partner in the venture is Burke Brands, the South Florida-based maker and distributor of Don Pablo coffee, The Daily Beast reported. In December of 2022, Burke itself filed for Chapter 11, almost exactly a year before Giuliani filed for bankruptcy in December 2023, after he was ordered to pay $148m to Georgia election workers in a defamation case. A lawyer for the coffee brand told the South Florida Business Journal in May that the bankruptcy was the result of Burke facing a cash crunch during the pandemic and having to turn to high-interest lenders. As recently as last month, the company was describing itself as having emerged from Chapter 11 and saved its 75 employees\u2019 jobs. \u201cThey kept their customers, especially their main ones at Costco and Sam\u2019s Club and online,\u201d attorney Aaron Wernick told the journal. However, later that month, on May 17, the company sought to modify a court-approved plan to pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars to creditors in two large installments, instead asking for monthly payments. Wernick insisted to The Daily Beast the modification was unrelated to Giuliani\u2019s separate bankruptcy case. \u201cIt had completely to do with the fact that we had scheduled all our general and unsecured creditor payments for the beginning of the year, and we wanted to have them spread out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier on cash flow to have monthly payments rather than big chunks.\u201d The Independent has contacted Wernick and Giuliani for comment. The coffee brand came to the attention of Giuliani\u2019s creditors last month, who alleged the former mayor\u2019s deal with the roaster funnels money into a corporate account linked to Giuliani, a means to divert income away from his debts. \u201cMore than five months ago, the Debtor commenced his bankruptcy case. One might ask what he has accomplished during that time. An objective review leads to one conclusion: he has accomplished almost nothing,\u201d they argued in a court brief last month. They also slammed the Trump advisor\u2019s \u201cegregious spending habits,\u201d highlighting \u201c60 Amazon transactions, charges for entertainment such as Netflix, Prime Video, Kindle, Audible, Paramount+ and Apple services and products and numerous Uber rides.\u201d On Friday, the judge in Giuliani\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings approved a plan to enlist Sotheby\u2019s International Realty to sell the former mayor\u2019s multi-million dollar apartment, calling it a \u201ca sound exercise of business judgment.\u201d The former New York mayor\u2019s bankruptcy could end up costing him his apartment, his jewelry and his prized Joe DiMaggio replica shirt.", "summary": "<p>Florida-based roaster filed for Chapter 11 in December 2022 </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/rudy-giuliani-coffee-bankruptcy-case-b2559210.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/22/16/Screenshot%202024-05-22%20at%2011.13.17%20AM.png?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/yoaj98IY-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:31:26", "author": "Josh Marcus", "authors": ["Josh Marcus"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.283}

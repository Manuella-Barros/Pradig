{"id": 231223052, "title": "Six Great Short-Story Collections to Dip Into", "text": "For many years, I assumed that the appeal of a short story was that it was, well, short. Instead of slowly reading a novel over weeks, the reader of these bite-size plots can experience character development, crisis, and conclusion in just a few thousand words. But intentionally reading more short stories made me realize that I\u2019d underestimated the form. These works aren\u2019t just compressed novels: They offer an entirely different experience. The writer Joy Williams, who has published both novels and short stories to great praise, once observed: \u201cA novel wants to befriend you, a short story almost never.\u201d Many short stories can be aloof and enigmatic. They pose difficult questions about life and love, and rarely provide answers. But short stories have other rewards. Whereas a novel might unfold at a leisurely pace, a short story has velocity and verve. And the best ones create an immediate, instinctual bond between the reader and the characters. The format is an inviting place for writers to experiment. Whereas novels are typically expected to give us closure, short stories favor uncertain and searching conclusions\u2014a quality that makes them feel more similar to the incomplete journeys of our own lives. The six collections below, which take place in realistic and fantastical settings, show off the dazzling range of the short story. Each proves, too, how even brief encounters with a fictional world can linger well after we turn the page. The Penguin Book of Japanese Short Stories, edited by Jay Rubin In this idiosyncratic collection of Japanese short stories, \u201cquite old works and very new works\u201d appear side by side, \u201clike an iPod and a gramophone on the same shelf,\u201d Haruki Murakami writes in the introduction. Stories by well-known writers including Murakami, Yukio Mishima, and Yasunari Kawabata (who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968) appear alongside writers who have been translated into English more recently: Banana Yoshimoto, Y\u014dko Ogawa, Mieko Kawakami, and others. The anthology is organized into seven themes, making it easy to pick a story based on your mood. For a sobering encounter with history, turn to the sections \u201cDread\u201d and \u201cDisasters, Natural and Man-Made.\u201d You\u2019ll find stories such as Y\u016bichi Seirai\u2019s \u201cInsects,\u201d where a young girl awakes after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki with only a grasshopper for company, and Y\u016bya Sat\u014d\u2019s \u201cSame as Always,\u201d a cheerfully disturbing story about an exhausted mother who poisons her baby with irradiated vegetables and tap water. Want something lighter and more playful? Under \u201cModern Life and Other Nonsense,\u201d you\u2019ll find comical stories, such as K\u014dji Uno\u2019s \u201cCloset LLB,\u201d which describes an idealistic and lazy college graduate who refuses to pick a path in life. And I found myself lingering over Mieko Kawakami\u2019s \u201cDreams of Love, Etc.,\u201d where a bored housewife in Tokyo befriends an older woman learning to play Liszt on the piano. Your Duck Is My Duck, by Deborah Eisenberg Eisenberg is the rare writer who focuses exclusively on the short story. She\u2019s also one of its most acclaimed practitioners: Eisenberg was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 1987 and a MacArthur genius grant in 2009. In Your Duck Is My Duck, her most recent collection, she compassionately documents the difficulties of both youth and old age. The children in her stories struggle toward independence, as in \u201cCross Off and Move On,\u201d where a young girl is caught between two competing lifestyles: the severe discipline of her mother\u2019s world, and the languid glamor represented by her aunts Adela, Bernice, and Charna. Other stories detail the quiet regrets of the elderly: The aging actors in \u201cTaj Mahal\u201d gossip about their shared, debauched past while \u201cwaiting with patience and humility to be issued new roles, new shapes.\u201d Throughout, Eisenberg\u2019s intimate, descriptive prose depicts how concerns about money, love, death, and art shape us: \u201cI\u2019m hurtling through time,\u201d a painter remarks in one story, \u201cstrapped to an explosive device, my life.\u201d The Musical Brain, by C\u00e9sar Aira, translated by Chris Andrews Aira is renowned for his energetically surrealist fables and for his prolific output\u2014at 75, the Argentinian writer has published more than 100 books. In The Musical Brain, his first short-story collection published in English, Aira makes ideas from physics, math, and art history enchant and delight readers. \u201cGod\u2019s Tea Party\u201d imagines the deity\u2019s birthday celebration, where only apes are invited (humanity, the narrator informs us, has \u201cdisappointed Him\u201d)\u2014and the chaos that ensues when a subatomic particle gatecrashes the event in a \u201csystematic, unstoppable, and supremely elegant\u201d manner. Another story, \u201cA Thousand Drops,\u201d is about the perfect art heist: The paint droplets that make up the Mona Lisa escape the Louvre to go on their own adventures. One drop hitchhikes to the Vatican and has an affair with the Pope, while another builds a basketball stadium in rural Mongolia, in the hopes of training a Chinese team to defeat the NBA\u2019s all-stars. Other stories revel in the fanciful pleasures of childhood games: In \u201cThe Infinite,\u201d two boys try to name successively larger numbers, until they learn about the showstopping power of the word infinity. Each short story is a thrilling intellectual adventure, with Aira gleefully demolishing the division between the sciences and the arts. Break It Down, by Lydia Davis Davis is a master of the very short story, and the collection that made her name, Break It Down, includes such works as the four-sentence \u201cWhat She Knew,\u201d where an insecure young woman tries to understand why men are flirting with her, and the six-sentence \u201cThe Fish,\u201d where a woman confronts \u201ccertain irrevocable mistakes\u201d in her life, including the dinner she\u2019s cooked for herself. These nimble, acrobatic shorts\u2014which established her as a formidable figure in American literature\u2014are contrasted by longer stories that showcase Davis\u2019s dry humor and keen emotional insight. In \u201cThe Letter,\u201d a woman sits through a long-awaited breakup conversation: \u201cRight away she lost her appetite, but he ate very well and ate her dinner too.\u201d And the title story is a cathartic, sensitive look at the cost of a failed relationship: \u201cYou\u2019re left with this large heavy pain in you,\u201d a man mourning a lost love reflects, \u201cthat you try to numb by reading.\u201d Davis\u2019s stories plunge directly into the hurt of everyday life, leaving the reader both comforted and entertained. Pond, by Claire-Louise Bennett \u201cI find mundane objects rather poignant,\u201d Bennett once said, shortly after Pond was published. The 20 stories in this collection offer evocative glimpses of one woman\u2019s life in rural Ireland. Many stories focus on the joys of cooking and entertaining: \u201cOh, Tomato Puree!\u201d is a whimsical paean to the \u201ckitsch and concentrated splendour\u201d of this pantry staple, while \u201cFinishing Touch\u201d shows a woman carefully planning a party: \u201cPerfectly arranged but low-key,\u201d she reminds herself, having plucked flowers from the garden to \u201cexude an edgeless, living fragrance.\u201d Other stories reveal the narrator\u2019s trembling, urgent desire for human connection. In \u201cA Little Before Seven,\u201d she reflects ruefully on the difficulty of flirting with a love interest. \u201cAwaiting that kiss which somehow settles everything,\u201d she is hesitant and awkward\u2014until a drink emboldens her, and she concludes that \u201cthere is no such thing as a false move.\u201d Bennett\u2019s stories are a mesmerizing, strange look at the inner workings of the mind, as well as the beauty of our domestic and natural surroundings. Exhalation, by Ted Chiang In Ted Chiang\u2019s science fiction, advanced technologies and alternate realities are the backdrop for deeply human stories. He catapulted to fame with his first collection, Stories of Your Life and Others\u2014and that book\u2019s title story was adapted into the film Arrival, directed by Denis Villeneuve. In his second collection, Exhalation, Chiang writes thoughtful, searching narratives that explore AI\u2019s risks and rewards, species extinction, archaic theories of consciousness, and more. In \u201cThe Lifecycle of Software Objects,\u201d a zookeeper named Ana joins a software start-up trying to make endearing AI pets. The start-up fails, but Ana and her coworker, Derek, can\u2019t abandon the digital creatures they\u2019ve grown to love: \u201cThe practice of treating conscious beings as if they were toys is all too prevalent,\u201d Derek muses, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t just happen to pets.\u201d Another story, \u201cThe Great Silence,\u201d shows an endangered parrot trying to communicate with humans: \u201cHuman activity has brought my kind to the brink of extinction, but I don\u2019t blame them for it \u2026 They just weren\u2019t paying attention.\u201d Chiang\u2019s fiction is informed by complex scientific concepts, but his writing style makes them accessible and compelling. Despite the unfamiliar settings, each story feels like a prescient and emotionally insightful commentary on the technological challenges facing us today.", "summary": "The form has velocity and verve, and the best examples create an immediate, instinctual bond between the reader and the characters.", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2024/06/short-story-book-recommendations/678637/", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/2LofW9WDWX5Spu0P1BUV9UvloNw=/0x61:2876x1559/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/06/short_stories_carlgodfrey/original.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:00:00", "author": "Celine Nguyen", "authors": ["Celine Nguyen"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.445}

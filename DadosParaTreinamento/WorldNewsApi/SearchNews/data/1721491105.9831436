In multiple videos posted to X, Sneako, 25, appears to snatch a security guard's hat off his head during an event at the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC). The security guard was doing a little dance on stage while flipping off the star and his friends, who were doing the same right back at him. Sneako, real name Nico Kenn De Balinthazy, is then seen being hit right in the mouth by the guard as he leaps into the crowd. In a video shot after the brief scuffle inside the venue, the person filming comes up to Sneako asking him to smile so he can show off his chipped tooth. A group of Sneako's fans then bash the security guard for supposedly attacking unprovoked. 'Nobody touched him,' Sneako said on the video, claiming that the security guard cut off an ongoing speech and drowned it out by playing music. While it isn't clear that Sneako himself reached through the crowd to grab the man's hat, someone in the streamer's vicinity did. It's not precisely known what precipitated this conflict, but the security guard, who is black, is heard yelling and talking about 'white supremacy' just before the punch. AFPAC, which has been held for four years running, has been described as a 'white supremacist event' by the Anti-Defamation League and was founded in 2020 by white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. After the security guard admonished the crowd for its supposed white supremacist views, he is seen getting angry at the people filming him. 'Get your f***ing cameras off my face,' he said, before pointing at individual people in the crowd and calling them names. 'You're a s**t and you're a w***e.' The crowd then started chanting 'f*** you' over and over again, while many also gave the security guard the finger. Standing on a stage slightly above the people yelling at him, the security guard appeared unbothered, dancing and holding his middle fingers up at the irate throngs of partygoers. That's until his hat was violently ripped off his head. It took less than a second for him to dive into the crowd and punch who he believed was the culprit, Sneako. Sneako also addressed the punch in a Sunday post on X. 'Security guard sabotaged the event and turned off the mic. Started playing music and taunting the guests. He punched me and fell over. Chipped tooth. No big deal,' he wrote. 'America first. Israel last,' he added. He was seen speaking to a police officer on the street after the incident in the bar, possibly filing a report. Sneako was banned off Twitch and YouTube last year for seriously violating both platforms' terms of service, though he was reinstated on Twitch as recently as a week ago. The streamer, who primarily posts content on right-wing platform Rumble, is known for getting into debates with other creators about topics such as open relationships and what the age of consent should be. One of his most popular videos on his YouTube channel before it got banned was one in which he walked around on the street asking white people if they would say the N-word for a dollar. Sneako also has an interest in making martial arts content, deciding to spar with former UFC Middleweight Champion Sean Strickland in February. He also recently chatted with Nate Diaz, who famously beat Conor McGregor in one of their 2016 fights.", "summary": "Dramatic footage shows popular American streamer Sneako getting punched in the face by a security guard during a far right wing political event in Detroit.

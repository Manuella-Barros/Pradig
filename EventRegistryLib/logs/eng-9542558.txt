'We will go as we want. This movement arose naturally, and it is going naturally'.\n\nLocal residents in Kirants have expressed fears that the delimitation process would divide their village between Armenia and Azerbaijan, as based on a preliminary map of the delimited border, several houses and lands and a recently built school would fall on the Azerbaijani side of the border. Others have raised concerns that a closer border with Azerbaijan would raise risks of Azerbaijani attacks.\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia agreed to begin the long-delayed delimitation of their shared border on 19 April in the Tavush Province, prompting condemnation and protests from people living in border villages in Armenia.\n\n'This process must be stopped, our demand is very clear', noted Bagrat Srbazan.\n\n[Read more: Protests against border delimitation continue in northeast Armenia]\n\nOn Sunday, the leader of the Diocese of Shirak, Archbishop Mikeil Ajapahian, expressed his support for Tavush for the Motherland movement and Bishop Srbazan.\n\n'I fully support Bagrat Srbazan's course, I want you to know. Beyond this, everyone can decide for themselves the extent of their participation, or follow the instructions or directions that I may give, today, tomorrow or another day. Those who do not wish to obey my dictates unconditionally may feel free. And those who are expecting certain instructions and directions from me will receive them in the near future', said Ajapahian.\n\nWhile RFE/RL reports that the situation is now calm in Kirants, the village has seen several clashes with police as they successfully blocked several major roads since mid-April.\n\nLast week, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan held talks with representatives of the village in Yerevan, promising to offer them 'solutions'.\n\nHowever, the village's representative at the meeting refused to give extensive details as to what the government would do in response to their protest.\n\n'Nothing has changed, it remains as it was, there has been no change,' said Gohar Vardanyan, a resident of Kirants. Asked why the representatives of the village appeared agitated, Vardanyan said that it was because 'people will not live there [anymore], in Kirants'.\n\nThirty protesters were arrested in Kirants on 2 May, all of whom were later released. The road to the village was closed the same day, with entry blocked to all except for residents of the village. Restrictions on entering the village were lifted on the evening of 3 May.", "source": {"uri": "oc-media.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "OC Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_boundary_delimitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral boundary delimitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirants,_Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirants, Armenia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavush_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Tavush", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diocese of Tavush"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Shirak", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diocese of Shirak"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikol_Pashinyan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikol Pashinyan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://oc-media.org/app/uploads/2024/05/9cf7daf243e90fcc82bf0bcec148ba80_protesters-against-border-delimitation-in-northeast-armenia-march-to-yerevan-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542558", "eventUri": "eng-9542558", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 1163, "textEnd": 1171}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 2826, "textEnd": 2831}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 3045, "textEnd": 3050}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Participants of the action declared that they are heading to the capital to \"demand answers.\"\n\nRepresentatives of the ruling party emphasize that the movement participants do not make any political demands. As parliament speaker Alen Simonyan stated, it is unclear what process is even being discussed.\n\n\"Are we a theocracy, a religious state? What are we doing? And if it's not a clergyman speaking out, but a citizen, then he should come up with a proposal. When someone says they are against demarcation, they should present their proposal as a counterbalance,\" he told journalists.\n\nPolitical analyst Gurgen Simonyan sees the protest movement as problematic. Not because it is led by a clergyman, but because Russia and the local \"5th column\" stand behind it, using \"appropriate technologies and can exploit any situation for their own purposes.\"\n\nThe \"Tavush for the Sake of Homeland\" movement began its march on Saturday, May 4. Participants of the protest action are already in the Gegharkunik region and intend to reach Yerevan by May 9. Here, as they say, the protest actions will continue until the demarcation and delineation process is stopped.\n\nHow they will achieve this is unclear as they do not discuss it. Meanwhile, parallel to their action in the Tavush region, the process of demining and demarcating the border continues.\n\n\"This march will restore our honor and homeland,\" Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan declared the day before.\n\nThe procession involves artists, relatives of the victims of the 44-day war in Karabakh, and representatives of opposition political parties.\n\nAccording to Archbishop Galstanyan, this is not a fight between \"good and bad.\" The movement's goal is to \"stop the unacceptable process of border demarcation.\"\n\nWhen asked if the Holy See of Etchmiadzin, meaning the Catholicos, would join the movement, he replied, \"The Holy See is always with us. The Armenian Patriarch himself is our father, the one who blesses us and guides us.\"\n\nRelations between the Armenian Apostolic Church and the country's authorities have become strained after the 2020 war in Karabakh when the Catholicos of All Armenians called for the resignation of Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan.\n\nAll the photos are from the movement's Facebook page\n\n\"I respect all of our citizens who hold different opinions, with which I may not agree. However, I have not heard any political demands,\" stated the speaker of the Armenian Parliament in a conversation with journalists on Monday morning.\n\nIn response to the movement's demand to \"stop unilateral concessions,\" Alen Simonyan stated that Armenia is not making concessions but rather fixing its border based on legally binding maps.\n\nThe speaker also mentioned that he does not see any danger of a change in power in Armenia:\n\n\"A change in power in the Republic of Armenia is only possible through the results of parliamentary elections scheduled for 2026.\"\n\nAccording to him, the Armenian people trust the delineation and demarcation process and do not view \"certain church representatives as politicians\":\n\n\"And the people understand that the church, God, the emotions we experience as Christians, and the individuals who serve political interests today are different things. I do not believe that the people of Armenia have lost their wisdom.\"\n\nAdditionally, Simonyan speculated that the movement is associated with former Armenian president Robert Kocharyan. Simonyan sees an \"external trace\" in this process, pointing to Russia's interests in the region and the pro-Russian sentiments of Armenia's opposition.\n\nArchbishop Bagrat Galstyan has been leading the Tavush Diocese since 2015. He is actively engaged in social activities and has established several socio-educational centers and leadership schools in the region. He is highly respected and trusted by the residents of the area.\n\nIn the past two weeks, the archbishop has been actively involved in protests in Tavush villages where border demarcation is taking place.\n\nDuring this time, some media outlets published information claiming that he was allegedly involved in entrepreneurship, which was later refuted. Subsequently, the clergyman was falsely accused of \"having two sons whom he exempted from military service.\" This information was shared on their social media pages by some members of the ruling parliamentary faction. However, they later apologized, explaining that the source of their posts was publications in the press that did not reflect reality.\n\nThe movement is supported by former Armenian presidents Serzh Sargsyan and Robert Kocharyan, who are not widely respected in society, notes political analyst Gurgen Simonyan. In light of this, he believes that the protest movement will not gain significant momentum.\n\n\"Regardless of the issue the movement participants want to address, the list of involved actors alone is enough for the movement not to acquire a nationwide character,\" emphasized the political analyst.\n\nHe does not see a danger of establishing a theocracy in Armenia. However, he considers the involvement of Russia and the \"5th column\" problematic. Here lies, in his words, an \"external influence\":\n\n\"The Russian Federation wants to pursue an explosive and destabilizing policy in Armenia to bring to power forces that are more suitable and loyal to it. With their help, Russia intends to advance the military and political programs it needs in Armenia and in the region.\"\n\nIn the opinion of the political analyst, the head of the Tavush Diocese is an honest, patriotic individual who has been \"drawn into political processes\":\n\n\"The forces involved in the movement may simply be using his influence, based on their group or personal interests.\"\n\nGurgen Simonyan is confident that former presidents cannot rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of society as political figures, so they are trying to pass on the \"banner of their aspirations to the church.\"\n\nAccording to the analyst, the \"catastrophic situation observed in Armenia's domestic political space\" is a consequence of the fact that after the \"Velvet Revolution\" of 2018, no lustration took place.\n\nThe results of surveys show that only 7-14% of the population currently support the incumbent government of Armenia, and the \"former retrograde forces do not even reach two percent,\" says the expert.\n\nThose politicians rejected by society in 2018, he says, have no chance of returning to power, no matter how dissatisfied people are with the current government. Simonyan sees the need for the formation of a new political force that can win the sympathy of the people and become an alternative.", "source": {"uri": "jam-news.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

They have attracted strong support from a wide range of opposition groups as well as public figures critical of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian.\n\nGalstanian declined to shed light on the planned actions in Yerevan when he spoke to RFE/RL's Armenian Service during the march. Nor would he say whether he and other protest leaders will also be demanding Pashinian's resignation.\n\n\"The whole essence, basis of our movement is spiritual,\" he said. \"The truth must defeat lies in our country. That's enough. As for the cost and the price of that, we'll see.\"\n\nThe archbishop discreetly backed by the Armenian Apostolic Church also stressed that he has no political ambitions.\n\nPashinian's political allies, who have fiercely criticized and attacked Galstanian for the last two weeks, claimed to be unfazed by the impending antigovernment protests in the Armenian capital. One of them, parliament speaker Alen Simonian, said the protesters stand no chance of toppling the country's government.\n\n\"I don't even understand what kind of a process this is because I don't know if we are a theocracy and what are doing, now\" Simonian told reporters.\n\n\"This is a process aimed at leading Armenia to war and turning Armenia into a remote province of Russia,\" claimed Narek Babayan, a lawmaker from Pashinian's Civil Contract party. \"Therefore, I don't think that Armenia's citizens will support it.\"\n\n\"I don't take it seriously because there is no seriousness whatsoever in these processes,\" said Arusiak Julhakian, another Civil Contract deputy.\n\nGalstanian countered that Pashinian and his political team are \"scared\" of the movement led by him.

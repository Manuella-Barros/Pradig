Bethesda's lore references in Fallout games hint at future storylines, as seen with Fallout 4's Institute. Players discover hidden details in Fallout 3 even 16 years after release, sparking curiosity about future Fallout game hints.\n\nA Fallout 3 player online has noticed an interesting piece of foreshadowing relating directly to Fallout 76. It's cool to see that players still have some things to discover about Fallout 3, 16 years after its initial release.\n\nWhen it was released back in 2008, Fallout 3 received a ton of praise for its attention to detail. In fact, it's a praise that has been levied at plenty of Bethesda titles in the years since. The game was Bethesda's first effort into the post-apocalyptic franchise, and there are plenty of things players missed in Fallout 3 thanks to the sheer level of detail included in the game. With the game now 16 years old, it's fascinating that players are still discovering new things about Fallout 3, even if this particular detail was retroactively made relevant by the mere existence of Fallout 76.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4 Player Finds Strange Item After Hundreds of Hours of Playing\n\nAfter hundreds of hours of playing the game, a Fallout 4 player finds a strange hidden item, highlighting the smaller details in the open world.\n\nRedditor BoyDynamo shared their discovery online, which is found on a terminal in Fallout 3. When scouring the terminal for a list of \"DC Area Vault Listings,\" Vault 76 appears. There's even a full entry on the terminal, mentioning the goal of this Fallout Vault is to reopen to the world after 20 years, just as it does in Fallout 76. While it's almost certainly not the case that Bethesda planned the existence of the game as far back as 2008, it is cool to see that the studio pulled from existing lore when it came to deciding the Vault to be featured in Fallout 76.\n\nFallout 76 Foreshadowing Found in Fallout 3\n\nOther gamers in the thread pointed out that Fallout 3 features plenty of foreshadowing that can be seen in later games in the series. Fallout 4's Institute storyline is heavily alluded to in the quest, \"The Replicated Man,\" showing that some of these Bethesda references are thought through years in advance. The discovery of these kinds of things leads many to wonder about the kind of foreshadowing details that currently exist for Fallout 5 that are currently unknown.\n\nClose\n\nBethesda remains quiet on the future of the Fallout franchise. The studio is currently in the middle of development of The Elder Scrolls 6, which certainly doesn't seem set to release any time soon. It will be interesting to see what the solution is for Bethesda, as it certainly won't hand out the IP to a third-party developer lightly. It was recently revealed that Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian was interested in making a Fallout game, and while it's unlikely at this point, revisiting this idea would certainly be the dream scenario for many.\n\nFallout 3\n\nFallout 3 is the third installment of the mainline series and has players stepping into the Capital Wasteland. There, they will find a wide array of NPCs, side quests, and an engrossing unfolding story.\n\nAction RPG\n\nSystems\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PS3 , Xbox 360 , PC\n\nReleased October 28, 2008\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda Game Studios\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda Softworks\n\nESRB M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Sexual Themes, Strong Language, Use of Drugs\n\nHow Long To Beat 23 Hours\n\nPS Plus Availability Premium\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_morris@gamerant.com", "name": "Daniel Morris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 76"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur's_Gate_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baldur's Gate (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larian_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larian Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Elder Scrolls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wasteland (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action role-playing game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Game Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox 360"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game developer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fallout-3-76-terminal-foreshadowing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-10-28", "textStart": 3321, "textEnd": 3337}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

I've written several articles about it, but sometimes there are very special modifications to Bethesda games that you just have to try. One such mod is Fallout London. I first became aware of this unique project a year ago, and now it's finally out after being delayed by Bethesda's attempts to update the original Fallout 4. I modded the GOG version of Fallout 4, but if you have a version of the game with all the additions, you can easily play Fallout London too.\n\nFirstly, let me explain what it takes to get Fallout London to work. If you have the game on Steam, you need to downgrade Fallout 4. Everything you need is on the Nexus Mods website, and if you search for Fallout London, you can easily find the tools. Once you've installed them, head back to Nexus Mods and install two mods through Nexus' Mod Manager Vortex: the Buffout 4 modification and the Long Loading Times Fix. Once these are in place, you're ready to explore Broken London with only a few bugs and imperfections.\n\nThe story in Fallout London stays true to the general narrative of the Fallout universe. In 2077, the US and China went to war and bombed each other back to the Stone Age. The problem with nuclear wars is that the rest of the world gets destroyed too, and that includes London, which has been well and truly levelled. You wake up in a large test tube, surrounded by two scientists who tell you that you are their best experiment, but the lab is quickly attacked and the two scientists die before you get answers. You free yourself from your glass prison and try to escape the creepy building. Along the way you meet a mysterious person, Mr Smythe, who clearly knows what's going on and who you are. He calls your character The Wayfarer before seemingly meeting his doom. You escape the building and are met by the devastation of London, where you quickly encounter some members of the Vagabond faction who take you to their headquarters. Here you'll be given your first missions and then you'll be set free in the ruined streets of London to do as you please.\n\nIt's fantastic, and Bethesda themselves couldn't have done better than Team Folon, who made the modification. One thing I quickly realised was that there is more history hidden around the corners of London. There are holotapes in many buildings that tell interesting stories from people who have been in the area. It's amazing and gives you a great insight into the world. I would say that it's actually better than what Bethesda itself does. The main story is wonderfully mysterious and the many quests you find around London are interesting, which is impressive for a group of fans. Hats off to Team Folon.\n\nFallout London is full of English charm and eccentricity. All the voice actors are native English and the dialects follow the area, which is great. You also encounter a lot of English culture. For example, one of the first missions is to find sixteen blue police boxes. If you're even a little bit of a Dr Who fan, you'll know what that means. In addition, the factions are super English. There's the Hooligan faction and further into London you'll meet the Beefeater faction, which has a penchant for human flesh. If you're an Anglophile, Fallout London is a treasure trove of English culture and \"stiff upper lip,\" and of course litres of tea.\n\nFallout London is built on the skeleton of Fallout 4, so much of the game's design will feel familiar if you've played the main game. However, Team Folon has made things more primitive by borrowing mechanics from Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. First of all, your character is mute, so only the characters you meet speak. This helps with immersion as your character can make sounds as your imagination allows. The progression is a mix of the different Fallout games. You level up and earn perk points, which you get one per level. These perks are familiar from the other games in the series, but are balanced well and sometimes modified to be more useful. Some are stronger and some weaker than in Fallout 4, but they work great. I made a stealth Wayfarer, Binky Fuzzcoggle, because you have to have a silly English name. This specialised sneak was quite effective and really fun to play. You'll also find a whole bunch of cool new weapons, with only a small portion borrowed from Fallout 4. The modification system from Fallout 4 is back here, meaning you can upgrade your gear if you've picked up enough reusable junk. Fallout London is a Fallout game at its core, but the Folon team has really put their stamp on it and I had more fun at times than I did in Fallout 4 when I first played it years ago. It's crazy.\n\nFallout London is a huge game. The most popular parts of London are rendered in great detail and when you first encounter some of the most recognisable landmarks, it can be awe-inspiring. For example, I was walking around and suddenly found myself in front of The London Eye, which had now been turned into a housing estate with people living in the wheel and below. It was crazy to take the lift up to these buildings and look out over London, enjoying the detail and being impressed by how long it must have taken the Folon team to do just this small part of the modification. I had this experience all the time because Fallout London must have taken a huge amount of time. That's why the game is as big as Fallout 4 and Far Harbor combined. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay in Fallout London, and it's free. Ultra impressive! That's probably the biggest problem in Fallout London, because there are a lot of errors and bugs. Missions that don't quite work. Graphical glitches and the game crashes from time to time. Not so much after installing the Buffout modification, but it still happens, so remember to save. However, I would say it's no worse than Fallout 4 was when it first came out, and it's only minor annoyances in the grand scheme of things. Another thing that isn't the best either is the voice acting. It's generally fine, but you can notice that the sound changes depending on which microphone each actor has used. It can take you out of the experience sometimes.\n\nSo I can conclude by saying that if you're even a little bit of a Fallout fan, this mod is a must try. It's completely free and offers a fantastic take on what Fallout could be like outside the US Wasteland. It's an impressive project that provides hundreds of hours of Fallout entertainment, retaining Bethesda's game design but improving it almost universally. Well, enough of that - I need to go back and see if I can find the Tower of London and see if the Crown Jewels are there, and if they are, steal them.", "source": {"uri": "gamereactor.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameReactor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "claus_larsen@gamereactor.eu", "name": "Claus Larsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_Mods", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nexus Mods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folon_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folon Region"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Folon Region"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ivory Coast"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culture of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stone Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglophile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anglophile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skeleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dialect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experience point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tower of London"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.gamereactor.eu/media/80/writerfallout_3558093b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Aliens make a minor appearance in almost every Fallout game made. It's unclear if Fallout creators want fans to take alien lore seriously or as Easter eggs that impact canon.\n\nWhile Fallout fans were originally limited to a smaller pool of gamers who have enjoyed the series at some point in the franchise's history, with the introduction of the Fallout TV show, a whole new audience has an interest in the lore and story of the universe. While Fallout factions like the Brotherhood of Steel and the pseudo-remnants of the NCR debuted along with the show in April on Amazon Prime, there are several other factions and entire species within the games that have yet to be explored.\n\nAlthough Ghouls are obviously a central theme, other entities like mutants and Synths never made an appearance in its eight-episode run. That said, there's an even deeper-cut \"faction\" of creatures that have had a role in the vast majority of Fallout games that aren't talked about much -- either because of their limited impact on the game's overall story or their complex origins that could conflict with canon and create issues with the main narrative of the games.\n\nRelated\n\nEntire Fallout Timeline Explained: When Every Fallout Game Takes Place In Canon\n\nAlthough each game in the Fallout series functions as a mostly standalone story, they each have their place in the franchises' canon timeline.\n\nAliens Have Played A Role Throughout Many Fallout Games\n\nA Curious & Hard-To-Find Game Inclusion\n\nClose\n\nTo some, aliens fit in the retro-futuristic post-apocalyptic Atomic Age of the Fallout franchise, but to others, it takes focus away from the main narrative of human vs. human conflict. Aliens have appeared in some form in Fallout 1-3, New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76. In the Fallout universe, several different types of aliens make an appearance, but the most predominant race are the Zeta aliens, which were further fleshed out in the Fallout 3 DLC and expansion, Mothership Zeta.\n\nIn Mothership Zeta , the Lone Wanderer gets abducted, and the DLC takes place on the alien ship.\n\nIn the very first Fallout, the aliens made a minor appearance during the special encounter called \"Alien Ship.\" During this encounter, the player can find a UFO covered in sand with the words \"Property of Area 51, return if found\" on it. There are also two aliens, one with an alien blaster. While this is the extent of the interaction, it was the first introduction to the space travelers to the game.\n\nRelated\n\nWait, Do Aliens Actually Exist In Fallout?\n\nThe Fallout TV show is missing one essential element from the video games, and here is how aliens could influence the show going forward.\n\nIt's Unclear What Impact Aliens Have On Fallout Lore\n\nIt Could Be Huge, Or It Could All Be A Joke\n\nAlthough the background of the Zeta aliens has been well fleshed out at this point, it's unclear how seriously the Fallout creators want fans to take the lore in earlier games, Mothership Zeta, and other tertiary published media like the Fallout 3 Official Game Guide, which goes into more detail about the extraterrestrial beings. According to those materials, the aliens have been around since the '60s and have influenced factions like the Enclave and even the Brotherhood of Steel via alien power cells and other technology.\n\nAlthough their impact can be felt in the game, direct interactions with Aliens outside of specific content are rare. While it could explain some of the technology found in the universe, it seems like a pretty wide catch-all to explain things away, and it's not certain whether it's just an Easter egg or meant to be taken seriously. Regardless, it's much more likely viewers will see Super Mutants and other more predominant Fallout creatures before aliens ever make an appearance.\n\nCreated by Tim Cain , Leonard Boyarsky\n\nFirst TV Show Fallout\n\nVideo Game(s) Fallout , Fallout 2 , Fallout 3 , Fallout 4 , Fallout: New Vegas , Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel , Fallout 5 , Fallout 76", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_ettinger@screenrant.com", "name": "Garrett Ettinger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fallout_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Fallout (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3_downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 3 downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoul", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghoul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofuturism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retrofuturism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atomic Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Mutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 76"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_Tactics:_Brotherhood_of_Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Boyarsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonard Boyarsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 2"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/UFOs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/UFOs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fallout-4-the-marinerwith-a-ufo-and-super-mutant-and-some-robots-from-fallout-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Top contenders include Hawaii for a tropical paradise, Russia for a Soviet twist, and Colorado for a unique story continuation. International locations like China and Mexico also hold promise for expanding Fallout lore beyond American borders.\n\nThe Fallout franchise has always been unique in its oddly authentic depiction of their version of the world and its diverse locations.\n\nFrom Fallout 1, taking place on the West Coast of California, to Fallout 4's Eastern Coast setting of Boston, fans have walked wastelands across America, leading us to wonder where this franchise will end up next.\n\nWith Todd Howard already somewhat confirming Fallout 5, we've all been theorizing about the next potential location for this infamous franchise, so here are the top locations we at DualShockers believe would be the perfect setting for Fallout 5.\n\nAlthough the Fallout developers have stated their desire to stay within the United States, Fallout London's fan reception has had us wondering even more what international locations would fit the Fallout franchise, so we're including those, even if it's just a cry from fans. And while a lot of these locations sadly won't get an official release, you can check out many fan mods that showcase them.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout Writer Explains Jet Inhaler Was Inspired By Family's Asthma\n\nFallout 2's level designer Chris Avellone reveals the lore and real-life inspiration behind the game's Jet Inhaler.\n\n10 Hawaii\n\nA Tropical Fallout Getaway\n\nTake this location as our more exotic entry for this list. While Miami and New Orleans are other exotic American-based locations people consider, we feel the state of Hawaii can best serve Fallout's lore. With the current Fallout: Ashfall mod in the works, many of us have a hankering for a Fallout Hawaii vacation.\n\nThere are many intriguing places to imagine from a tropical Hawaiian Fallout title, like a preserved tropical hotel in the city of Honolulu, similar to New Vegas's Sierra Madre DLC, untouched for years, and a potential political commentary on the American commercialization of Hawaii.\n\nThis setting could also give Fallout a unique, water-centric, island feel, unlike anything we've had thus far. For these reasons, a tropical Fallout game will surely be on our minds for the future.\n\n9 Russia\n\nA Soviet Take On The Fallout Formula\n\nWith the Metro and Stalker series shining a light on how amazing nuclear/apocalyptic Soviet-Russian-themed games could be, many fans have attached this aesthetic to a potential Fallout project. Great examples are the many Fallout mods intended to shift Fallout's aesthetic closer to these Russian games.\n\nWith a Soviet-era aesthetic perfectly clashing against the bright post-WW2 era embodied by Fallout's retro-futuristic aesthetic of 2070s America, this would be a perfect project to mirror the games we've already played.\n\nSo, while a very unconventional idea, this retro-future Soviet setting in a city like Moscow could possibly be an amazing entry for a new Fallout game.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Outer Worlds 2 Has A Good Chance To Scratch That Fallout: New Vegas Itch\n\nThe Outer Worlds is quintessentially Obsidian.\n\n8 Colorado\n\nFallout, In The Rockies\n\nColorado has a lot of potential as an interesting location for a new Fallout game. It could bring players closer to the center of the United States, where we haven't been before. It could also give us a brilliant follow-up to Fallout: New Vegas fans have begged for, with continued stories of the Legion and NCR.\n\nWhile we fans hope this potential game is given to developers Obsidian, who are responsible for New Vegas, it's still a fun theory to think that New Vegas' amazing story could be continued with the NCR taking on the Legion in new territory.\n\n7 Philadelphia\n\nAnyone Want Radscorpion Cheesesteaks?\n\nAlongside Boston and Washington, it's clear how much Bethesda loves cities towards the eastern coast. So, alongside New York City, positioned later on this list, it's hard to escape the beckoning call coming from Philadelphia.\n\nWith places like the Freedom Trail in Fallout 4, or the Capital and Washington Monument in Fallout 3, exploring Independence Hall in Fallout 5 would fit in perfectly.\n\nAnd just like how Fallout 4 continues lore from Fallout 3, this would be a great opportunity for Bethesda to continue their self-contained part of this franchise, with returning characters and factions.\n\n6 Chicago\n\nA Trip To The Midwest\n\nLike the other great American cities on this list, Chicago's implementation lies largely in its deep-rooted history with the nation. Being tied to Ford's motorcar assembly plant, it would be amazing to see how this city in Illinois, largely bolstered by the post-war economy, could fit into Fallout's post-WW2 retro-future condition.\n\nBesides being an interesting American city on this list, Chicago's reputation in the Fallout universe has already been implemented with its importance for both the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave. This makes Chicago one of the top US cities that could definitely use the Fallout treatment.\n\nRelated\n\nMy Favorite Bethesda Game Is Still Fallout 4\n\nYou can always rely on the Minutemen.\n\n5 China\n\nLet's Finally Figure Out The Full Story\n\nChina was a key player in the 2077 Great War, which led to the nuclear condition of the world in Fallout. After WW2, China became one of the largest superpowers. With China mirrored to America in this new Cold War, it's clear they've always been integral to the Fallout lore.\n\nFor this reason, a game set in China could unfold much more of the underlying story that Fallout has been alluding to this whole time. With intrigue into what actually led to the bombs dropping, it's clear we've only been able to piece together the story from our sources in America.\n\nSo, even though developers would likely rather keep the games in America and a lot of the deeper lore hidden, a Fallout game in China has the potential to change everything.\n\n4 Seattle\n\nPotential For A Fallout Skyline with the Space Needle\n\nSeattle is a unique potential Fallout location for reasons unlike the others, as it has a huge amount of untapped lore potential. Other than simple geographic locations setting up for a storyline with the NCR, unlike many other States and Countries, there isn't too much we know about Seattle. With the Mod Fallout Cascadia in development, it's clear there is potential for this area as a setting.\n\nSo a Seattle Fallout game would have to do something we fans crave: create something almost completely new. New factions, settlements, and stories, set up around amazing geographical landmarks like the Space Needle, and the cold Pacific Ocean, make Seattle a gem of a likely Fallout location.\n\n3 Mexico\n\nA Fiesta For The Fallout Franchise\n\nOur interest in Mexico stems from similar factors to many other prospects: heavy pre-established lore and community interest. The Fallout: Nuevo M\u00e9xico mod is proof of community interest, and it's hard to shake how much influence this fantastic country has already had on the games.\n\nThere are huge connections to the NCR and New Vegas, with NCR Rangers commonly sent out to Mexico to patrol and claim land, similar to how they do in the Mojave. With a variety of potential new factions and a ton of great desert land for that traditional Fallout feel, Fallout in Mexico is one of the most exciting potential Fallout experiences.\n\nRelated\n\nCould A New Version Of Fallout New Vegas Be On The Way?\n\nThey asked me how well I understood theoretical games. I said I had a theoretical degree in games.\n\n2 New York City\n\nA Fallout Full Of Skyscrapers\n\nAs mentioned previously, Bethesda loves the north-eastern province of America. The beautiful Appalachian mountains and monuments in Washington, though, are nothing compared to the skyscraping potential of one of America's most powerful cities.\n\nWith the known presence of Mutants in New York mentioned by the Brotherhood in previous games, in New York, we'd have a lot of classic fun to look towards. Yet, it's difficult for many games to replicate New York for an important reason: the large city brings a subsequently large scope.\n\nYet, this is exactly what makes Fallout in New York so intriguing. The potential of what the developers pull from the ashes of a retro-future New York is unlimited, making New York a top contender for Fallout 5.\n\n1 Texas\n\nI Can See That Lone Star From A Thousand Miles Away\n\nFans want more Fallout in Texas, and we at DualShockers do, too. It's hard to shake the feeling that a game similar to Fallout: New Vegas would shine in the Lone Star State. With a great desert of oddities, lore, and that classic New Vegas western cowboy feel, we'd love to visit Texas in a Fallout game sometime in the future.\n\nSure, we've technically already been to Texas with the spin-off Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, but It's about time we re-established Texas as the true arbiter of the next Fallout game. If the assumed true ending of New Vegas was the NCR victory, then it's safe to assume we'd continue their story, with or against them, toward the east.\n\nIf a Texas project is given a chance, we hope the project is given to Obsidian. Regarding Obsidian's involvement in Fallout: New Vegas, Todd Howard has stated:\n\n\"there's only one group we trust to do this... It's either this group or nobody.\"\n\nObsidian consists of amazing storytellers connected to Fallout 1,2, and New Vegas, and we can't understate how important their involvement would be.\n\nWhile Fallout 5 is far into the future, whether from Bethesda in a game on the East Coast or given to Obsidian for the continuation of New Vegas, we hope, among them, Texas is highly considered for Fallout 5, or even a future Fallout project.\n\nFallout 4\n\n9/ 10\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nSystems\n\nOpenCritic Reviews Top Critic Rating:87/100 Critics Recommend:89%\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nEngine Creation\n\nESRB M FOR MATURE: BLOOD AND GORE, INTENSE VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, USE OF DRUGS\n\nX|S Enhanced No\n\nFile Size Xbox Series 51 GB (December 2023)\n\nMetascore 87\n\nPS Plus Availability Extra & Premium\n\nSteam Deck Compatibility yes\n\nCross Save no\n\nCross-Platform Play no\n\nExpand\n\nNext\n\nEvery Fallout Game Ever Released, Ranked\n\nThey say war never changes, but Fallout certainly has changed over the years.

The release of Fallout: London finally took place on July 25, 2024, but was accompanied by technical difficulties and various bugs that impacted the overall experience.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4 Player Finds Star Wars Easter Egg After Years of Playing\n\nA Fallout 4 gamer locates a unique Star Wars Easter egg in the Nuka-World DLC location after years of experience with the Bethesda game.\n\nIn response to these Fallout: London issues, the developers have issued a new statement on Discord. They expressed their amazement at the \"incredible support\" and enthusiasm from the community, highlighting how much their feedback and encouragement mean to the team. They outlined their plan to address the current problems, starting with a hotfix designed to resolve critical crashes and integrate essential systems like \"Buffout 4\" directly into the mod. They also noted that they had identified several other fixes to provide \"immediate\" improvements. The developers also mentioned they would clarify certain features that may not have been as effective as initially intended.\n\nUpcoming Fallout: London Patch to Resolve Quest-Related Issues\n\nClose\n\n\"The future is bright! We're already working on a HUGE patch that will address all the issues reported in our Discord, as well as a multitude of quest-related and other problems.\"\n\nAdditionally, Team FOLON is working on a \"huge patch\" to address reported problems, including quest-related issues and other gameplay concerns. The team plans to release the hotfix first to address immediate crashes and follow up with a substantial patch to resolve outstanding issues and enhance the overall experience. Additionally, they will also continue offering one-on-one troubleshooting sessions for users experiencing installation or crash problems, providing personalized support during this period. It's worth noting that Team FOLON previously committed to fixing Fallout: London crashes in a statement on July 29.\n\nWhile the impact of the upcoming Fallout: London patch remains to be seen, Fallout 4 has continued to see significant sales increases. In April 2024, it was the best-selling game in the United Kingdom, a surge attributed to the Fallout drama series and promotional discounts across various gaming platforms. It is also notable that, despite facing several issues, Fallout: London has a rating of 3.3/5 on GOG, which indicates a generally positive reception.\n\nFallout 4\n\nBethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, welcome you to the world of Fallout 4 - their most ambitious game ever, and the next generation of open-world gaming.\n\nAs the sole survivor of Vault 111, you enter a world destroyed by nuclear war. Every second is a fight for survival, and every choice is yours. Only you can rebuild and determine the fate of the Wasteland.

Actors like Clancy Brown, Ron Perlman, and Richard Dean Anderson could potentially reprise their roles in the Fallout TV adaptation. Fans eagerly anticipate possible appearances from famous actors such as Brad Garrett, Liam Neeson, and Danny Trejo in Fallout season 2.\n\nWith the success of Fallout season 1 owing largely to its memorable ensemble, gamers-turned-viewers are already speculating about which actors from the Fallout games could play their own characters in the show. Although the retrofuturistic world of Fallout remains the same throughout its many franchise entries, each game in the series takes place during different stages of Fallout's post-apocalyptic timeline and in various locations throughout the former United States. Set 219 years after the bombs drop, Amazon Prime Video's Fallout unfolds after all the franchise's preexisting games, making it perfect for cameo appearances.\n\nFor the most part, Fallout's cast of characters in season 1 were original personalities created for the show, from the ever-determined Vault Dweller Lucy (Ella Purnell) to the ruthless bounty hunter The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) to Brotherhood of Steel initiate Maximus (Aaron Moten). In Fallout season 1's ending, the show indicates that its sophomore outing will take place in New Vegas -- the setting for one of the most beloved games in the series. As a result, some of the Fallout series' most famous cameos could make the leap to the TV adaptation too.\n\n13 Clancy Brown Rhombus\n\nA prolific voice performer and live-action actor, Clancy Brown has appeared in everything from SpongeBob SquarePants to Shawshank Redemption. Set to star in Max's upcoming The Batman spinoff, The Penguin, Brown has also lent his talents to cult classics like HBO's Carnivale. In Fallout, Brown voices Brotherhood of Steel knight Rhombus, the Lost Hills chapter's head paladin. Stoic and gruff, Rhombus could easily be portrayed by Clancy Brown in the live-action series too, especially if the sophomore outing delves deeper into the Brotherhood of Steel's vision for the Wasteland.\n\nRelated Fallout Season 1 Review: Prime Video's Stellar Adaptation Leans Into The Offbeat & The Brutal\n\nPrime Video's long-awaited Fallout TV series adaptation knows its viewers well -- and it isn't afraid to give them a Vault Boy-style wink.\n\n12 Ron Perlman The Narrator / Butch Harris\n\nMost well known by Fallout fans for being the voice of the series' disembodied narrator, it's kind of shocking that Ron Perlman's voice didn't make it into the Amazon Prime Video adaptation, even if Perlman's most iconic Fallout quote did. The Hellboy actor voiced the opening and closing narrations for Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 76 and Fallout Tactics, though he also lent his talents to portraying onscreen characters, including Fallout's Butch Harris and a newscaster in Fallout 4. While the Fallout TV show is packed with Easter eggs, a Ron Perlman cameo is a must.\n\n11 Richard Dean Anderson Killian Darkwater\n\nThe mayor of Junktown in 2161, Fallout's Killian Darkwater also runs the community's general store and heads up their defensive forces. As the player character comes to learn during the game's side quests, Killian has a strong sense of \"frontier justice,\" making him a pretty compelling Wastelander. He's also voiced by a pretty compelling actor: Richard Dean Anderson, who's most well-known for playing the original MacGyver. Given the Fallout series' love of all things retro, and its on-point references to Hollywood and the entertainment industry, Anderson would be a fun get.\n\nRelated 11 Biggest Changes Amazon's Fallout Show Makes To The Video Games\n\nThe Fallout show serves as the newest canon entry to the franchise, but it also went back to change several elements of the established lore.\n\n10 Brad Garrett Harry\n\nComedian and actor Brad Garrett is pretty synonymous with the Ray Romano-led sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, though he's also lent his singular voice to animated projects like Finding Nemo and Ratatouille. While the post-apocalyptic Fallout may seem like a stretch for Garrett, his comedy chops could easily work for the show's dark humor and offbeat sensibility. Better yet, he's voiced Fallout's Harry, a super mutant stationed in the watershed in Necropolis. Although he's mentioned again in Fallout 2, Harry has yet to reappear in the series, but he'd be a great addition to the TV show's ensemble.\n\n9 Liam Neeson James\n\nThe Taken actor might be associated with his action roles and Star Wars appearances, but he also memorably voices the protagonist's father in Fallout 3.\n\nRelated Exciting Fallout Season 2 Update Makes Me Much More Confident About The Video Game Show's Future\n\nAfter Fallout's exceptional first season, I'm even more confident about its future after the Prime Video show's latest production update.\n\n1 8 Cree Summer Tandi\n\nA prolific voice actor, Cree Summer has actually voiced several characters in the Fallout universe.\n\n7 Danny Trejo Raul Tejada\n\nActor Danny Trejo crops up in plenty of action film fare, from Machete and Heat to Predators and Once Upon a Time in Mexico. However, he also has an incredibly memorable role in the Fallout series.\n\nRelated I'm So Glad Amazon Put My Biggest Fallout Season 2 Fear To Rest\n\nWhen it comes to the Emmy-nominated Fallout TV adaptation, our greatest fears about the sophomore outing have been addressed -- and it's great news.\n\n1 6 Malcolm McDowell John Henry Eden\n\nThe star of Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Malcolm McDowell has also appeared in Star Trek: Generations and the Halloween movie series. In Fallout 3, the actor voices John Henry Eden, an advanced ZAX AI unit installed in a military complex northwest of Washington, D.C.\n\n5 James Urbaniak Doctor 0\n\nWhile James Urbaniak has starred in searing comedies like Difficult People, the actor also appears in dramatic film and TV projects, from Christopher Nolan's Oscar-winning Oppenheimer to The Fabelmans. In the world of Fallout: New Vegas, Urbaniak voices Doctor 0, a pre-War scientist and member of the Think Tank operating in Big MT.\n\nRelated Fallout Continues A Positive Awards Trend After The Last Of Us Made Emmy History\n\nLast awards season, The Last of Us made Emmys history as an incredibly decorated video game adaptation, and, this year, Fallout continues the trend.\n\n1 4 Lynda Carter Magnolia\n\nThe original Wonder Woman, Lynda Carter voices Fallout 4's Magnolia, a singer who performs at a neighborhood bar called the Third Rail. A musician in her own right, Carter also recorded the songs \"Good Neighbor\" and \"Train Train\" for Fallout 4.\n\n3 Ashly Burch Tina De Luca, Rowdy Or Cricket\n\nOne of the stars of Apple TV+'s Mythic Quest, Ashly Burch is perhaps even more well known for her video game voice work. In addition to lending her talents to Fallout, the Emmy-winning Burch has voiced Aloy in Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, Chloe Price in the Life Is Strange series, Mel in The Last of Us Part II, and Tiny Tina in the Borderlands series.\n\nRelated Fallout Season 2's Setup Could Finally Force A Major Missing Faction Out Of Hiding\n\nA major faction currently missing from Fallout's TV show could be forced to reveal themselves after what happened in the season 1 finale.\n\n2 Ahmed Best Carver Timmerman\n\nIn 1999, Ahmed Best provided the voice and motion-capture performance for Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace's love-him-or-hate-him character, Jar Jar Binks. More recently, the prolific voice actor made a triumphant return to the Star Wars universe by portraying Jedi Kelleran Beq in The Mandalorian.\n\n1 Wayne Newton Mr. New Vegas\n\nOne of the most popular singers in the US during the 20th century, Wayne Newton has performed in Las Vegas, Nevada since the early '60s -- a feat that earned him the moniker \"Mr. Las Vegas.\" In a funny homage to Newton's success, the singer voices Mr. New Vegas in Fallout: New Vegas, an AI personality who serves as the city's DJ.\n\nFallout season 1 is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nFallout 4.0 Drama Where to WatchSeasonAllSeason 1 streamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n*Availability in US\n\nBased on the video game franchise of the same name, Fallout is a drama series set in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles.

While you wait, you can spend some time with this 327-piece Mega Fallout T-60 Power Armor Collection, which allows you to build 5 micro poseable Power Armor figures inspired by Fallout 4.\n\nThe set includes Vault Tec, Hot Rod Flames, Brotherhood of Steel Paladin, Military, and Rusted paint jobs with accessory options like Nuka Cola dark and a Hot Rodder magazine. To top it all off, the set comes packaged in a Vault Tec crate-inspired box. Pre-orders are available now here on Amazon for only $29.99, which feels like a bargain.\n\nWhat's next for Fallout on Prime Video?\n\nGiven the immediate positive reactions to Fallout, Prime Video was naturally greenlit for a second season before season 1 had even premiered. With the ending of season 2 leaving off in a place that indicates the Ghoul and Lucy will be making their way to New Vegas, fans are eager to see how the next events in the series unfold. The Fallout showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner provided an enthusiastic update recently stating they were \"pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible\". Even more recently, Amazon's head of TV Vernon Sanders told Variety that the team believes they're \"ahead of schedule\" in terms of when they'll be able to bring Fallout back to TV.\n\n\"We've been fortunate because this was the vision all along. I think we're ahead of schedule, in terms of being able to get Season 2 back,\" Sanders said. \"We don't have an exact launch date yet, but we've already gotten scripts in hand, and I think the fans of Season 1 will really love where we're going for Season 2.\"\n\nAs for the Fallout games, the Fallout 4 mod Fallout: London is now available to download for free. As you'd expect, Fallout: London takes players to the British city. Team Folon has set the mod 40 years before the events of Fallout 3, though it's important to remember this isn't a canon game, so don't expect it to be referenced in future mainline Fallout games. Players will have roughly 200 quests to complete as they venture through London and meet up with the mod's 20 Factions and seven new Companions.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Armor_(Fallout)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Power Armor (Fallout)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Elder Scrolls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fallout_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Fallout (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Robertson-Dworet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Robertson-Dworet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Character class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action-Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action-Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/08/07/81414fb5-818c-43ae-8ef5-9397e733248d/81ax1jdnvol-ac-sl1500.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Fallout 4, in particular, has received a lot of attention, with new players praising the game for its phenomenal world and storytelling. Considering that Fallout 4 is a great game, it should come as no surprise that the community is constantly churning out mods.\n\nSpeaking of mods, the Fallout London mod has gained a lot of attention recently. However, many players have run into issues. Since many players are facing crashes as soon as they start the game, this guide will cover everything there is to know about fixing Fallout London crashes, along with other useful information.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4 Mod Overhauls the Game's Movement\n\nA brand-new Fallout 4 mod modernizes movement in the game, bringing mechanics that some of the best action FPS games already have.\n\nFixing Fallout London Crashes\n\nFallout London can crash for different reasons, but most players have reported facing crashes after the train cutscene. Fortunately, all is not lost, as players can fix these crashes by following these simple steps:\n\nDownload the Buffout 4 mod from Nexus mods and place it in the Fallout 4 folder. Do not download any additional files when prompted. Look for the F4SE folder in the Buffout 4 zip file and copy it. Locate the F4SE folder in the Fallout 4 folder and replace it with the one from the Buffout 4 zip file. Now, locate the f4se_loader.exe file and launch the mod. Use this executable file every time you need to launch the mod. To make it easily accessible, create a shortcut on your desktop. When you want to start the mod, right-click on f4se_loader.exe and select Run as administrator. If you do not want to do this every time, access the compatibility settings in the Properties menu and tick always run as administrator.\n\nAfter following the steps mentioned above, you will not run into major crashes, especially after the train cutscene. But if you are facing issues due to the Weapon Debris setting, then download this mod to fix it.\n\nIf you continue to face crashes and you have tried all available workarounds, consider restarting your PC. If all else fails, consider switching your PC off and on again.\n\nFixing Infinite Loading Screen in Fallout London\n\nLike Fallout 4, Fallout London has long loading screens, but some players have reported being stuck on infinite loading screens. If you are facing similar issues, press ALT + Tab on the keyboard, and then press it again to return to the game.\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nSystems\n\nOpenCritic Reviews Top Critic Rating:87/100 Critics Recommend:89%\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nEngine Creation\n\nESRB M FOR MATURE: BLOOD AND GORE, INTENSE VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, USE OF DRUGS\n\nHow Long To Beat 27 Hours\n\nX|S Enhanced No\n\nPS Plus Availability Extra & Premium\n\nFile Size Xbox Series 36 GB (May 2024)\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_salman_shahid@gamerant.com", "name": "M.

Improve enemy AI with mods like the Commonwealth Encounter Pack and the Immersive Fallout Combat Mod. Balance gameplay by testing the new slide against challenging foes like Deadlier Deathclaws.\n\nGiven the amount of combat the average Fallout 4 player will see in a campaign, it just makes sense to install this mod which improves movement by making everything much smoother and more action-orientated. One of the most widely held beliefs regarding the fourth mainline game in the Fallout franchise is that while its role-playing elements feel underbaked, its combat is leagues ahead of every other installment. Having said that, it's still fairly clunky, especially when so many modern shooters have figured out how to handle movement through a first-person perspective.\n\nThanks to bp42s over on Nexus Mods, the \"Enhanced Movement\" mod adds a wealth of new features to Fallout 4 that make the game more fun to control. Many of the adjustments are minor but have a major impact on movement; Sprinting while outside of combat no longer drains AP while directional movement speed has been reduced by 25% when backpedaling and 15% when strafing. Yet the biggest addition is the ability to slide, which boasts a unique animation and allows the Sole Survivor to use their weapon in the middle of the action.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Fallout 4 Mods That Make The Game Feel Like The Fallout TV Show\n\nWhether it's realistic character models or environmental adjustments, these mods make Fallout 4 feel more like Prime Video's TV series.\n\nHow To Improve Fallout 4's Combat\n\nA Little Modding Never Hurt Anyone\n\nWhile it's true that Fallout 4's combat is much better than the likes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, it could be better. Beyond the clunky movement, enemies aren't especially difficult to defeat given that the AI running them isn't too smart, meaning they either stand in one place waiting to be shot or simply charge ahead with little self-preservation. There are ways to fix this as the modding community has had just under a decade to refine Bethesda's original combat mechanics.\n\nOne of the best mods Fallout 4 players can download to spice up combat is the Commonwealth Encounter Pack, which introduces an extra 290 random encounters to the vanilla game. Many of these can be tricky to overcome, making exploration and progression a more meaningful process. To improve enemy AI, the aptly named Immersive Fallout Combat Mod is exactly what's required as it makes foes more intelligent, enabling them to better flank and outmaneuver the Sole Survivor.\n\nThose Fallout 4 players wanting to put their new slide to the test can even do so against suped-up versions of the game's most challenging enemies thanks to the Deadlier Deathclaws mod. Having more realistic movements will likely already make the game much tougher, so it might be the case that installing more difficult mods could be a bridge too far. Finding the balance in battle is essential to enjoying the Commonwealth Wasteland.\n\nSource: bp42s/Nexus Mods\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_lang@screenrant.com", "name": "Brad Lang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence in video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_Mods", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nexus Mods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First-person (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_encounter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Random encounter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wasteland (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Science_Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Science Fiction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Shooter", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Shooter", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/untitled-design-37-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 3320, "textEnd": 3337}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

With your pockets empty and the lack of weapons and ammo in your possession, setting out can be as dangerous as it is thrilling.\n\nFortunately, there are a few things you can do to help you survive and thrive in London's wasteland. By prioritizing a few personal objectives, from finding useful weapons and allies to searching for a safe haven, you will be set up and ready to face the city's unchartered waters.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Biggest Fallout: London Changes & Differences\n\nFallout: London is a total conversion mod that has changed almost everything in Fallout 4 to give players the closest thing they can get to a sequel.\n\nFind A Weapon\n\nMelee Weapons Are More Common\n\nUnlike Fallout 4, where you're given a gun right off the bat, Fallout: London doesn't offer such liberties, and players must acquire one themselves while exploring. Moreover, melee weapons are far more abundant than firearms and ranged options, so you may have to rely upon these until you find your weapon of choice. There are some firearms you can still get early on in the game:\n\nScoped Hair Trigger Crude Gun\n\nTo obtain this weapon in Fallout: London, players must head northeast until reaching the River Thames, following the path to the Train Crash. You will know you're going in the right direction when you see a Layton Towers sign. From here, turn right and follow the road for a short distance.\n\nHead through the gap in the broken wired fencing to your left, going towards the edge of the river bank, where you'll see a large copper-colored pipe. Jump over the railing to enter the pipe, where you'll find a duffle bag and ammo container beside it. You can pick up x4 .32 Rounds, x11 9mm Rounds, and the Scoped Hair Trigger Crude Gun inside.\n\nFlare Gun\n\nAvailable to obtain within the first main quest in Fallout: London is the Flare Gun. The quest will lead you to encounter the Thamesfolk in Thameshaven, their underground hideout. Head northwest past the Fesco (inspired by the real UK supermarket, Tesco) to meet some guards, who suggest you take the southern entrance into a tube station.\n\nEnter and make your way through the flooded and radioactive tunnels until you find some chain alarms and a tin-can trap. On the right side, you will see a room containing a cooking station and a bed, showcasing that someone lived here. The Flare Gun is on the bedside table, along with a bunch of Flares for ammo.\n\nWhile it's not the best gun, with a slow fire rate, it will serve its purpose, considering that the alternative is to use your bare hands. Hold on to these until you find better options or vendors to purchase weapons from.\n\nCollect Tickets\n\nFallout: London's In-game Currency\n\nRather than Bottle Caps in Fallout 4, the primary trading currency in Fallout: London is Tickets, which are used to travel around London's Underground system. You will have picked up a few of these upon first escaping the lab through the station barriers and entering London Bridge Station within the tutorial.\n\nThese valuable orange tokens are abundantly scattered around the city wasteland and should be collected whenever spotted. Doing so will allow you to explore and get around London on the tube network and barter for items and useful gear with vendors.\n\nRelated\n\nHow To Adopt Churchill The Bulldog In Fallout London\n\nFallout: London features an adorable new companion in the form of Churchill the bulldog, who can be adopted early on into the mod's story.\n\nRecruit Companions\n\nSeven Companion Characters\n\nAs companions are a large part of the Fallout franchise, many players will want to recruit followers in Fallout: London, either for some good company or help in combat. Many of these NPCs offer engaging side quests in Fallout: London and storylines, so it is worthwhile searching for a few early on in the game. At the start, you can readily recruit three out of seven companions before progressing the main quest or joining factions to meet the rest.\n\nChurchill, The British Dogmeat\n\nFans of Fallout 4 will most likely be looking for their ever-loyal German Shepherd companion, Dogmeat, or another equivalent canine companion. Luckily, Fallout: London provides its version of the furry friend, Churchill, a British Bulldog. You can recruit Churchill early on as your first companion after escaping the lab.\n\nUpon surviving the train crash, you'll be met by a group of ruffians named the Vagabonds in Fallout: London, led by Sebastian Gaunt. Speak to them, and they will tell you about the Thamesfolk settlement, pointing you in its direction.\n\nHead north until you find Prilladog Food Factory, where you'll hear a guard yelling for some dogs to stop fighting. When you arrive at the scene, you'll see a bulldog, Churchill, fighting a group of mongrel dogs. To save Churchill, slaughter all the mongrels and speak to the guard, who will let you keep him as your pet.\n\nAside from being able to follow players or stay put, Churchill can do some nifty tricks at your command and even search the surrounding area for useful items. Overall, he is a great companion to take along with you on your apocalyptic adventure.\n\nArthur Mountbatten\n\nArthur Mountbatten is a friendly ghoul companion in Fallout: London who you can recruit early on while exploring the London wasteland, as long as you cross to the north side of the River Thames. To find him, travel to the northeast corner of the map, heading towards Hackney Way, where you will find a large gate.\n\nFrom here, head directly north from the Tower of London side of Tower Bridge. Then, make your way to the large concrete wall marked with the 'Hackney Checkpoint' glowing sign.\n\nBe careful as you approach, as you will see a group of hooligans along the wall to your right, which you must kill before going any further.\n\nArthur can be found strung upside down from a tree to the left of the wall. If you speak to him, he will ask the player to help him get down, triggering a dialogue option for you to free him. Upon doing so, you can invite Mountbatten to travel with you, but make sure your party isn't full if you want the ghoul in Fallout: London as your follower.\n\nMad Jack\n\nSimilarly to Arthur Mountbatten, Mad Jack is an accessible companion early on if you explore the north side of the River Thames, specifically near Trafalgar Square. Mad Jack is an extremely strong companion, befitting of a bodyguard who will keep you safe as a tank-based sidekick in post-apocalyptic London.\n\nYou can find him inside the basement of a pub called Pilgrim heading northwest from Trafalgar Square, going towards the bend facing Regent's Park. The pub is located along one of the side streets, around two roads away from the map's boundary.\n\nHead inside the pub and go towards the backdoor to find the lounge area leading into the underground Fight Club. You must speak to the fight manager to get Mad Jack's attention, which will put you in a fight against him, and you must survive for over a minute.\n\nThe only way to unlock Mad Jack as a companion character is to allow the fight between you to take place. Make sure you don't initiate combat until after the promoter makes the announcement, which will cause Jack to become temporarily hostile. To wrap up the quest, you don't have to beat him, but you must survive the fight, so reload the save if you face your demise.\n\nBuild Settlements\n\nUnlock Two Early Settlements\n\nAs with settlements in Fallout 4, those in Fallout: London make great trading hubs and safe player bases to call home among the terrors that await in the foreign apocalyptic wasteland. Setting these up around the map will allow you to create your own houses, recruit settlers, and store your valuable items and gear, which are important priorities to consider when starting the game.\n\nWhile each settlement provides unique benefits and advantages, along with useful allies, a few stand-out settlements are worth unlocking at the start of Fallout: London and are available almost immediately after the tutorial.\n\nLondon Bridge Settlement\n\nPlayers will be familiar with London Bridge, which is the first area they will reach after the tutorial. It is one of the best settlements in the game, as it is central to most points of interest around the map and has two access points. Moreover, it comes with Beefy, an ex-Beefeater, and six other settlers, who are running the toll bridge scam when you first meet them.\n\nWhile the settlement is easy to reach, you are required to pass a challenging Charisma (6) and Intelligence (5) Check, along with 10 Tickets to cross the bridge. If you speak to Beefy and pass these checks, he will request that you assassinate his former boss and clear the Beefeaters in the area. Accepting and succeeding in this side quest in Fallout: London will reward you with the London Bridge settlement.\n\nBiggin Hill Airport\n\nThe next best settlement to go to at the start of the game is Biggin Hill Airport, which is also available right after the tutorial, though it may take a little longer to acquire. carlosreyes11 on YouTube says to go directly west from Churchill Library and speak to the Tree Man named Gordo, the yoga teacher.\n\nIf you offer your help to the settlement, he will send you north to an underground bunker to take care of some hostile Dryads. Hack the terminal to get inside and take out the turrets along with the Dryads before facing a formidable Legendary Glowing One inside. Upon clearing these enemies, speak to the Synapse Tree and then report back to Gordo, who will tell you to return to him in a few days.\n\nTo avoid waiting to speak to Gordo again, you can find a bed and wait for two days, resetting your world time in the Fallout 4 mod . Upon returning to Gordo, he will grant you access to the Biggin Hill Airport Workstation and settlement, and you will be named Head Druid.\n\nSource: carlosreyes11/YouTube\n\nFallout

Team FOLON, the developer of the mod, says that a hotfix is coming soon to fix crashing issues that many players have reported, and that a large update will come soon after.\n\nTeam FOLON announced the move on its Discord (via Eurogamer). \"We have some big plans for the future, starting with a hotfix. This hotfix will address some crashes and include essential systems like 'Buffout 4,' which will be merged into the mod itself. We've also identified several other fixes that will provide immediate help...We're already working on a HUGE patch that will address all the issues reported in our Discord, as well as a multitude of quest-related and other problems.\"\n\nReleased in late July, Fallout London completely overhauls Fallout 4 and all of its DLC. The mod includes many of the elements you'd expect, including double-decker buses, red phone booths, and some of the global capital's more famous landmarks. It replaces the series' usual currency of bottle caps with Tube Tickets, and its version of London is comparable to Fallout 4's Boston in scope and scale.\n\nBut while the mod has garnered a warm reception from players, its stability issues have been noted by many, so it's good to hear that they're working on fixing them. In other Fallout news, Microsoft pointed to the success of the Fallout TV show as a major factor in Microsoft Gaming notching 500 million monthly players across all platforms.", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_t_wright@gamespot.com", "name": "Steven T.

You went from a dank cave filled with rats to a massive map you could explore in any direction, which was huge for 1997. Many Fallout games have replicated that feeling of leaving the vault in the years following, but the first still holds a special place in many hearts. Fallout Vault 13 is a brand new Fallout 4 mod that aims to recreate that moment - and the entire first game - and it's got a demo you'll be able to play surprisingly soon.\n\nFirst announced in 2021, Fallout Vault 13 is an ambitious mod for Fallout 4 which doesn't just plan to plonk the first game in the newer RPG, but to remake it entirely. A couple of years ago the modding team working on the project announced a demo but since then there's been a few periods of radio silence, with some assuming the project would never see the light of day. Despite that, the team has been busy behind the scenes, and now the demo is almost here.\n\nThe Fallout Vault 13 demo will give players the chance to explore an area called The Inyo. It encompasses Vault 13, Vault 15, and the budding settlement of Shady Sands - Fallout TV show watchers will no doubt remember that name. As this is a Fallout 4 mod, the team has had to build an entire wasteland to surround these areas complete with additional caverns and places to explore, some of which you can see in the Shady Sands Showcase released in 2022.\n\nPresumably there's been a lot of progress since then but even that earlier version of the village is familiar to anyone who's played the original Fallout. Seth, Aradesh, and Razlo are all present but Tandi is conspicuously absent, though admittedly this may be due to another quest from the original game. You can also grab a few glimpses of Vault 13 and Vault 15 here, as well as everyone's favorite radscorpion caves.\n\nFor me, I can't wait until the mod includes Junktown. Dealing with Gizmo has always been a favorite quest of mine, with multiple ways to complete it showcasing the flexibility and range of approaches possible in this apocalyptic title. The Master rendered with modern gaming graphics also promises to be a treat, as even in the 1997 original's art style he managed to become one of the creepiest villains in gaming.\n\nThe Fallout Vault 13 demo will be playable from Thursday August 8 from 6pm PDT / 9pm EDT / Friday August 9 from 2am BST / 3am CEST. You'll be able to grab the relevant download links from the dev team's Discord server.\n\nIf you're looking for something else, our guide to the best Fallout 4 mods will get you started, and our Fallout 4 console commands guide will help you get the most out of this post-apocalyptic RPG.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCGamesN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_mchugh@pcgamesn.com", "name": "Alex McHugh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_demo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Game demo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fallout_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Fallout (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rendering (computer graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/sites/pcgamesn/2024/08/fallout-4-vault-13.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 2580, "textEnd": 2588}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2621, "textEnd": 2629}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The demo will become available at approximately 9:00 PM Eastern Time.\n\nAs the title suggests, Fallout Vault 13 aims to recreate the first Fallout game in Fallout 4's engine. In other words, we're looking at a total conversion mod.\n\nFrom what we know, the playable area for the Fallout: Vault 13 demo will be roughly 1/3rd the size of the Commonwealth. This area will allow you to explore Vault 13, Vault 15, Shady Sands, The Khans, and numerous other new locations in the wasteland.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Fallout Vault 13 is to remake the entirety of Fallout 1. People will be able to explore all environments, both outdoors and indoors.\n\nThis mod, alongside Fallout London, is among the most ambitious fan projects for Fallout 4. So, we are curious to try the demo for Fallout Vault 13.\n\nThe modding team claimed that it will share the download link on its Discord server. So, if you are a fan of the first Fallout game, we highly recommend joining their server. I've also included below an older video from it, which will give you a glimpse at what the team aims to create.\n\nIf you are into Fallout 4, you might be interested in these other mods for it. For instance, there is a LOD mod that reduces distant objects/shadows/textures pop-ins. Then we have the Disk Cache Enabler Mod. There's also a mod that adds ragdoll physics and collisions to dead bodies. Another amazing mod is this one that fixes the game's long loading times. DirectHit is a mod that overhauls the AI of enemies. And let's not forget this mod that adds real locational damage to all enemies. A few days ago, we also shared this mod that adds to the game 10 driveable cars/vehicles with Havok physics.\n\nTo improve the graphics or performance, you can use the following mods. For instance, there are various HD texture packs. You can either download this 8K Texture Pack or this 41GB 4K Texture Pack which optimizes all 40,962 textures. There's also a mod that improves the faces of over 1450 NPCs. Finally, there is a mod that adds support for NVIDIA DLSS 2, AMD FSR 2 and Intel XeSS. Oh, and there's a mod that adds AMD FSR 3.0 Frame Generation to the game.\n\nLet's also not forget the DLC-sized expansion mods that you can get for F4. Fallout New Vegas Remake in Fallout 4 is an unreleased mod that we're really looking forward to. Then we have Fallout: Miami. America Rising 2 is another fan DLC/expansion mod that integrated the Enclave faction into the main story with 24 main quests. Caves Of The Commonwealth is another fan expansion that adds 2-5 hours of new gameplay content. Let's also not forget Fallout London which looks promising.

Team FOLON is working on a hotfix to address crashes and glitches, along with a future patch. Players experiencing issues with the mod can receive one-on-one tech support from the developers.\n\nFallout 4's expansive Fallout: London mod is one of the most impressive community-driven add-ons in recent memory, but developer Team FOLON wants players to know that it's working to improve the state of the game. Shortly after its launch, which was a long time coming after several substantial delays, Fallout: London stunned everyone with its attention to detail, writing, and dedication to delivering a familiar but unique experience. Unfortunately, the current version of the mod is riddled with bugs, a problem of which Team FOLON is very aware.\n\nPer PC Gamer, Team FOLON announced on its Discord that it's currently developing a hotfix that should alleviate many of the more pressing issues plaguing players. The main intention of the hotfix is to mend any problems causing severe crashes and game-breaking glitches while also adding a pre-existing mod to the package called \"Buffout 4.\" Said add-on has long been used to stabilize Fallout 4's engine, fixing several major bugs and adding a crash logger so Team FOLON is at least able to track certain breakages and prioritize removing them from Fallout London.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout: London Proves That One Mainline Fallout Trend Needs To Change\n\nFallout: London introduces a host of new content to players, and one inclusion is a reminder of the lack of diversity in one mainline feature.\n\nFallout: London Has A Bright Future\n\nTeam FOLON Is Working With The Community\n\nAside from the hotfix, Team FOLON also announced that it's developing what it describes as a \"HUGE\" patch that will fix prolific problems like floating objects and various quest-related bugs. There's no word yet on when this patch is expected to roll out but given the size of the team and Fallout: London's unstable nature, fans could be waiting for a while. Fortunately, the developer is offering another solution for those desperate to play the mod: One-on-one tech support.\n\nPlayers who join Team FOLON's Discord can request individual troubleshooting sessions with the developers if they're battling to access Fallout: London because of a bugged install or persistent crashes. That kind of dedication to working with the community is impressive, especially given that at the end of the day, this is a not-for-profit mod. If it wasn't already obvious, it should now be clearer than ever that Team FOLON is passionate about its creation and wants as many people to enjoy it as possible.\n\nThose players who have managed to dodge Fallout: London's rampant crashes and bugs have stated that the mod feels like a genuine piece of DLC forFallout 4. Many of the mechanics and systems are familiar to fans of the franchise but the new setting, weapons, and story make for a fresh change of pace. Since Bethesda isn't planning on setting a Fallout game anywhere other than the United States, it's fun to see a glimpse into a post-apocalyptic United Kingdom, even if it isn't canon.\n\nSource: PC Gamer\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nEngine Creation\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_lang@screenrant.com", "name": "Brad Lang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PC Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Expansion pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/untitled-design-53-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 3407, "textEnd": 3424}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

To be fair, I love all the Fallout games - I'm not looking at you, Brotherhood of Steel - sit down. Plenty agree, with it consistently ranking at the top among many fans of the series, so much it's pretty much become a meme at this point. That said, I wouldn't be a true Fallout New Vegas fan if I didn't admit that it's got some big problems, with tons of bugs that can get stuck in your craw unless you download the right mods. How it feels can also turn many away, but one modder has released a big animation overhaul that helps it feel much more up-to-date.\n\nMod maker Wombat has recently released the Enhanced Locomotion mod for Fallout New Vegas, and it's done wonders for the post-apocalyptic RPG. Overhauling all first-person animations, it makes the game feel slicker and smoother, with much less rigid movement. One of the core achievements with this mod is how it integrates with the existing New Vegas experience - animation lengths are maintained so the balance and gameplay remains unaffected, it'll just feel a heck of a lot better.\n\nIt doesn't take long using the mod or watching a video to pick up just how complementary yet revolutionary this mod is, especially if - like me - you've spent years of your life tucked away in the Mojave Wasteland. Weapon sway and how your character strafes, runs, and hops about feels much more naturalistic. You don't realize how static the game's movement once was until you see it changed, and now I wonder if I'll ever be able to go back to how it was before.\n\nHopefully this will help ameliorate some of the issues many Fallout fans have with the game, especially those weaned on later entries like Fallout 4 or Fallout 76. It's sometimes hard to check out an earlier title in the series and fully immerse yourself in it, especially when that experience is admittedly a little janky. Mods like this preserve the core experience while giving newer players a way in, and that can only be a good thing. With the Fallout 5 release date still hiding somewhere over the horizon, heading back to the series' high points is a great way to pass the time while you wait.\n\nIn addition to movement improvements this mod also fixes some animation-related issues that have plagued the game since release, such as the cessation of momentum when jumping sideways with a melee weapon.\n\nYou can head over to Nexus Mods to grab the full Enhanced Locomotion mod here, or if you're looking for something else our guide to the best Fallout New Vegas mods will surely be of assistance.\n\nShould you want to try a different direction, our list of the best apocalypse games on PC will help you find your next favorite game, and our best story games guide will find you that gaming narrative you crave.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCGamesN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_mchugh@pcgamesn.com", "name": "Alex McHugh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout: New Vegas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wasteland (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First-person (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mojave Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Realism (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 76"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_Mods", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nexus Mods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melee weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(subculture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mod (subculture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/sites/pcgamesn/2024/08/fallout-new-vegas-movement-mod.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The mod takes place in London, England, and players get to meet all kinds of interesting NPCs,\n\nWhile playing Fallout 4, players will quickly run into Dogmeat, arguably one of the best companions in the game. Thankfully, players will run into a Dogmeat in London as well, except this one is named Churchill, and he is an English Bulldog (the best option for the companion). Here's how to find him, recruit/adopt him, and then find him after dismissing him.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout London: How to Find a Settlement Early\n\nFallout London makes finding a safe place to store all your loot and build a base harder than Fallout 4, so here's how to find an early Settlement.\n\nWho Is Churchill In Fallout: London?\n\nClose\n\nChurchill is one of the many companions players can find and recruit in Fallout: London. Named after Winston Churchill, this dog takes on the role of Dogmeat while in London. He is an adorable English Bulldog who loves the player and is more than happy to explore the world of post-Great War London with them. He is also one of the best companions in the mod, just like Dogmeat was in the base game.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout London: All Factions (& How To Join Them)\n\nFallout London offers players different Factions. Here's how to join them all.\n\nHow To Find & Recruit Churchill In Fallout: London\n\nChurchill is found at the Prilladog Food Factory, which is actually found pretty close to the starting area (just like Dogmeat is). Once there, players will find Churchill being attacked by various stray dogs and will need to rescue him. Upon rescuing him, a nearby guard will get mad at the player for killing the dogs and will ask if they want to take Churchill with them since they have no use for him. Upon saying yes, the dog will follow the player just like any other companion in the game. From then on, the dog will follow the player until being dismissed; however, after being dismissed, players have had trouble finding the dog.\n\nRelated\n\nHow to Fix Fallout London Crashes\n\nIf you're having trouble with crashes while playing Fallout London, try these fixes.\n\nHow To Find Churchill After Dismissing Him In Fallout: London\n\nIf Churchill is dismissed, one of three things can happen. He can disappear from the game entirely, which is a known bug that the developers are working on fixing currently. Another option is that he can be replaced by Dogmeat, another known bug that is being worked on (and Nexus Mods has a fix for that). However, the final option, which is also the option that is supposed to happen, is that Churchill will end up at the docks near the ferryman on the northern part of the Thames. From there, he can be recruited again like normal.\n\nIf Churchill isn't at the docks, players may need to wait for the developers to fix the known bugs that are causing him to disappear.\n\nFallout 4\n\nSystems\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_rice@gamerant.com", "name": "Erin Rice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogmeat_(Fallout)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dogmeat (Fallout)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bulldog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_Mods", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nexus Mods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/08/fallout-london-churchill-split-image-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 3262, "textEnd": 3279}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

For the first time ever, players can explore what The Great War did to countries outside of the United States (at least from fans' perspectives; Bethesda is still tight-lipped about it).\n\nWhile the mod was only released on GOG, it is compatible with both the GOG and Steam versions of Fallout 4. This means that, thanks to players on the mod's Discord server, players can tweak things on their Steam Decks to allow the game to run on there as well. Here's a guide to doing just that on a Steam Deck.\n\nThis may seem like a difficult process, but it is easier than it originally looks.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout London: All Companions (& How to Recruit Them)\n\nThere are 7 available companions in Fallout London, but only 6 are recruitable in a single playthrough. Here's how to find and recruit them!\n\nHow To Download Fallout: London On A Steam Deck\n\nClose\n\nFirst, before players can get started with this process, they will need to make sure that they have the following on their Steam Deck (and the Steam Deck must be in desktop mode):\n\nFallout 4: Game of the Year Edition (the mod requires all the game's DLCs except for the High-Resolution Texture Pack) 200 GB of free space (thankfully, players only need this during the installation process) The Heroic Games Launcher (from the Discover Store) The Fallout: London Downgrader Tool from Nexus Mods (the Linux version is required)\n\nRelated\n\nAll Settlements & Their Locations in Fallout London\n\nFallout London has 6 Settlements (7 if you count a home). Here's how to find them all.\n\nOnce players have all of this done, they can then begin the process of actually downloading the mod. To do so, follow these steps:\n\nDownload the game Put the Steam Deck into desktop mode Use the Heroic Games Launcher to sign into GOG and \"purchase\" Fallout: London (the game is free, but it will still say purchase) Go to Heroic Games Launcher's library and install the mod Download the downgrader tool and extract it from the ZIP file it is in Load the tool, log into Steam, and select the location of the game (it is automatically /home/deck/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4/) Select the option to downgrade the version of the game Navigate to the folder with the mod and find the installer (the automatic location should be /home/deck/Games/Heroic/Fallout London/) Right-click on the installer and select the option to add it to Steam Go to Steam and change the installer's compatibility to Proton 9.0-2 (to do this, just go to the preferences menu for it) Launch the installer using the Steam shortcut option and navigate to where the game is installed (/home/deck/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4/) After the installation is finished, close the installer and bring over the game's INI files To do this, go to the /home/deck/Games/Heroic/Fallout London/_Config folder and find the 3 files labeled .INI Transfer those 3 files to the /home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/377160/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/My Games/Fallout4/ folder\n\nRepeat step 12 but with the files in the AppData folder To do this, go to the /home/deck/Games/Heroic/Fallout London/_AppData folder Transfer all those files to the /home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/377160/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/My Games/Fallout4/ folder\n\nMove the Fallout4.ini file to the launcher To do this, go to the /home/deck/Games/Heroic/Fallout London/_Config folder and find the file labeled \"Fallout4.ini\" Transfer that to the /home/deck/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4/ folder\n\nDisable Cloud Saving and play the game!\n\nFallout 4\n\nSystems\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_rice@gamerant.com", "name": "Erin Rice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Deck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steam Deck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Game_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.I.C.E.

Now that the team at VG247 has had enough time to wet their appetites and see what this highly-anticipated mod is all about, we decided to discuss and share a few of our favorite things across post-apocalyptic London.\n\nThe mod is, unsurprisingly, full of neat Britishisms (not that there's anything great about being British), and Easter eggs which are a real joy to experience. Sure, Fallout: London hasn't been without its fair share of bugs and crashes (which is authentic to the Bethesda experience, if you ask me), but this hasn't removed from the amazing amount of passion and detail that has gone into making Fallout: London a reality.\n\nWithout further ado, here are some of our favourite things in Fallout: London.\n\nMark Warren: \"What's a Gentry?\" my Fallout: London character, a mustachioed man built for sniping and not much else, asks the head in a jar. Jeremy Bentham, the founder of modern utilitarianism, stares back at me. His cold, dead, preserved eyes glare into my soul. WHAT did you just say, they seem to enquire. His protectron body should probably be punching me in the face with a metal limb.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nBecause Jeremy Bentham -- or rather his preserved corpse -- is a gentleman. He believes in healthy debate, and that's exactly what he was trying to have with me before I rudely defied the laws of stupidity. He slowly realises it's not worth it. I don't have any views on The Gentry, and even if I can cobble some together once he tells me what they are, they won't be worth hearing.\n\nHe politely brings the debate to a close, and as we part he hands me a cookie. I stand on the steps leading up to University College London, trying to process what's happened in the blur that was the last five minutes, after I spotted the robot and thought 'No way, it can't be'. Eventually, I bring up my inventory and have a munch on the cookie.\n\nMy dumb character might not be sure about the whole \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong\" thing that the philosopher's dead body is peddling. But I sure got a kick out of this bit of Fallout: London.\n\nJim Trinca: My favourite thing about Fallout London is a bold situational pun at the very opening: you. in a giant test tube, being examined by two doctors who are voiced by two Doctors. Specifically Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, the 6th and 7th titular stars of Doctor Who, most infamous for leading the show during its terminal decline in the late eighties.\n\nColin Baker's tenure was notoriously cack, and McCoy's, while a marked improvement, simply wasn't enough of a turnaround to save the show from its eventual cancellation in 1989. One of the main reasons cited for such was the unassailable quality of science fiction shows coming out of America at the time: particularly Star Trek: The Next Generation. The Brits, thought the BBC, simply cannot compete with shows that have actual money behind them.\n\nAnd there will never be an official installment of Fallout set in the UK, for it is an American story about how America sees itself. But the Brits have, somehow, knocked together something that holds up. Through endless hours of bedroom coding, the calling in of countless favours, and sheer tenacity, there is a British Fallout that's just as meaty as a real, mainline installment.\n\nAnd so I think the fact that the first NPCs you meet in this remarkable project are ex-Doctor Whos. The very ones in fact that presided over the original show's demise. It's a statement of intent: this is a proper game project with proper access to proper talent that you've actually heard of. And like all good British science fiction, we made it with two yoghurt tubs and a bit of string, and still managed to blow everyone away with its bold vision and eccentricity.\n\nAlso I haven't played past the opening.\n\nKelsey Raynor: Scrambling through post-apocalyptic London is pretty dangerous as it is. There's Hooligans, Gatherers, Beefeaters and all manner of ghastly, mutated creatures for you to be cautious of in Fallout: London. There's foxes with brutal bites, giant ladybugs that I felt awful killing, and scuttle crabs that square up to you.\n\nAn enemy I wasn't prepared for, however, was the Royal Mail. One of the few trusted mail delivery services in the UK -- that is actually reliable -- is far from reliable in Fallout: London.\n\nI walked past plenty of red post-boxes in my first few hours of the game without trouble. In fact, one of my earliest screenshots of the game is of a postbox. Nothing amazing, but I was certainly amazed to see one in Fallout for the first time. My amazement wore off when one of the things jump-scared me, however.\n\nThat's right. Some of Fallout: London's post-boxes aren't defunct relics from a time when posties' red vans were on every corner. No. Some of them have instead been turned into Post Boxers; post-boxes that'll jump out when you least expect it, conjuring wheels from beneath them and saws for hands.\n\nMy previous obsession with looting post-boxes in the hopes they'd have some money inside was quickly put to bed, and I have been avoiding post-boxes ever since. Though, there is a friendly one in Westminster to look forward to.\n\nKelsey Raynor: Sweeney Todd is a tale from the 1800s, detailing the life of a barber who'd murder his clients using his razor-sharp tools. He'd dispose of the bodies by handing them over to downstairs neighbor, Mrs. Lovett, who would then use these victims as ingredients for 'mystery meat pies'. It's quite grim, really, but so is post-apocalyptic London.\n\nIf you explore the streets surrounding St. Paul's Cathedral during the day, you can find Fleet Street, which is where Sweeney Todd resided. Take a wander down the road, and you'll actually see a barber shop led by a disheveled man called Ted. And would you look at that? His neighbor, Mrs. Miggins, happens to be a baker, and there's a corpse-shaped bin bag just outside... I wonder what they're both up to.\n\nExplore a little further, and you'll find a bucket of human remains behind Mrs. Miggins counter.\n\nThe interaction sadly doesn't consist of much more than Ted actually giving you a haircut and his baker neighbor being a trader, but it's still quite neat to see the old, gruesome tale brought to life in Fallout: London.\n\nMark Warren: Yes, all of my bits are about Protectrons designed to mirror iconic Brits. Look, I'm a New Vegas fan, robot fetishism kinda comes with the territory.\n\nAnyway, getting back on track, John Bercow's cameo in Fallout: London is a little thing, but it's a perfect example of the mod going that extra mile to deliver an experience that feels authentically English, complete with all of our bonkers traditions and bizarre sense of humour.\n\nAs you'll see if you're from another part of the world and you play the mod, we're a nation - establishment-wise at any rate - committed above all else, in a frankly psychopathic fashion, to the notion of order. Of everyone doing what they're told. At least in theory, those rules obviously often don't apply to those at the top, at least in any terms beyond appearance.\n\nSo, having a man in there literally known for shouting 'Order!' at MPs during his time as speaker is just chef's kiss. And it's quite funny too.\n\nKelsey Raynor: In case you hadn't heard, the UK and other parts of Europe were at the center of quite the scandal in 2013. A scandal involving horse meat. That's right. Folk across the country were buying 100% beef burgers and God knows what else only to later have it revealed that these food products did, in fact, have traces of horse DNA inside them. It also happened that Tesco was at the forefront of the scandal, while other stores such as Aldi and Lidl were also affected.\n\nWhile consuming horse meat isn't actually a health risk, this did cause a lot of understandable concern about how horse DNA ended up in our food. If that could happen, what else was ending up in our food that we didn't know about?\n\nAnyways, if you explore the aptly-named Fesco in Fallout: London, you can find 'Meat Mix Burgers' which have all manner of animals on the packaging. One of them, of course, is a horse, which is undeniably a gentle poke at the food-safety concerns of Brits during 2013 and the meme that the whole scandal later became.\n\nFallout: London has a lot of niche references like this, which is what makes the mod so brilliant. Take the random NPC's in Westminster that talk about napping in Parliament, for example. That actually happened. If you explore every inch of Fesco, too, you'll also find some controversial Warmite.", "source": {"uri": "vg247.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VG247"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Things are going swimmingly.\n\nBetween checking shelves for food and medical supplies, I cut down the occasional oversized fly for some minor XP before noticing a small opening along the wall in the distance. I walk over, hoping to find a computer terminal or a freezer with even more rations to take with me. As I round the corner into the opening, what greets me instead is the absolutely enormous thorax of a creature I've never seen in my cumulative 300 hours of playing Fallout games. I backpedal as it turns towards me and behold just how badly I screwed up. This is The Bloatmother. It's five times my size and doesn't look happy about what I've been doing to her babies.\n\nI clumsily swap my switchblade for the 9mm pistol I found a few blocks away. I use the V.A.T.S. to line up three of the 17 shots I have and fire. The first two ricochet off its hardened body. The third finds flesh, but barely makes a dent in the beast's health bar. The Bloatmother fires a volley from its pinchers, but before it can hit me I hit the pause button and walk away from my Steam Deck.\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\nTense moments like these are the early highlights of Fallout: London, the ambitious unofficial Fallout 4 expansion from Team FOLON. These superb moments of terror are punctuated by the mystery that pervades this post-apocalyptic city. Players are a long way from the familiar wastelands of America, and Fallout: London reminds them of that often.\n\nI haven't had such a raw, guttural reaction to Fallout's brand of body horror since I first crossed paths with Centaurs in 2008.\n\nThe Fallout franchise has been around for 27 years. In that time, its enemies, factions, and fiction have become iconic in gaming (and now television). While the grit and grime of the Fallout universe remain effective, there is comfort in walking around an America ravished by nuclear fallout all these years later. There's nostalgia in shooting Rad Scorpions in the Mojave Wasteland to the tune of the oldies. Three-Dog's charming interstitials recounting the horrors of post-apocalypse Washington D.C. make me feel at home.\n\nThose luxuries don't exist in Fallout: London. Setting the game in the European metropolis has wiped the slate clean, allowing Team FOLON to reintroduce and reimagine the franchise, and subvert players' expectations.\n\nThere are brand-new creatures in the wild with new attack patterns, animations, and gross mannerisms. Returning enemies look slightly different and are tougher than ever. And the setting is refreshing, with London extending a new coat of paint to its factions and people.\n\nBethesda's games have always looked at how pre-apocalypse culture gets re-interpreted by those hundreds of years in the future following humanity's downfall, and Fallout: London is no different. Camelot, a gang inspired by 20th-century soldiers and The Knights of the Round Table, adds a dash of righteous camp not seen since New Vegas' charming gang of Elvis impersonators. The Gentry are the descendants of the English aristocracy, an interesting, slightly more civilized twist on the antagonistic patriarchy of Cesar's Legion. Seeing how a nuclear apocalypse and time have warped English culture is fascinating, a credit to Team FOLON's world-building.\n\nThe marriage of Fallout 4's more modern gameplay and New Vegas' exemplary role-playing mechanics is a match made in heaven.\n\nMy favorite of the new groups is the Thamesfolk. While I won't spoil their reveal here, I'll say their visage inspired a need to learn everything I can about the origins of these people and exactly how radiation changed them so irrevocably. I haven't had such a raw, guttural reaction to Fallout's brand of body horror since I first crossed paths with Centaurs in 2008.\n\nWhat brings Fallout: London's mystery full circle is its difficulty. Enemies are not messing around and can slaughter players in an instant. Radiation is an ever-present threat players must be mindful of, making meds like Rad-X and Radaway invaluable. These elements add a sense of risk-reward to discovering factions, locations, and creatures.\n\nIn other words, Fallout: London is a must-play. The marriage of Fallout 4's more modern gameplay and New Vegas' exemplary role-playing mechanics is a match made in heaven, one that occasionally surpasses Bethesda's 2015 game.

The Easter egg was found in the Nuka-World DLC location, hinting at more surprises for players exploring the Fallout 4 world. Bethesda's development of Fallout 5 may bring even more Star Wars Easter eggs to the franchise in the future.\n\nA Fallout 4 player has discovered a Star Wars Easter egg depicting one of the game's characters frozen in carbonite. Fallout 4 has countless Easter eggs hidden around its open world, and this may be the smallest Star Wars one.\n\nSince Fallout 4 was released, players have discovered tons of Easter eggs around the open-world Boston commonwealth. Among the Fallout 4 Easter eggs found by the community are a Terminator 2 code in The Institute, Jaws references on various boats, and an Experimental Plant that closely resembles Skyrim's Nirnroot. While the game has been out for many years, gamers continue to discover these details, highlighting how well some of them are hidden. After years of playing, one gamer has found a character frozen in carbonite just like Han Solo was in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4 Player Builds Donut Shop in Sanctuary\n\nA talented Fallout 4 player online builds a cozy donut shop in Sanctuary, making great use of the game's settlement-building features.\n\nReddit user Sensitive_Underwear recently shared a Fallout 4 clip highlighting their discovery of a Star Wars Easter egg. The player explores a Disciple base in Fizztop Mountain, which is found in Nuka-World, one of the Fallout 4 DLC locations. The video begins with the gamer walking behind a burnt-out fire pit with a Toy Alien on it to discover a small rectangular figure with a bizarre shape in the middle. After using a weapon to zoom in on the item, it becomes obvious that it's a reference to Star Wars' Han Solo when he's frozen in carbonite. The character frozen in the stone tablet resembles Deacon, one of the Railroad faction members. As Deacon can be found in different locations, this distinct character may simply share the same character model.\n\nThis Gamer Found a Star Wars Easter Egg in Fallout 4\n\nIn Star Wars, Han Solo is frozen in carbonite by Darth Vader to be transported to Jabba the Hutt by Boba Fett. Because no quests explain which character is frozen in the same position, it's unclear what their role in the Nuka-World DLC is. As the recommended level to start the Fallout 4 DLC is 30, low-level players may have to increase their stats before finding this Star Wars Easter egg themselves. Given that it was found in Nuka-World, the object may only be available to DLC owners. Beyond this Star Wars reference, one of Obi-Wan Kenobi's famous lines is paraphrased on the U.S. Covert Operations Manual's cover.\n\nClose\n\nAs more players explore Fallout 4, new Easter eggs may continue to be revealed. Bethesda has confirmed that it's developing Fallout 5, which may indicate that there could be more Star Wars Easter eggs in the future release.\n\nFallout 4\n\nBethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, welcome you to the world of Fallout 4 - their most ambitious game ever, and the next generation of open-world gaming.\n\nAs the sole survivor of Vault 111, you enter a world destroyed by nuclear war. Every second is a fight for survival, and every choice is yours. Only you can rebuild and determine the fate of the Wasteland.

The Strength stat in Fallout: London is crucial for melee builds, increasing damage and carrying capacity for players. Investing in Perception improves VATS accuracy, helps detect enemies, and is essential for ranged combat and spotting loot.\n\nFallout: London is a complete makeover mod for the popular role-playing game, Fallout 4. The mod was in development for five years before being released in July 2024. As the name suggests, the gameplay takes place in the City of London, England.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4: Children of Atom, Ranked\n\nThe Children of Atom make a major comeback in Fallout 4's Far Harbor DLC. Here are the best of them, ranked.\n\nThe Fallout: London mod relies on the mechanics of the base game, layering a new map, environment, and story on top. This means that players need to understand what each stat is, the impact they can have on gameplay, and where to put attribute points for specific builds. It is easy to make a mistake during character creation, and end up with a set of stats that simply don't work.\n\n7 Strength\n\nImportant For Melee Builds\n\nIncreases carrying capacity Increases melee damage\n\nStrength is one of the seven stats in Fallout: London. As one may imagine, the Strength stat is a measure of a character's physical ability. Investing attribute points into strength is vital for players who intend to go with a melee build.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4: 10 Best Unique Weapons & How To Get Them\n\nWhile unique weapons in Fallout 4 aren't easy to come by, they are also very powerful, and these unique weapons are worth the effort to track down.\n\nStrength has two primary benefits in Fallout: London. Firstly, for every point invested in Strength, the player will do an additional 10% melee damage. Secondly, for each point spent in Strength, the player can carry an additional 10 weight. Even players who do not intend to use a melee weapon might find a couple of points in Strength useful, just for the extra carrying capacity.\n\n6 Perception\n\nBe More Aware Of The Environment\n\nImpacts VATS accuracy Detect enemies more easily\n\nPerception is the main stat that Fallout: London players who want to specialize in ranged combat will want to invest in. Some builds, such as a sniper build, rely on high Perception to be able to target specific body parts when using VATS from long range.\n\nAdditionally, higher Perception makes it easier to spot lootable items and enemies in the environment. This combines well with a ranged damage build, as enemies will be spotted from much further away, and can be engaged at range before they spot the player. Another benefit of a high Perception statis that it will greatly improve the player's skill at lockpicking.\n\n5 Endurance\n\nMore Health And Stamina\n\nIncreases hit points Longer sprint duration\n\nEndurance is a stat in Fallout: London that every player needs to take a close look at. It is crucial for building a character that has at least some level of survivability. The main benefit of putting points into Endurance is that it will increase the number of hit points the player has.\n\nHowever, Endurance has a couple of other important benefits. Firstly, the more stamina a player has, the longer they will be able to sprint for. Secondly, radiation resistance is increased by spending points in Endurance, which can be very useful when exploring the open-world map.\n\n4 Charisma\n\nOften Overlooked But Useful\n\nHelps to get better prices with vendors Assist with colony management\n\nCharisma is, in general, a non-combat stat. Many players that enjoy Fallout: London as a quest-based, FPS game will likely ignore the Charisma stat completely. However, players that enjoy the RPG aspects might like to consider spending some points in Charisma.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4: 8 Worst Settlements\n\nFallout 4 introduced player settlements to the series, bringing new ways to interact with the world. But some locations are a mistake.\n\nWhen completing quests, high Charisma has a chance of helping get past speech checks. Charisma is also checked when issuing commands to a companion; the higher a player's Charisma, the more likely a command will be successful. Additionally, higher Charisma makes it easy to attract new dwellers to a settlement and manage them.\n\n3 Intelligence\n\nDirectly Impacts Experience Point Gains\n\nIncreases experience point payout Makes crafting and modding items more effective\n\nMost Fallout: London players will want to put at least a few points into the Intelligence stat, simply for the fact that the higher a player's Intelligence, the more experience points they gain for every applicable activity.\n\nHowever, Intelligence is also useful for players who enjoy crafting their own gear, and modding weapons and armor, as well as crafting their own consumables such as medication and explosives. Lastly, hacking is impacted by a player's Intelligence, with higher Intelligence leading to a better chance of a successful hacking.\n\n2 Agility\n\nGreat For Stealth Gameplay\n\nImproves sneak ability Adds action points for VATS\n\nFallout: London rewards players who want to rely on a stealth build by presenting plenty of opportunities to use the sneak ability tactically. Agility is the primary stat that impacts the player's sneak ability, and is therefore vital for stealth builds.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4: 7 Items You Should Never Sell To Merchants\n\nWhile some items are completely fine to sell for extra Caps in Fallout 4, these are ones that you should hold onto.\n\nFurthermore, the higher a player's Agility, the more action points they will have available to spend while using VATS. On top of this, the player's movement speed is driven by their Agility. Overall, Agility is a powerful stat that can have a massive impact on gameplay, especially for sniper or assassin-style builds.\n\n1 Luck\n\nWe All Need A Little Luck Now And Then\n\nIncreases crit chance Impacts loot quality\n\nThe Luck stat should not be overlooked by Fallout: London players. It has an impact on many of the core gameplay mechanics, providing either overt or hidden benefits in many scenarios. In combat, Luck directly impacts critical hit chance, and can also randomly mitigate certain negative effects.\n\nThe higher a player's Luck stat, the more chance they have of finding more loot, and better grade loot as well.

Unfortunately, that hasn't included a Lego collaboration, but there is an upcoming Mega Bloks building kit that looks pretty darn cool while also maintaining a very reasonable price. The Fallout T-60 Power Armor Collection is available to preorder now at Amazon for only $30 ahead of its November 20 release. Considering the popularity of the Fallout this year, we'd recommend securing a preorder if you're interested in buying the set for yourself or as a holiday gift.\n\nThis 327-piece set comes with five posable T60 suits, all based on designs from Fallout 4. You're getting Vault Tec, Hot Rod Flames, Brotherhood of Steel Paladin, Military, and Rusted paint jobs, and each figure comes with an accessory like a box of Sugar Bombs breakfast cereal. Admittedly you won't be doing a lot of construction here, as you're only building rigs for the figures to rest in, but once everything has been assembled and put together, the end result looks impressive. This even comes in a Fallout 4 crate-inspired box, for that extra touch of authenticity.\n\nIf you're looking to build a Fallout shrine with some more collectibles, the McFarlane Movie Maniacs line has some great options. You can pick up a three-pack of figures for $110, and this includes Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus from the Fallout TV series. Each figure boasts a high level of detail, screen-accurate colors, and they come with display bases to pose them on. Or if you want to build your own Brotherhood of Steel, Maximus figures are $59 each at Amazon.", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_bonthuys@gamespot.com", "name": "Darryn Bonthuys", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mega Brands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Armor_(Fallout)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power Armor (Fallout)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fallout_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Fallout (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-60_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-60 tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_T60", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooper T60"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Character class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghoul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_cereal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breakfast cereal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Terrain", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Terrain", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1601/16018044/4346776-power-armor-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-20", "textStart": 51, "textEnd": 62, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

New players must scavenge for weapons in London Shard, finding Molotov and Cane early on. Progressing in the game leads to more weapons like the Balisong, flare gun, 9mm pistol, and service rifle.\n\nSome mods for Fallout 4 simply tweak the gameplay mechanics. Others add new items such as weapons and armor. But there are some mods that entirely transform the game, and Fallout: London is such a mod. This is a total makeover of the original game with its own storyline, open-world map, and unique items.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4: 10 Best Unique Weapons & How To Get Them\n\nWhile unique weapons in Fallout 4 aren't easy to come by, they are also very powerful, and these unique weapons are worth the effort to track down.\n\nNew players to the Fallout: London mod will notice very quickly that they are not spoon-fed an easy playing experience. They are not given a weapon, or any consumables such as blood bags or food for healing. They must progress some way before being so equipped. However, there are a few basic weapons that can be found within the first hour or two of play in this post-apocalyptic RPG.\n\n7 Molotov\n\nSave It For The Radshrews\n\nWeapon Stats: Damage: 51 Fire rate: 0 Range: 93 Accuracy: 0\n\nOnce a new player in Fallout: London has managed to leave the lab, where the new player tutorial takes place, they will find themselves in the London Shard. This is a liminal area that acts as a transitional zone between the tutorial and the game proper.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4: 8 Worst Settlements\n\nFallout 4 introduced player settlements to the series, bringing new ways to interact with the world. But some locations are a mistake.\n\nThere are a few useful items to be found in this zone, and one of these is a single Molotov cocktail, which is thrown like a grenade. It can be found inside the public toilets on the ground floor. This is well worth picking up, as shortly after, the player encounters a large group of roaches, and will likely have no other weapon at this stage.\n\n6 Cane\n\nSteal It From The Skeleton\n\nWeapon stats: Damage: 15 Speed: Medium\n\nOnce a Fallout: London player has worked out how to leave the London Shard, they will find themselves in London Bridge Station. Just as the player enters this area, they will spot a skeleton sitting on a bench.\n\nLeaning against the skeleton's arm, is the cane. This is a basic melee weapon, but good enough to take out the odd roach or radshrew in a pinch. It works well until the player gets the next weapon on this list, at which time it becomes superseded.\n\n5 Balisong\n\nA Cool Trick Knife\n\nWeapon stats: Damage: 14 Speed: Fast\n\nOnce a Fallout: London player has discovered a way out of London Bridge Station, they will find themselves in the Lewisham area. At the start of this zone, the player will meet a group of three NPCs, who are part of a local gang.\n\nIf the player chooses to hang with the gang, they are awarded with the Balisong, which is a cool butterfly knife that can be used as a weapon and to do tricks. It doesn't do a lot of damage, but it has a fast attack rate, and is useful in the early part of this role-playing game.\n\n4 Flare Gun\n\nMinimal Ammo But Useful\n\nWeapon stats: Damage: 9 Fire rate: 3 Range: 35 Accuracy: 74\n\nFollowing the main story arc in Fallout: London, will send the player to the Thamesfolk quite early on. This faction lives in a warren of underground tunnels, which the player can explore and loot. One location that will be discovered is an old tube station, which is where the flare gun is located.\n\nThe player needs to continue along the tunnels until they come to a series of alarms that have been set up using some old cans. This guards a place that has been inhabited at some stage, and inside is a sleeping room with a bed and a bedside table. On that table is the flare gun and a few flares to use for ammo.\n\n3 9mm Pistol\n\nDon't Miss This Weapon\n\nWeapon stats: Damage: 16 Fire rate: 66 Range: 83 Accuracy: 61\n\nThe first hour of Fallout: London will generally involve a player using their fists to fight off radshrews (much like radroaches). And with little in the way of healing consumables to loot, this can be a problem for some builds. But there is a 9mm pistol available quite early in the game, that many players might miss.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4: Best Items To Get in Far Harbor\n\nEvery DLC for Fallout 4 added a variety of new items for players to acquire, and here are the ones in Far Harbor that players should focus on.\n\nOnce the player has found their way down to London Bridge Station, they will need to use a ticket to open the ticket gates to the platforms. However, just before these ticket gates is a derelict shop. Inside that shop is a serving counter, and below that counter is a small safe that can be picked. Inside is a 9mm pistol and a limited amount of ammo.\n\n2 Service Rifle\n\nIt's A Smelly\n\nWeapon stats: Damage: 33 Fire rate: 4 Range: 215 Accuracy: 73\n\nThe service rifle is modeled on the Short Magazine Lee Enfield (SMLE), or as British Tommy's called it in both World Wars, the Smelly. This rifle is available very early in the game, close to the location of the 9mm pistol in London Bridge Station.\n\nTo the right of the ticket booth in the station, is the preservation center, with a locked door that can be opened by a player with enough strength. Inside is the service rifle. It doesn't do a lot of damage, but it is useful until better options are available.\n\n1 Longsword\n\nNot Quite Excalibur\n\nWeapon stats: Damage: 33 Speed: Medium\n\nMelee players who are willing to befriend the Arthurian Knights faction, can gain access to the longsword quite near the start of Fallout: London. However, not until they have completed the Thameshaven zone.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Best Fallout 4 Mods, Ranked\n\nFans of Fallout 4 have been making mods for the title ever since it was released. Here's a look at some of the absolute best of the best, ranked.\n\nOnce they have, they can locate the Swan and Mitre pub, and close by is a building with a lot of roaches. Inside this building is the usual junk loot, but also the longsword. Later, if the player stays with the Arthurian Knights faction, they gain access to some matching armor as well.\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nOpenCritic Reviews Top Critic Rating:87/100 Critics Recommend:89%\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mac_wheeler@gamerant.com", "name": "Mac Wheeler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Open world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Molotov cocktail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butterfly knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flare gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9\u00d719mm_Parabellum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "9\u00d719mm Parabellum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Bridge_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London Bridge station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Service rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grenade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medium (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4:_Far_Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4: Far Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melee weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewisham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewisham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lewisham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Arthur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/08/fallout-london-best-early-game-weapons-ranked.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 6433, "textEnd": 6450}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Not only will boarding the train to navigate apocalyptic London likely lead to your game crashing, but it will also cause a strange bug that halves players' HP.\n\n\"The issue with the train crash is quite a known one, and it's been reported on quite a lot,\" project manager Dean Carter says in an interview with VG247. \"We never had that. We wouldn't have released if we had that. None of our testers had that. So we're not sure if something actually happened with the final upload or something, but it's those sorts of ones that have been a bit of a surprise to us.\"\n\n\"You put your heart and soul into anything, and eventually you sort of realise, no matter how hard you've worked, everything's held together with duct tape. So, [Fallout: London's] held together better than we thought, but lots of the issues that we've had, or people have been reporting rather, they're not ones that we had.\"\n\nFallout: London devs Team FOLON has promised to release a huge hotfix ASAP, but in the meantime, the only solution for the HP bug after the train crash is to complete some math homework.\n\n\"I believe the order we're going to do it in will be a hotfix that should basically include things like [the] Buffout 4 [mod],\" Carter says, \"So, the sort of systems that people have said are almost a requirement to run, we went and got permission for those. We didn't have permission before, which is why we never really mentioned them, and they were things that people had to go and get. Since we've released, obviously, they're more inclined to want to work with us now, so now we're gonna do a hotfix that should include things like Buffout 4, which will help stability and those issues.\"\n\nSome of the issues can be remedied pretty easily without the help of a hotfix. If you encounter a problem, then the first port of call should be to check out the Solutions Megathread that Team FOLON put together. Sometimes, crashes and bugs can occur by not following the correct download steps.\n\n\"The biggest gripe that we've had is when people have installed things wrong, and then they have stated that it's our fault,\" Carter says. \"We know it's not the easiest install on Steam. We do understand that, and we have tried our best.

With the upcoming Milepost Zero update, which is currently in public testing, Bethesda is cracking open its crafting system in a bold new fashion. Ahead of its full release, PCGamesN sat down with lead producer Bill LaCoste and creative director Jon Rush to discuss the change and what it means for the future of the revitalized multiplayer RPG.\n\nThe Fallout 76 Milepost Zero update is making some smart improvements to the six-year old Bethesda survival game. It's changed a lot in that time, from that notorious, much-maligned launch to the modern day, where it's become what might be the most fun way to spend time in the Fallout universe. Now, Milepost Zero is taking the next step, with new features that are the perfect way to fill downtime between events and daily ops.\n\nAnother key change that will likely cause even more dramatic shake-ups is the new legendary crafting system. Put simply, this is a much more open-ended way to approach putting Fallout 76's most powerful, build-defining mods onto items. Previously, getting your hands on the best legendary mods to create the ultimate gear has been a largely random process, requiring you to gamble valuable resources to craft an item and hoping that you hit the specific effect you want on it.\n\nThat's all changing in Milepost Zero. Now, every time you scrap a legendary item there's a small chance that you'll learn the ability to craft one of the legendary mods it bears, in much the same way that you unlock crafting for standard mods. Once you've picked up the skills to make a specific legendary mod, you'll be able to build modules for it at the Tinker Bench using legendary particles (earned from the scrapping process), and then either apply them to weapons and armor, or sell them through your camp shop to other players.\n\n\"Really the crux of the decision was to rely less on an exclusively RNG experience to get that gear that you want,\" Rush tells me. \"Our players have specific playstyles they want to adhere to, and they want the gear to be able to support that. So what this does is it gives players agency - rather like a little tiny light at the end of the tunnel. So you can at least see what you're progressing towards; where you want to go.\"\n\n\"What's also kind of cool is it also sort of opens up a whole new economy in the game,\" Rush continues. \"So, okay, I scrapped something and - oh - now I know how to create Bloodied mods. Well, I'm rich now!\" For those out of the loop, 'Bloodied' refers to a particularly popular legendary modifier that amplifies your damage when your character's health is low, and is core to many players' favorite builds - including mine. As such, the idea of being one of the first players to learn the ability to make and sell ready-to-cook Bloodied mods to others is rather enticing.\n\nI'm certainly convinced by the proposal. As someone who's poured hundreds of hours into Fallout 76, I reached a point where I had an almost perfect loadout for the build I wanted. Unfortunately, that meant that unless I completely swapped it out for something different (which would itself necessitate many more hours of starting from scratch), the chance of getting any upgrades on my gear was so slim that it didn't feel worth pursuing further.\n\nWith this new legendary crafting system coming into action in Milepost Zero, those upgrades feel like they might feasibly be attainable. Plus, as I also discussed with Rush and LaCoste, the new Fallout 76 caravan routes are a great way to make sure you aren't just left sitting around waiting for some action. Perhaps it's time to strap on the power armor once again and get to work.\n\nIf that's not enough to keep you busy, check out our Fallout London review to see if the ambitious fan-created project is worth your time.

This mod takes players through the streets of London, England as the Wayfarer, the mod's equivalent of the base game's Sole Survivor.\n\nAlong the way, players will meet several different companions, join some factions, and even start some settlements.

Additionally, players should consider which one of the settlements they want to spend the most time on, because working on all of them at once can really spread resources thin. A lot of players have noted that the Covent Garden or Vuaxhall Grove Construction Site are the two best settlements.

The mod takes players around the streets of London and lets them see the historic city in Fallout fashion.\n\nWhile roaming the streets of London, players will be asked to take on the Bank of England during the Heavenslayer quest, which is a pretty important quest in the game.

This location will be visited during the Heavenslayer quest, and is basically a giant maze for players to figure out how to navigate. During the quest, players will meet Kiera, who is one of the more popular companions in the mod. Considering this is where Kiera is, most players will want to head here for her if nothing else. However, upon entering the Bank of England, players will come across a door that is locked and says it requires the \"Bank of England Key\" to unlock. While the Bank of England Key is needed to unlock the door, players will need to find three more keys to completely clear the Bank of England. Since this is the case, here's a breakdown of each of these key locations.\n\nPlayers will need to find the following keys in order to truly explore the bank and get everything needed: the Bank of England Key, the Bank Manager's Key, the Pindar Key Card, and the Bank Vault Key Card.\n\nRelated\n\nAll Settlements & Their Locations in Fallout London\n\nFallout London has 6 Settlements (7 if you count a home). Here's how to find them all.\n\nThe Bank of England Key Location\n\nUpon entering the Bank of England, turn left and go until finding the staircase with a door below it. Inside the door, players will find a hallway that they can travel down. At the end of the hallway, players can turn right and will find another hallway. At the end of this hallway, players will find a room with a large amount of smoke and a dead body hanging from the ceiling. There is also a door that will lead to the stairs to the second floor of the bank, go up the stairs. Finally, the keys will be hanging at the end of the hallway at the top of the stairs.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout London: All Factions (& How To Join Them)\n\nFallout London offers players different Factions. Here's how to join them all.\n\nThe Bank Pindar Key Card Location\n\nOnce players have found the Bank of England Key, they can head through the door in front of them to reach the main entrance of the bank. From there, go straight and look for a gray room with stairs in it, which players can take to the third floor. On the third floor, players will find an office at the end of the hallway that has two chairs and a desk in it. The Bank Pindar Key Card is on the desk by the broken computer.\n\nRelated\n\nAll Beer Coaster Locations in Fallout London\n\nFallout London has 30 Beer Coasters that replace Bobbleheads.

Take the stairs all the way down until entering into the bunker below the vault. Once down there, players will find a bedroom with a table in it, which is where the Bank Vault Key Card is located.\n\nRelated\n\nHow to Play Fallout London With an Existing Character\n\nWhile Fallout London wasn't made for players to use their Fallout 4 characters, they are able to do so and here's how.\n\nBank Manager Key Location\n\nWith the other three keys in hand, players can now go through the locked double doors and can unlock the door that is chained within the room. Behind this door is the garden of the bank, and the bank's manager can be found within one of the Preservation Pods. His key will be located on the ground beside him, allowing players to access the rest of the bank (and even free Kiera).\n\nFallout 4\n\nSystems\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_rice@gamerant.com", "name": "Erin Rice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pindar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vault (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bunker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/08/bank-of-england-key-location-fallout-london.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 4604, "textEnd": 4621}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The arc in question is a Fallout New Vegas-style Wild Card option, and it's set to be deployed properly in a future update.\n\nYep, stop thinking about crashes for a minute, there's a British equivalent of Yes Man's Strip-conquering adventure with The Courier just chilling behind the scenes, after Team FOLON was forced to abandon including it in the initial release.\n\nSpeaking to VG247 for an interview which you'll be able to read more of here over the next little bit and also featured chat about the modders' current plans to rectify its pesky release bugs, Fallout: London project manager Dean 'Prilladog' Carter revealed some details about this questline, and why the team wasn't able to include it in the initial release.\n\n\"That was going to be in on launch, but if you can remember back to when we did our first announcement where we said we were not going to be releasing at the end of 2023, the guy that was in charge of doing the Wild Card quest line, which is what you're referring to, he wasn't able to do it [any longer] because he was basically forcibly conscripted due to the [Russo-Ukrainian] war,\" the modder explained, \"So, as you can imagine, working on a Fallout mod was not his top priority.\n\n\"All the lines have been recorded, all the systems [have been made]. That's why people might have noticed when they're walking around, there are certain buildings or levels of the building you can't get into. It's because it was designed to be there for release, but something like that is completely out of anyone's control, I don't care if you're a big company or not. That was so out of left field and you're just like 'oh'.\n\n\"So, that will be coming in a future patch, and then you'll be probably walking around like, 'Ah, that's why that door was locked and there's a whole building behind it.' We had to basically seal everything off very quickly, but that will be coming in a future patch.\"\n\nRegarding the war, which has also caused issues for other games such as Stalker 2, Carter added: \"Quite a lot of our scripting team were around those areas, and yeah, it impacted. So that's why I had to find myself learning scripting very quickly, it's why our head writer is also now the head writer/head scripter. We had to reshuffle and a lot of us had to learn very, very quickly.\n\n\"That's why, like, I'm not even gonna lie when I say that some of the quests, maybe the implementation side behind the backend is not as good as it could be. We couldn't help what happened in that situation. You know, it was going on as it could, we had everything all planned and sorted and all the quests that he had done were all bulletproof and then suddenly boom, [that person] has to go, like that was not an option, they then had to leave.\"\n\nAre you looking forward to seeing what this Wild Card quest for Fallout: London looks like when it arrives at some point down the line?

Your enthusiasm and feedback mean the world to us,\" says the team in a Discord announcement post. \"We have some big plans for the future, starting with a hotfix.\"\n\nThe hotfix will focus on crashes and \"essential systems like Buffout 4,\" alongside other fixes that need urgent attention. Next, the development team has plans to drop a \"HUGE patch that will address all the issues reported in our Discord \u2060as well as a multitude of quest-related and other problems.\"\n\nThe mod developers plan to release the hotfix first to fans, followed by the much larger update. Unfortunately, no firm launch windows were given for either of the upcoming drops.\n\nSurprisingly, the development team is even offering \"1-on-1 troubleshooting sessions\" with players who are having problems with installation issues or crashes. Moreover, the team will be hosting a special livestream on the official Team FOLON Twitch channel at 8 pm UK time on Thursday, August 8. Fans will be able to interact with the development team and get behind-the-scenes scoops during the stream.\n\nFallout: London is currently available to install via GOG for both GOG and Steam customers who need a DRM-free version. However, installing Fallout: London on a Steam copy does require jumping through some additional hoops. Check out the installation instructions for the mod's launch over here. The Epic Games Store version of Fallout 4 is still not compatible with the mod.\n\nVia Eurogamer", "source": {"uri": "neowin.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Neowin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pulasthi_ariyasinghe@neowin.net", "name": "Pulasthi Ariyasinghe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_Store", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurogamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital rights management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/12/1703610269_fallout-london_story.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 1389, "textEnd": 1397}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

It also includes a New Vegas-style faction disguise system, allowing you to don some threads you've found and play the part of the clever infiltrator.\n\n\"Something I was working on a few years back for Fallout 4 was a Faction Reputation and Disguise system - unfortunately for me I had already played the game on my PS4, PS5, and PC, and having replayed it so many times I lost the motivation to work on the mod,\" explained, \"However, Fallout: London released and is a smaller scale game than Fallout 4, so I figured I should revive the mod so I could bring the system to London.\"\n\nCurrently, the mod's still looks to be work-in-progress, with individual towns/settlements yet to be added into the reputation system, and Invatorzen having set things up so they can take suggestions as to which disguises and quest reputation rewards they should add to it as they keep working on it.\n\nThe modder also adds that their work \"will not reward you with faction reputation or fame from previously completed quests or killed NPCs\", so you'll likely need to start a fresh save to use it properly.\n\nIf you're just interested in being able to don faction diguises on its owen, another mod, DanElwood's 'Faction Disguise System', might be worth a look.\n\nRegardless of whether you're a big enough New Vegas head to want to try out these mods, make sure to check out our array of helpful guides to things like the mod's companions and quests.", "source": {"uri": "vg247.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VG247"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reputation system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/fallout-london-mod-new-vegas-faction-rep-disguise-systems-01.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Fallout New Vegas director Josh Sawyer believes that one of the RPG's world designers brilliantly demonstrated how to reward the player in this opening section of the game.\n\n\"Eric Fenstermaker was the designer of that area, and he ensured that every skill you could take would be rewarded within the ghost town gunfight and in the area,\" Sawyer says in the video below, around the 90-second mark. \"That was our way of telling the player 'Hey if you tagged this skill and you just started playing the game, we're here and we're paying attention to the character you made, and we're going to give you rewards for that.'\"\n\nFallout New Vegas' opening is generally highly regarded among the game's extensive community. In contrast to other games in the series like Fallout 3 or 4, you don't begin by emerging from an underground vault but instead begin as a courier, shot in the head and left for dead by Benny, the RPG's secondary antagonist (and portrayed by the late Matthew Perry).\n\nLater on in the video, shortly after the five-minute mark, Sawyer speaks a little more about 'skill checks' in Fallout New Vegas. \"The number of checks across all of your skills probably should be frontloaded. In the first couple of hours you really want to make the promise like 'hey, we are rewarding you for the things you invested in,'\" Sawyer says, again speaking to the Goodsprings section of New Vegas.\n\n\"As the game goes on, that density can drop off across the board, but as long as you keep rewarding the player for their choices over time enough, then they will feel like they're being rewarded, enough to make it worthwhile,\" the veteran RPG and Obsidian developer concludes.\n\nEarlier this month in June, Sawyer said players who didn't get along with Fallout New Vegas' very divisive card game should simply \"try again.\" Good luck saying that to anyone who really hated Caravan back in the day.", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hirun_cryer@gamesradar.com", "name": "Hirun Cryer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Sawyer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Sawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout: New Vegas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodsprings,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodsprings, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goodsprings, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obsidian Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Courier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rt3yNC3qteraYXTxqWcGtE-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Companions are a perfect way to do just that: helping out in combat and sometimes offering their opinions during quests. However, one of the best aspects of Fallout 4's companions is their perks, which are special bonuses that are unique to them.\n\nFallout 4 offers 16 companions who can travel with and aid the Sole Survivor during their mission to find Shaun. Getting companions in Fallout 4 is simple, but the method can vary between the different individuals on offer. Some will require completing a specific quest or joining their faction first, while others can quickly be hired for the right amount of caps. With each offering different skills and distinct outlooks on the world, it is well worth picking up as many companions as possible during any playthrough.\n\nRelated\n\n11 Must-Have Perks in Fallout 4\n\nThere are a total of 70 Perks in Fallout 4 and deciding which to pick can make all the difference for survival. 11 of these are crucial to take.\n\nHow To Unlock Fallout 4 Companion Perks\n\nLearning What Each Character Responds To Is Key\n\nClose\n\nTo get the individual companion perks in Fallout 4, the Sole Survivor will need to increase their affinity with each companion. The affinity system is designed so that the companions respond to the Sole Survivor based on their own personal likes and dislikes. The idea is that each companion will feel more realistic as they respond to actions or dialogue in keeping with their backgrounds and beliefs.\n\nAll companions will start at zero affinity with the Sole Survivor, which is neutral, and from there, their opinion can go either up or down. At key affinity values, dialogues will trigger, and in the case of positive affinity, this will further the relationship. Positive affinity can also lead to companion quests in some cases, which will be required to reach the next level of affinity for that particular companion.\n\nAffinity\n\nRelationship\n\nReaction\n\n1000+\n\nIdolize\n\nPerk unlocked.\n\n1000\n\nInfatuation\n\nNew dialogue triggered.\n\n750\n\nConfidant\n\nNew dialogue triggered.\n\n500\n\nAdmiration\n\nNew dialogue triggered.\n\n250\n\nFriend\n\nNew dialogue triggered.\n\n0\n\nNeutral\n\n-500\n\nDisdain\n\nNew dialogue triggered.\n\n-1000\n\nHatred\n\nCompanion will refuse to travel with Sole Survivor.\n\nWhen traveling with companions, a notice frequently appears to let the Sole Survivor know how a companion feels about something they have just said or done. There are only four reactions, but each will impact affinity either positively or negatively. \"X loved that\" will result in +35, while hate is -35, and likewise, \"X liked that\" is +15, while disliked is -15.\n\nIt is important to learn what each companion responds to and plan which quests to take them on or which actions to perform. For example, Paladin Danse will not like it if the Sole Survivor is pro-Synth or if they use Chems. However, Deacon would respond very positively to pro-Synth actions, and Hancock approves of Chem use. Most companions will hate it if they witness the Sole Survivor murder someone; however, Strong and Gage will have very positive reactions to the act.\n\nDogmeat and Ada do not have affinity scores and will stay with the Sole Survivor regardless of any actions taken.

For example, Deacon's perk is great for a stealth build, while Piper's is best gained early to maximize XP gain.

One of these places is Fort Hagen, which holds more secrets than it might seem at first glance. Therefore, this guide will tell you about the Fort Hagen location in Fallout 4.\n\nWhile players can reach Fort Hagen simply by exploring the Commonwealth, we do not recommend that you do so. With some active quests, you can get a lot more benefits from this place.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4: The 24 Most Powerful Enemies, Ranked\n\nMany creatures in Fallout 4 are terrible, but there are a select few that players need to be aware of. We rank the game's most powerful enemies.\n\nFallout 4 Fort Hagen Location\n\nFort Hagen is located at the western border of the Commonwealth in Fallout 4. For convenience, you can reach it by going southwest from Jalbert Brothers Disposal. But as we said earlier, this place is worth visiting at a certain time, namely after you start the Reunions quest. This way, players will gain access to the underground part of the location, which contains most of the loot.\n\nWhat to Expect From Fort Hagen in Fallout 4\n\nFirst of all, Fort Hagen in Fallout 4 has turrets that stand on the roof of the building. Therefore, even getting close to it isn't easy. In addition, there will be a lot of Synths waiting for you inside, so you should prepare well before you explore this location.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that there are only two ways to get inside the building. The first method is the easiest, as you need to go to the garage on the side of the building. There, you will find a door that leads to the first floor of Fort Hagen in Fallout 4. For the second method, the Sole Survivor must climb the scaffolding on the northwest side.\n\nIf you come there with active Reunions, you can use the elevator. It will take you down to the basement, which will lead you to the Fort Hagen Command Center. But Synths will be waiting for you there, as well as Conrad Kellogg.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4: Best Items To Get In Nuka World\n\nFallout 4 players can find a lot of goodies throughout the Nuka World DLC. These examples are some of the best.\n\nFort Hagen Loot in Fallout 4\n\nOf course, in addition to enemies, you will find quite a lot of loot in Fort Hagen in Fallout 4. And you should not miss the Fort Hagen Command Center under it, as you can pick up a lot of stuff in it:\n\nFive Armed Bottlecap Mines - These can be found inside and outside the building. Guns and Bullets Issue #2 - In the kitchen on the second floor of Fort Hagen. FLL3 Turbopump Bearings - This can be found near the elevator leading to the basement, provided you have the Last Voyage of the U.S.S. Constitution quest active. U.S. Covert Operations Manual Issue #6 - Near the bed, in the room near the armory. Mini Nuke and Fat Man - Inside the Armory. Fort Hagen Armory Password - This can be found in the toolbox near the secret room near the cafeteria. Nuka-Cola Quantum - Found next to Fort Hagen Armory Password. Energy Weapons Bobblehead - On the table in the kitchen in the Command Center. Fusion Core - This can be found in the generator room. RobCo Fun with the Pipfall Mini-Game Holotape - Near Kellogg's terminal. Kellogg's Outfit and Pistol - Worn by Kellogg. Cybernetic Pain Inhibitor, Cybernetic Brain Augmenter, and Cybernetic Limb Actuator - Carried by Kellogg. Kellogg's Terminal Password - Carried by Kellogg.\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "artur_novichenko@gamerant.com", "name": "Artur Novichenko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Synthesizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4:_Nuka-World", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4: Nuka-World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_Survivor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sole Survivor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg's", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kellogg's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobblehead", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobblehead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fat Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cybernetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cybernetics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fallout-4-fort-hagen-location.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795165", "eventUri": "eng-9795165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 3699, "textEnd": 3716}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Sign me up!", "body": "Considered to be the greatest Fallout game ever made, Fallout: New Vegas is simply screaming out for a follow-up from Obsidian Entertainment. Sadly, nearly 14 years later and we still haven't had a new Fallout from the Avowed studio. Oh well, at least we still have plenty of mods to keep us amused.\n\nAnd amused I am, thanks to this one from Nexus Mods user SadWeeble in which NPCs in New Vegas literally explode randomly. The game itself is already known for its dark humor and elements of the slightly absurd, so this should basically fit right into your normal playthrough.\n\nSadWeeble describes it as turning the wasteland into the \"tensest game of Hot Potato.\" Imagine just strolling through the Vegas Strip or the Mojave Desert itself, only to see the denizens and Wastelanders flip and ragdoll via an explosion that leaves very little time to say goodbye to personal limbs.\n\nIt gets better, as well. The mod creator has also added in some custom settings to allow you to configure the randomness of NPCs exploding. You can, for example, change the delay before said NPC goes all boom. You can change the explosion \"type,\" reward yourself some XP each time someone explodes, and mark essential characters as ones to ignore.\n\nThe only downside perhaps is you do need a few more downloads for this one to work. SadWeeble says in order to get \"NPCs Randomly Explode\" to work, you'll need the following:\n\nI recently replayed Fallout: New Vegas, having not picked it up for a few years. One thing people typically praise the game for is its story and writing. It has a certain levity to it that offsets the somewhat bleak aspects of living in a post-apocalyptic world, something that Bethesda can't quite measure up to.

Fortunately, developer Team FOLON has announced a major patch that should fix many issues -- but it won't arrive until hotfixes have been rolled out.\n\nOn Aug. 6, on Team FOLON's Discord, the development team addressed the community and the numerous issues that have been reported since Fallout: London's release on July 25. The developer promised a bunch of hotfixes and a massive patch, though, no release date for either was revealed.\n\n\"We have some big plans for the future, starting with a hotfix. This hotfix will address some crashes and include essential systems like 'Buffout 4,' which will be merged into the mod itself. We've also identified several other fixes that will provide immediate help. Additionally, we'll be explaining certain features we added that might not have been as useful as we thought, so stay tuned for those details,\" the developer wrote on Discord.\n\nIt sounds like this hotfix will address numerous high-priority issues, which could include problems like the game failing to launch. After that, \"a HUGE patch that will address all the issues reported in our Discord\" will be rolled out. Those who are a part of this channel and have played Fallout: London themselves should know how swarmed with glitches it is.\n\nIt's great to hear the team plans to roll out hotfixes and a bug-fixing patch for Fallout: London, but we still don't know when these will happen.

The Last of Us is a great series, and I am eagerly awaiting season 2's release, however I think that the best video game adaptation TV series is Fallout.

So, it's held together better than we thought, but lots of the issues that we've had or people have been reporting rather, they're not ones that we had.\n\n\"Like, the issue with the train crash crash, which is quite a known one, and it's been reported on quite a lot. We never had that. We wouldn't have released if we had had that. None of our testers had that. So we're not sure if something actually happened with the final upload or something, but it's those sort of ones that have been a bit of a surprise to us.\n\n\"The biggest gripe that we've had is when people have installed things wrong and then they have stated that it's our fault. We know it's not the easiest install on Steam. We do understand that, we have tried our best. But yeah, when it comes to those sort of things we have got a tech support team that's been helping.\"\n\nSo, what will the update the team announced via Twitter last week do to help? \"We've been basically working as if we never released is the honest truth of that,\" Carter told me regarding it.\n\n\"I believe the order we're going to do it in will be a hotfix that should basically include things like [the] Buffout 4 [mod],\" he continued, \"So, the sort of systems that people have said are almost a requirement to run, we went and got permission for those. We didn't have permission before, which is why we never really mentioned them and they were things that people had to go and get. Since we've released, obviously, they're more inclined to want to work with us now, so now we're gonna do a hotfix that should include things like Buffout 4, which will help stability and those issues.\"\n\n\"In terms of things like what we call 'the floaty patrol', where we might have left assets just slightly off the ground, in the air, and stuff like that, we've been fixing loads and loads of those,\" he added, \"The change log is becoming a novella of the things we've fixed already. We have been [going] flat-out fixing those, because we want people to have the best experience.\"\n\nWill you be giving Fallout: London another go once these fixes arrive, or have you been managing to work your way through a playthrough just fine?

So, how did their cameos come about?\n\nSpeaking to VG247 for an interview which also featured chat about how the mod's release has gone and the cut quest line that'll be arriving in a future update, Fallout: London project manager Dean 'Prilladog' Carter revealed exactly that.\n\n\"So, the advantage of us having to do the delay due to the next gen update was that although we were fixing the systems, we were just play testing and play testing and it literally just stemmed from a stupid conversation between myself and Callum, who was the head writer/head scripter,\" the modder recalled, \"We were just sitting there, and we actually had already had a voice actor doing the role, who was just a member of the team, and we were like 'oh, wouldn't it be cool if we had John Bercow'? They were like, 'well, let's just reach out', we did, and he was up for it.\"\n\n\"He was like 'this is a very curious case',\" Carter added. \"He wanted to know if it was a commercial endeavour and we're like, 'No, we're just volunteers.' We had to explain what a mod was and what Fallout is and he was like, 'Yeah, sounds fun', and he just sent over some voice lines.\"\n\nMeanwhile, when it came to Newbon, Team FOLON found itself in the opposite position in terms of making contact. \"I'm sure my team are going to shoot me for saying this, but I had no idea who he was,\" Carter told me. \"He actually reached out to us via Twitter, I believe, and said 'I'd love to be involved, blah, blah, blah', but we get loads of those messages and I just glazed over it.\n\n\"[Then,] I happened to be streaming at one point and my team were like, 'Uh, why's Neil Newbon in your inbox?' I'm just like, 'Oh, I get loads.' They're like, 'No, no, but it's Neil Newbon.' And I'm like, 'All right, I'll reply I guess' and my team are just screaming at me, they were like 'Please reply to this man, get him on board.'\n\n\"We gave him basically like a bit role, like a very small thing. He pushed for more, he enjoyed the character of playing Barry the Boat. The whole Barry the Boat quest was basically Neil Newbon's idea, because he wanted more to do with the project. So, we ended up having to write this whole quest because he wanted more stuff to do,\" the modder revealed, adding: \"We had great fun working with him.\"\n\nHave you run into Bercow or Newbon while exploring Fallout: London yet?

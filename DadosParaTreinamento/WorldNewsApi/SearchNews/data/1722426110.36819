That didn't stop him from stamping his class in the men's 400m heats on day one of the National Association of Athletics Administrations Senior and Junior Championships at Hasely Crawford Stadium, Mucurapo on June 28. Richards of Abilene Wildcats won heat five in 47.32 seconds ahead of Cyril Sumner of Memphis Pioneers, who pushed Richards to the line in 47.37. The first-place finisher in each of the six heats qualified automatically for the finals, plus the next two fastest times. \"It was an easy run. Just went to feel out the track. It has been a while since I have been home to compete, much less in the 400m,\" Richards said. The 2024 Paris Olympics is less than one month away. Richards, who will compete in his second Olympic Games this year, is uncertain what event to run. \"Preparation has been going great I would say. I am where I want to be at this point in time in the year. I definitely would be running one of the events; I am just not sure which one yet.\" Former national junior athlete Shakeem McKay, who is now based at Louisiana State University, had the best time in the heats with 46.20 in heat four. The other athletes who won their respective heats were Elijah Joseph (47.69); Jaden Marchan (47.00); Joshua St Clair (47.40); and Che Lara (48.08). The finals will be held on Saturday at 7.05 pm. In the boys Under-20 400m heats, Jaden Clement of MAP won in 47.46 to seal a spot in the final. Devonni Ferguson of 473 MVP Inc (47.68) and Joshua Perry of Memphis Pioneers (47.97) will also be aiming for a podium finish in the final. There were a few field-event finals on Friday. In the girls Under-17 triple jump, US-born Seannah Parsons won with a leap of 11.88 metres and TT junior athlete Tenique Vincent of Concorde was second with a 11.09m effort. Keneisha Shelbourne, the lone athlete in the girls Under-20 triple jump, competed alongside Parsons and Vincent. Shelbourne of Oasics Athletic recorded a best jump of 12.48m. Parsons, who may compete for TT one day because of her Tobago roots, was satisfied with her performance. \"I am happy that it was all consistent,\" she said. \"This is my second time (competing in Trinidad). The season in America is finished, so since I have citizenship here I just come here and compete.\" In the boys Under-17 high jump, Lemuel Ogbeifen of Kaizen Panthers copped gold (1.94m) and Tenique's twin brother Tyrique was second (1.91m). Rounding off the top three was Michal Paul of Concorde (1.73m). The girls 100m Under-17 heats were also staged early on Friday. Noemi Theodore of Phoenix was the fastest qualifier as she clocked 12.59. Day two of the championships will begin at 2 pm on June 29 and action on the third and final day will start at 2 pm on June 30.", "summary": "<p><img width=\"825\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/23239336-825x510.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<p>JEREEM Richards is still trying to decide whether to run the 200-metre or 400m event at the Paris Olympic Games.

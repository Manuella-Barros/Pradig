{"id": 243307428, "title": "Track and field trials: Grant Holloway just misses world record", "text": "EUGENE, Ore. \u2013The question was do you feel it when you\u2019re running a world record? \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d said Holloway, who has twice lowered the world indoor 60 meter high hurdles record. \u201cYou just hope and pray or you feel the momentum at the end of the race. You just hope and pray it\u2019s what you want and you look up at the clock and see what it is.\u201d So after lunging across the finish line of the Olympic trials 110-meter high hurdles final Friday night, Holloway, the four-time world champion, immediately looked up at the scoreboard on Hayward Field\u2019s south end. When he clasped his hands on the sides of his head, threw back his head and let out a deep and aggrieved scream, his body contorting in frustration it was clear he hadn\u2019t seen what he had hoped: a new world record. Or maybe Holloway was clutching his head to protect himself from the roar that accompanied him over each of the 42-inch hurdles to a world leading 12.86 second clocking. Hayward Field cranked up to 11. Or maybe the knowledge that he was perhaps a clipped eighth hurdle away from finally breaking Aries Merritt\u2019s 12-year-old world record of 12.80 was too much to bear. \u201cYeah, I was kind of mad at myself because for the first time in a long time, I hit a hurdle,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cAnd it kind of threw off my rhythm, but I knew what kind of pace I was on. So I knew it was there. \u201cSo we just have to continue to just work, continue to freshen up, sharpen our knives and get ready (for the Olymics).\u201d Behind Holloway, Freddie Crittenden was second in 12.93, Daniel Roberts third in 12.96 in the first race ever in which three runners dipped under 13. Anticipation of a Holloway world record had been building all week in Tracktown USA. Holloway opened with a then world leading 12.92 in Monday\u2019s opening round, initially thinking, mistakenly, that he had run 12.83, just two hundredths of second off the world record. \u201cI was about to throw everything in and say I\u2019m not doing it anymore,\u201d the seven-time NCAA champion for Florida said. He followed up with a 12.96 in Thursday\u2019s semifinals. \u201cAs you know, in track and field it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019ve done last year or two years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how you\u2019re doing it now. The big thing for me is I\u2019ve been having good practices. As long as it translates for me from practice to the track, I\u2019m good.\u201d \u201cThe only other thing was to put pressure on the field, let everyone know I\u2019m still on top, no diddy, and see what happens after that.\u201d World record expectations were further heightened Friday when New Balance\u2019s Gabby Thomas won her 200 semi in a world leading 21.78 and then Noah Lyles, the reigning world 100 and 200 champion, took his semi in a wind-aided 19.60 with five men dipping under 20 seconds. For Holloway it\u2019s not about what he did last year or the year before when he won the 110 highs at both the 2022 and 2023 World Championships. It\u2019s about what he didn\u2019t do in 2021. Holloway went to the Tokyo Olympics as one of the biggest favorites of the Games after he just missed breaking Merritt\u2019s world record with a 12.81 blast in the trials semis. But he was upset by Jamaica\u2019s Hansle Parchmant 13.04 to 13.09. Holloway keeps his Olympic silver medal in the same box that holds his four World golds. \u201cMotivation, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I look at it every day and say it should be mine? No. \u201cI\u2019ve done four world championships after that, indoors and outdoors combined, and I\u2019ve got four gold medals. So I already solidified myself.\u201d But the absence of an Olympic gold medal on his resume might be the only explanation as to why Holloway for all his domination of his event the past three seasons is not seen in the same galaxy as hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone or Lyles. Holloway was pursued by Georgia for football, and Florida for track while at Chesapeake, Virginia\u2019s Grassfield High. He chose track over life between the hedges, going on to win seven NCAA titles for the Gators. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this zone,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this funk. I\u2019ve been in this thing where I\u2019m just continuing to pump out the 12.9s like Aries did in 2012. And I know my progression. So we\u2019re just trying to stay consistent in that aspect.\u201d", "summary": "Gabby Thomas also runs world leading time at Olympic trials.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/28/track-and-field-trials-grant-holloway-just-misses-world-record/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24181110982489_d72c30.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:21:57", "author": "Scott M.

Legal revisions announced late on Friday aim to \"improve the ability for emergency prevention and response\" and refine how information is disseminated about natural disasters, accidents and public health emergencies.

An escalation of extreme weather events has tested China's emergency responses in recent years as the country faces more severe floods and drought. Disasters such as earthquakes have also challenged local officials in remote and rural areas.

Official guidance over news coverage will be tightened. The law calls for an enhanced \"news interviewing and reporting system\" for emergencies but does not give specific guidelines. Government departments must \"guide\" news media and \"support\" them in conducting interviews and reporting, as well as \"conduct supervision\" on public opinion.

The revisions make terms for journalists reporting on emergencies even more prescriptive, said Jemimah Steinfeld, the CEO of UK-based Index on Censorship. The revisions, passed by the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, add more than 30 provisions to the 2007 law. The law bars government agencies from instructing others to delay, falsely report or conceal information, or obstruct others from reporting. Tardy reaction from officials in managing disasters have triggered public backlashes in the past. A hospital fire that killed 29 in Beijing last year prompted online debate as official news reports only surfaced eight hours after the incident. Also last year residents in Zhuozhou complained of receiving no warnings and of authorities that \"disappeared\" as unprecedented floods inundated the northern city. Under the legal revisions, foreigners in China will be required to abide by the law and follow local government decisions and orders. \"Overall, this points to the need for foreigners living and working in China, media outlets as well as international businesses with a presence in the country, to pay close attention to the emerging regulatory system around crisis preparedness, as well as the political expectations in case of emergency,\" said Drinhausen. Foreign reporters sometimes face grassroots resistance and even obstruction while gathering news on the ground about accidents and disasters. In 2021, an angry crowd targeted a German journalist while he was reporting on floods in the central city of Zhengzhou, accusing foreign journalists of \"slandering everything in China\", German media DW reported. Journalists from Chinese state media have also been harassed. In March, reporters from the state broadcaster and other media were blocked and shoved while covering a blast at a fried chicken shop in Sanhe, a city next to Beijing, prompting the domestic association overseeing Chinese journalists to issue a rare statement of protest.

They began dating in 2014, a year after the 94-year-old filed for divorce from ex Dina Eastwood -- with whom he shares daughter Morgan Eastwood, 27, -- after 17 years of marriage.\n\nWhile Clint and Christina kept their personal lives private, the couple did make appearances at events together over the years, including the 2015 Oscars and the red carpets for Sully in 2016, his films The Mule and The 15:17 to Paris in 2018, as well as Richard Jewell in 2019.\n\nPrior to his relationships with Christina and Dina, Clint was married to ex Maggie Johnson and in long-term relationships with Roxanne Tunis, Sondra Locke, Jacelyn Reeves and Frances Fisher.\n\nAnd although Clint -- who is also father to kids Laurie Murray, 70, Kimber Lynn Eastwood, 60, Kyle Eastwood, 56, Alison Eastwood, 52, Scott Eastwood, 38, Kathryn Eastwood, 36, and Francesca Eastwood, 30 -- has been a prolific figure on Hollywood for more than six decades, he's remained quiet on the inner workings of his life.\n\n\"There are other people that are involved there and they're vulnerable people,\" Clint previously shared on CBS News. \"I can protect myself, but they can't.\"\n\nBut in the past, Dina had spoken about their family and reflected on the kind of partner the Oscar winner was.\n\n\"He's probably the sweetest guy I've ever met,\" she said on Bethenny after filing for divorce. \"He is the sweetest, he is a loving, kind, low-key person so my intuition was still great on marrying a good person.\"\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]", "source": {"uri": "brudirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BruneiDirect"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clint Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mission Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dina Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/87th_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "87th Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sondra_Locke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sondra Locke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Fisher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frances Fisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jewell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Jewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alison Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francesca Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Eastwood"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747721", "eventUri": "eng-9747721", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 321, "textEnd": 328}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Despite their long-term union, the couple were quiet about their private life and kept it away from the limelight.\n\nAfter confirming the news of her death, Eastwood released a statement, heartbreaking saying, \"Christina was a lovely, caring woman, and I will miss her very much.\"\n\nOf course, this is far from the first major relationship that Eastwood has been a part of during his life. The 94-year-old had initially been married to Maggie Johnson in 1953 before splitting a decade later and finally getting a divorce in 1983. The director had also been married to famous TV news anchor Dina Ruiz in 1996 before the pair separated in 1996.\n\nIn that span of time, Eastwood was known for having relationships with his colleagues as well. The actor enjoyed a relationship with actor Sondra Locke, working in films such as The Outlaw Josey Wales, before separating after 14 years together in 1989. Locke would eventually move away from the big screen in the 2000s, only starring in the movie Ray Meets Helen before passing away in 2018.\n\nEastwood also notably dated actor Frances Fisher. The pair worked together in the film The Unforgiven and started dating in 1990 before parting ways four years later.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Sandera was best known as a resident of Carmel-by-the-Sea, where Eastwood previously served as mayor. While she shied away from the public eye, Sandera did make a few public appearances with Eastwood for various award shows, including when he received Academy Award nominations for films such as American Sniper and the premieres of films like The Mule and The 15:17 to Paris.\n\nIn the past few years, Eastwood has also been keeping busy both in front of and behind the camera. Outside of being the director behind films like Richard Jewell, he had also returned to acting in the 2021 film Cry Macho. His latest directorial venture is Juror No. 2, which tells the story of a juror in a murder trial that he may have been involved in. The film is currently in post-production.\n\nAt this stage, no cause of death has been revealed for Sandera.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_coffman@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Tim Coffman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clint Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mission Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sondra_Locke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sondra Locke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dina Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outlaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cry_Macho_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cry Macho (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Unforgiven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Unforgiven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Fisher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frances Fisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jewell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Jewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel-by-the-Sea,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmel-by-the-Sea, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carmel-by-the-Sea, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/02/Clint-Eastwood-Actor-Director-2018-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747721", "eventUri": "eng-9747721", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

In 2014, Us confirmed that the couple met while she was a hostess working at Eastwood's Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. (The Oscar winner was formerly the mayor of the cozy beach town.)\n\nThe twosome have remained private about their relationship over the years. However, they have attended several Hollywood events together. Sandera and Eastwood made their red carpet debut at the 2015 Academy Awards. Eastwood's film American Sniper was up for six awards including Best Picture. She continued to accompany him at events including the premieres of his projects Sully, The Mule, The 15:17 to Paris and Richard Jewell.\n\nEastwood was married twice before his romance with Sandera. The actor wed model Maggie Johnson in 1953. They share two children, son Kyle and daughter Allison. The exes divorced in 1984.\n\nMore than a decade later, Clint tied the knot for a second time with Dina Eastwood in 1996. The pair welcomed daughter Morgan later that year. Dina and Clint split in 2013 after 17 years of marriage and finalized their divorce the following year. (Dina moved on with current husband Scott Fisher in 2016.)\n\nIn addition to the children he welcomed with his ex-wives, Clint is also the father of daughter Laurie, whom he met later in life, daughter Kimber whom he welcomed with ex Roxanne Tunis, son Scott and daughter Katryn whom he shares with ex Jacelyn Reeves. He shares daughter Francesca with ex Frances Fisher.\n\n\"I'm a much better father now than when I was younger because then I was working all around the world and I was desperate to find the brass ring, so I worked constantly,\" the actor said of his family dynamic in a 2008 interview with The Star. \"Now my daughter takes precedence over everything and even though I've done a lot of work in the past year, it's not because I've ignored her or not been involved in her school activities.\"\n\nClint added that as he grows older it makes him \"appreciate everything a lot more.\"\n\n\"I never started out thinking I would have a big family but now it's very important to me and family relationships take precedence over work,\" he reflected. \"I think I'm a good dad and by and large I have a great relationship with my kids, although I can't say it has always been that way.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_simpson@usmagazine.com", "name": "Kaitlin Simpson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dina Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mission Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel-by-the-Sea,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carmel-by-the-Sea, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carmel-by-the-Sea, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/87th_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "87th Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sniper_(book)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Sniper (book)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jewell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Jewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Picture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_R._Fisher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott R.

Eastwood described Sandera as a \"lovely, caring woman\" and expressed that he will miss her deeply. Further details about her passing will not be disclosed, according to The Mule actor's spokesperson.\n\nEastwood and Sandera had been together since 2014 when she was working as a hostess at his Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. The couple made their red carpet debut at the 2015 Academy Awards, and she has accompanied him to various other events over the years.\n\nBefore his relationship with Sandera, Eastwood was married to journalist Dina Ruiz from 1996 until their separation in 2014. His first marriage was to model Maggie Johnson, whom he wed in 1953. Their divorce was not finalized until 1984, despite settling in 1964.\n\nThroughout his life, Eastwood has fathered eight children. He shares daughter Morgan, 27, with Ruiz; son Kyle, 56, and daughter Alison, 52, with Johnson; daughter Laurie, 69, with an unidentified woman; and daughter Kimber, 60, with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis. He also shares son Scott, 38, and daughter Kathryn, 36, with flight attendant Jacelyn Reeves and welcomed daughter Francesca, 30, with actress Frances Fisher in 1993.\n\nEastwood recently made a memorable appearance at his daughter Morgan's wedding to Tanner Koopmans at the end of June. The ceremony took place on Saturday, June 15, at Mission Ranch in Carmel, California, a property owned and restored by the 5-time Academy Award winner himself. In an exclusive interview with People, Eastwood was photographed proudly walking his daughter down the aisle, while she wore an elegant gown, highlighting her baby bump. In other photos, The American Sniper actor was captured with his hand lovingly on his daughter's stomach, seemingly greeting his future grandchild.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jane_lacroix@newsweek.com", "name": "Jane LaCroix", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clint Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dina Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mission Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/87th_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "87th Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel-by-the-Sea,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carmel-by-the-Sea, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carmel-by-the-Sea, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sniper_(book)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Sniper (book)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Fisher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frances Fisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_performer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stunt performer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen Actors Guild Awards", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2433083/clint-eastwood-partner.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=566d1e991736bbf27fc2859f3430a9dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747721", "eventUri": "eng-9747721", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 316, "textEnd": 323}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 1669, "textEnd": 1676}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

During their union, they welcomed daughter Alison, 52, and son Kyle, 56.\n\nHis eldest child, 70-year-old daughter Laurie Murray, was the result of a 1953 fling. Without Clint's knowledge, Laurie's mother -- whose identity has never been revealed -- got pregnant and put the baby up for adoption.\n\nLaurie was adopted by a couple in Seattle and later learned Clint was her father after embarking on a quest to locate her birth parents.\n\nA family friend told DailyMail.com back in 2018: 'This all happened around 30 years ago. Laurie had been really interested in finding out who her real parents were and hired someone to help her. When they found the paperwork, her biological mother had written down Clint Eastwood's name.\n\n'From what it appeared, Clint Eastwood had no idea that she was even pregnant.'\n\nThe news was received positively by Clint and his family. He took Laurie to the Oscars in 2004 and they've bonded over golf as adults.\n\nClint's second eldest Kimber Lynn, 59 -- who works as a pro makeup artist in Hollywood -- was born in 1964 during Clint's affair with dance/actress Roxanne Tunis, who passed away last year at age 93.\n\nClint shares son Scott and daughter Kathryn, 36, with flight attendant Jacelyn Reeves, who he dated from 1985 to 1990.\n\nHis second youngest child, daughter Francesca Eastwood, was born during his relationship with Titanic star Frances Fisher, 72, in the early 1990s.\n\nAfter his split from Dina in 2012, Clint moved on with actress/model Christina Sandera, 60, in 2014. The couple are still together and live in California.\n\nClint became a grandfather for the first time -- to his initial knowledge -- in 1984 with the birth of daughter Kimber's son Clinton, 40.\n\nBut Clint's eldest grandchild is actually Laurie's 41-year-old son Lowell Thomas Murray IV, who works as a fitness trainer and is a former contestant on the 18th season of ABC's The Bachelorette.\n\nLaurie also shares a daughter named Kelsey, whose age is unknown, with husband Lowell Thomas Murray III.\n\nClint's granddaughter Graylen, 30, was born in 1994 and is his son Kyle's only child.\n\nFinally, Clint's youngest grandchild is six-year-old Titan. Titan belongs to Clint's daughter Francesca and Greystone Park actor Alexander Wraith.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [],

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nClint Eastwood's partner of 10-years Christina Sandera has died aged 61.\n\nClint paid a heartbreaking tribute to her in a statement released on Thursday night, saying: \"Christina was a lovely, caring woman, and I will miss her very much.\" A Warner Bros. spokesperson added to THR there will be no further information released, reports the Mirror.\n\nThe private couple began their relationship soon after he divorced his second wife Dina after almost 20 years of marriage. Christina and Clint kept their relationship private and reportedly first met when she was working as a hostess at his Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant in Carmel-by-the-Sea in California.\n\nDespite being a very private couple, she supported Clint at several premieres and awards shows. She made her red carpet debut with him at the Oscars in 2015, when his movie American Sniper was up for six gongs. He is a father to eight children by six different women.\n\nHis first marriage was to manufacturing secretary-turned-fitness instructor Maggie Neville Johnson in 1953. During their time together, they had an 'open relationship'. The affair resulted in his daughter Laurie being born, but the mother put her up for adoption without the actor's knowledge.\n\nIt wasn't until much later he found out she was adopted by a couple in Seattle. An insider close to him told MailOnline in 2018: \"This all happened around 30 years ago. Laurie had been really interested in finding out who her real parents were and hired someone to help her. When they found the paperwork, her biological mother had written down Clint Eastwood's name. From what it appeared, Clint Eastwood had no idea that she was even pregnant.\"\n\nIn 2004, the Every Which Way But Loose actor took her to the Oscars. Another affair resulted in a daughter, Kimber, born in 1964. Clint and his wife Maggie had two of their own children, Kyle (born in 1968) and Alison (born in 1972).\n\nThe couple parted ways, divorcing in 1984 and he went on to have several casual relationships.

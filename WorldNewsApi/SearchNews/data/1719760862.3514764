The EV startup\u2019s stock tanked more than 33% in pre-market trading Wednesday, just a day after it reported earnings for the 2023 fiscal year. Los Angeles-based Faraday reported $800,000 in revenue and a $432 million net loss while holding onto $4 million in cash. As of May 23, Faraday had about $5 million on hand, including restricted cash of about $2 million. Adding to worries about the startup, Faraday has withdrawn its production guidance for 2024, citing current market conditions and a lack of funding. In November, executives said the company planned to assemble 1,000 vehicles this year, \u201csubject to availability of requisite capital.\u201d After a five-year production delay, Faraday last August finally delivered its first FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance to customers; the $309,000 electric crossover SUV was first unveiled in 2017. Overall, the startup sold a whopping four EVs and leased six in 2023. \u201c2023 was a milestone year for FF,\u201d CEO Matthias Aydt said in a statement. \u201cWe transitioned to a phase of growth that focuses on production and revenue generation, establishing FF\u2019s position in the ultra-luxury and high-performance EV market.\u201d Faraday said Tuesday that it may be delisted from the Nasdaq over its failure to report its first-quarter earnings. The company was hit with a prior delisting notice from the Nasdaq in December because of rules requiring stocks to close at a minimum share price of $1. In February, Faraday announced plans for a reverse stock split, its second stock split in less than half a year after a series of issues decimated its value. Despite all that, Faraday stock has climbed 2,825% in May and currently trades at about 80 cents per share. The stock was worth less than five cents per share when the month began. But that was before Faraday got caught up in this month\u2019s meme stock rally. Earlier this month, \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d \u2014 the online persona of American investor Keith Patrick Gill, who is known for igniting GameStop\u2019s massive meme stock short squeeze in 2021 \u2014 posted on X after a three-year hiatus, sending GameStop stock up as much as 110% and halting trading several times. AMC and a handful of other stocks \u2014 including Faraday \u2014 also caught the tailwinds of the renewed meme stock frenzy. Faraday stock skyrocketed more than 100% on some days. At one point during the frenzy, the stock had registered an 8,359.9% gain and hit $3.90 per share, before shedding a large chunk of those gains.", "summary": "<img class=\"type:primaryImage\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_80,w_636/b43f3b4d77bcdffaa96af7d0216354dd.jpg\"/><p> The electric vehicle industry\u2019s one and only \u201cmeme stock\u201d was down in the dumps Wednesday, as Faraday Future Intelligent Electric faces a bumpy road through 2024.</p><p><a href=\"https://qz.com/faraday-futures-memestocks-evs-earnings-gamestop-1851505834\">Read more...</a></p>", "url": "https://qz.com/faraday-futures-memestocks-evs-earnings-gamestop-1851505834", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/b43f3b4d77bcdffaa96af7d0216354dd.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:13:42", "author": "William Gavin", "authors": ["William Gavin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.227}

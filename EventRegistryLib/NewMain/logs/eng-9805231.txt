However, a slow start in the semifinals resulted in a third-place finish in his group and his time was not enough to advance.\n\nDe Grasse finished 0.1 seconds off the minimum qualifying time.\n\nTwo other Canadians, Brendon Rodney and Aaron Brown, competed in the 200m dash semifinals. Neither managed to qualify for the final and both ran slower than De Grasse.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic star De Grasse was also eliminated in the men's 100m final earlier in these Olympics after running a 9.98 in the semifinals. It was the first time he failed to qualify for the 100m final at any Olympic Games he's participated in.\n\nIt's been an eventful Games for De Grasse as his personal coach, Rana Reider, was sent home from Paris amid allegations of abuse.\n\nThe Paris Games aren't over for De Grasse, who is a key member of Canada's 4 x 100m relay team. He explained today that he hopes the running start of the relay will help reduce the load on his ailing hamstring, as well as that the straight track of the 100m will be easier than the bends involved in the 200m.\n\nThe 4 x 100m Olympic event starts tomorrow at 5:44 am ET/2:44 am PT. De Grasse will be looking to help the team reach the final, which will run at 1:47 pm ET/10:47 am PT.\n\nCanada won a silver medal in the relay event at the Tokyo 2020 Games and a bronze at the Rio 2016 Games.

Teammates Aaron Brown, Jerome Blake and Brendon Rodney also had little to show for their Olympic experience until Friday's relay final.\n\nThe Canadians just barely qualified for the final eight and were running in the less-than-desirable outside lane. But the Canadian men eliminated one race favourite in the Jamaicans in the semi-final and the Americans botched a handoff in the final, leaving the field wide open and ripe for an upset.\n\nAnd De Grasse and company took full advantage. After a bit of a messy first exchange between Brown and Blake, the next two exchanges were clean and De Grasse was fire on the anchor leg to win gold, finishing 7/100ths of a second ahead of South Africa. Great Britain in 37.61 took third.\n\nDe Grasse, the pride of Markham who trains at The Speed Academy in Pickering, is now tied with swimmer Penny Oleksiak as Canada's all-time most decorated Olympian.\n\nThis quartet is on the Olympic podium for the second straight Games after winning silver at Tokyo three years ago. De Grasse, Rodney and Brown previously earned bronze at Rio 2016 as well.\n\nBrown, Blake, Rodney, and De Grasse also won gold at the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon.\n\nWhether De Grasse sticks around for Los Angeles in 2028 - when he would be 33 - is a question for another day. Today, he and Rodney, Blake and Brown are Olympic champions.\n\nThis is Canada's fifth Olympic medal all-time in the men's 4x100m relay. They won gold in Atlanta in 1996 with a squad that included 100-metre gold medallist Donovan Bailey, Bruny Surin (Team Canada's Paris 2024 Chef de Mission), Glenroy Gilbert (the current national team

But the Jamaican edged him by two-hundredths of a second, and he ran the same 19.78 to win gold the next day. De Grasse earned a silver at 20.02 seconds.\n\nDe Grasse never did take Bolt's mantle, as it seemed he might for a split-second there in Brazil. Instead, the Markham, Ont., native simply succeeded Bolt as the 200-metre champion in Tokyo, one of six Olympic medals to his name.\n\nThe story of Andre De Grasse is one of confidence, consistency and clutchness.\n\nHis six medals in six straight events over two Olympics still leave Akeem Haynes, who won bronze with De Grasse in the Rio relay, in awe.\n\n\"It's so much pressure. And one of the things that people from the outside looking in don't equate and don't add into the mix is there's a nervousness that comes. You may not feel it in the heat, you may not feel it in the semis, but in the finals and everybody's watching for a split second, they're going to feel it,\" Haynes said.\n\n\"And Andre has this ability to stay calm in the midst of chaos, to stay calm in the midst of pressure. And that calming feeling is what has helped him throughout his career.\"\n\nNow 29, things haven't gone quite so smoothly for De Grasse in Paris. He missed both the 100 and 200 finals, saying he was hampered by a hamstring injury.\n\nOn Friday, he'll anchor the men's 4x100 relay team in the final at the Stade de France. Given the increase in injuries De Grasse has dealt with since Tokyo, and as the rest of the world has gotten faster -- De Grasse also missed out on the podium at the most recent world championships -- it may be his last, best chance at tying swimmer Penny Oleksiak as Canada's most decorated Olympian with seven medals.\n\n\"In my opinion, when everybody says, oh, you know, Andre has this many medals and this and that, I personally think he's overachieved. This is all icing on the cake,\" Haynes said.\n\nWATCH | Relay team eyes podium in Paris:\n\nIn his early teenage years, De Grasse harboured hopes of a professional basketball career -- perhaps an early sign that he would not allow any limitations, height or otherwise, to get in his way.\n\nIt is no wonder, then, that he showed up to his first high school track meet in basketball shorts, nor did he bother with starting blocks. Even still, he ran a 10.91 in the 100.\n\nDe Grasse broke out internationally at the 2015 Pan Am Games in Toronto, where he completed the 100-200 double.\n\nHis first encounter with Bolt came later that year at the world championships, where the marquee race was again the semifinal, and where the towering Jamaican beat De Grasse by a hair despite stumbling out of the blocks.\n\nIn Rio, De Grasse won bronze in the 100 and 4x100 to go with his 200 silver.\n\nThe Rio races raised hopes that De Grasse could follow in Donovan Bailey's footsteps as the fastest man in the world.\n\nBailey watched the Rio 100 from the CBC Olympics studio in Brazil, where cameras caught him jumping up and down during the race, stride for stride with De Grasse, and shadow-boxing in celebration when his fellow Canadian crossed the line in third place.\n\nHe said he still gets nervous watching Canadian sprinters.\n\n\"There's a standard that I set which was being the greatest sprinter on earth, the greatest sprinter in history and happened to wear the Canadian uniform. And what Andre has done in his career is definitely take advantage of the opportunities every single time he was at the world stage,\" Bailey said.\n\nIn the wake of Rio, Bolt himself stoked the fire surrounding the De Grasse hype.\n\n\"He came through again. He's going to be good; he runs just like me. I mean, he's really slow at the blocks, but when he gets going, he gets going,\" Bolt said after his final Olympics.\n\nBolt's prophecy proved true, though De Grasse's flawed starts were far from fatal, as the next Olympic cycle proved.\n\nThe Canadian returned to five years later for the Tokyo Games and collected his first gold medal in a 200m race against American Noah Lyles, who did not lose again in the discipline until a stunning loss on Thursday to Botswana's Letsil Tebogo.\n\nDe Grasse also picked up another 100 bronze, as well as a relay silver in Japan.\n\nOne year later, De Grasse anchored the relay team to an upset win over Lyles and the U.S. at the world championships in Eugene, Ore.\n\n\"I never count him out no matter what's happening,\" said Robert Esmie, a member of the Canadian Olympic champion 4x100 relay team alongside Bailey in 1996. \"He's a show guy. He shows up at the right time, at the right place. His mental attribute is way superior than a lot of the peers out there.\"\n\nWATCH | De Grasse reacts to being named flag-bearer for opening ceremony:\n\nThe sense of calmness helps power De Grasse in those relay anchor legs, which can often devolve into chaos.\n\nHaynes said there's one other reason he succeeds in that spot, too.\n\n\"Andre has always been able to deliver on that anchor leg because he doesn't have to push out the blocks. He's already upright running,\" he noted.\n\n\"And there is also this added thing in the relays, it's like you're not running just for yourself. You're running for your group of your boys, your friends, your people.\n\n\"And so I just think when Andre is on that anchor, like man, he's able to just run free and he's able to just go and just catch guys. And if we got the lead, he's going to hold it off.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen what the future holds for De Grasse -- it was somewhat startling to hear the broadcast note that he was the oldest man in his 200 heat in Paris, when those Rio memories somehow still seem so fresh.\n\nBailey called De Grasse's career to date \"impressive,\" but challenged him for more.\n\n\"I'd like to see him rank number one in the world before he retires. I would like to see him get a couple of world records,\" Bailey said.\n\nConversely, Haynes said De Grasse should be satisfied no matter if he competes at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles or not.\n\n\"Athletes always have a high level of pressure on themselves and you always want to perform extremely well. And so many times we get fixated on the medals. ... But I would just hope that he is just enjoying the moment. I think it's important for him to remember that like, man, he's overachieved.\"\n\nYet Bailey and Haynes agreed that if he chooses, De Grasse could have more to give.\n\n\"I think he's going to get better in the next two years, in my opinion, if he can stay locked in and stay motivated,\" Haynes said.\n\nFor now, a record-tying podium appearance lies in the balance on Friday in Paris.\n\nBut regardless of the outcome, De Grasse has imprinted himself in Canadian Olympic lore in a blur of gold, silver and bronze.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"},

He now sits just one behind the GOAT, Usain Bolt, in that category.\n\nDespite the individual setbacks in these Paris Games -- none of the runners on Canada's four-man team qualified for the finals in the 100-metre or 200-metre -- this Canadian squad has proven to be an absolute machine when it matters most in team relay events. The quartet combined to win the world championship in 2022, while De Grasse, Rodney and Brown were all part of Canada's silver medal-winning effort in Tokyo in the 4x100-metre.\n\n\"It feels pretty amazing. To be out with these guys, my brothers, I've been with them since the beginning of time, so it's amazing,\" said De Grasse following the race.\n\n\"We talked about this moment for years. It feels good to bring it to fruition. I'm super grateful.\"\n\nThe man of the moment himself also took to X (formerly Twitter) immediately following his thoroughbred-like performance:\n\nIt wasn't just one man getting in done, however, as the entire team instantly became Canadian legends with the win after running a blistering 37.50s in the rain -- a season's best time for the squad despite the poor conditions inside Stade de France.\n\nThe electric performance from Brown, Rodney, Blake and De Grasse secured the second-ever gold medal in the men's 4x100-metre relay for Canada. The 1996 team in Atlanta, featuring Donovan Bailey, Robert Esmie, Glenroy Gilbert and Bruny Surin, was the last and only other Canadian squad to conquer the event.\n\nThough absolutely legendary in its own right, that Atlanta gold-medal win wasn't nearly as shocking as the one Canadians witnessed on Friday.\n\nAnd fans from coast to coast were quick to let the entire squad know exactly how incredible that result really was.\n\nContrary to the result that Canadians are celebrating with all of their hearts, the favoured Americans had an absolutely disastrous race, finishing seventh before being disqualified after a botched handoff.\n\nPolarizing U.S. star Noah Lyles, who won the gold in the men's 100-metre and bronze in the 200-metre earlier these Games, didn't race for Team USA in the relay after he contracted COVID earlier in the week.

Spoiler: Canadians are pretty fired up\n\nIf you're a Canadian and your heart was almost pumping out of your chest after that race, you may want to get your vitals checked.\n\nOn a damp, rainy day in Paris, the Canadian quartet of Aaron Brown, Brendon Rodney, Jerome Blake and anchor Andre De Grasse shocked the world by capturing gold in the men's 4x100 relay -- a race they entered as massive long-shots to win at 50-1 odds.\n\nAdding more theatre to Canada's incredible triumph was the fact De Grasse, running last, was stuck in the middle of the pack before finding another gear over the last 20-30 metres and blistering past the field to cross the line first in thrilling fashion.\n\nThe gold marks the seventh Olympic medal of De Grasse's career and the second gold after he won silver in the men's 200-metre in Tokyo three years ago -- tying him with Penny Oleksiak as Canada's most decorated Olympian ever.\n\nDe Grasse -- who has reportedly been dealing with a lingering leg injury for months -- didn't even qualify for the finals in the men's 100-metre or his specialty, the 200-metre, for the first time in his Olympic career, leading to speculation that the Scarborough, Ontario, native could possibly forego the 4x100-metre relay event.\n\nNot only did De Grasse run, he arguably ran the race of his life -- and Canadians were quick to flock to social media to praise their gutsy sprinting hero.\n\nDe Grasse also passed American legend Carl Lewis for second in career sprint and relay medals in the Olympics. He now sits just one behind the GOAT, Usain Bolt, in that category.\n\nDespite the individual setbacks in these Paris Games -- none of the runners on Canada's four-man team qualified for the finals in the 100-metre or 200-metre -- this Canadian squad has proven to be an absolute machine when it matters most in team relay events. The quartet combined to win the world championship in 2022, while De Grasse, Rodney and Brown were all part of Canada's silver medal-winning effort in Tokyo in the 4x100-metre.\n\n\"It feels pretty amazing. To be out with these guys, my brothers, I've been with them since the beginning of time, so it's amazing,\" said De Grasse following the race.\n\n\"We talked about this moment for years. It feels good to bring it to fruition. I'm super grateful.\"\n\nThe man of the moment himself also took to X (formerly Twitter) immediately following his thoroughbred-like performance:\n\nIt wasn't just one man getting in done, however, as the entire team instantly became Canadian legends with the win after running a blistering 37.50s in the rain -- a season's best time for the squad despite the poor conditions inside Stade de France.\n\nThe electric performance from Brown, Rodney, Blake and De Grasse secured the second-ever gold medal in the men's 4x100-metre relay for Canada. The 1996 team in Atlanta, featuring Donovan Bailey, Robert Esmie, Glenroy Gilbert and Bruny Surin, was the last and only other Canadian squad to conquer the event.\n\nThough absolutely legendary in its own right, that Atlanta gold-medal win wasn't nearly as shocking as the one Canadians witnessed on Friday.\n\nAnd fans from coast to coast were quick to let the entire squad know exactly how incredible that result really was.\n\nContrary to the result that Canadians are celebrating with all of their hearts, the favoured Americans had an absolutely disastrous race, finishing seventh before being disqualified after a botched handoff.\n\nPolarizing U.S. star Noah Lyles, who won the gold in the men's 100-metre and bronze in the 200-metre earlier these Games, didn't race for Team USA in the relay after he contracted COVID earlier in the week. Despite his absence, Canadian fans, media outlets and Olympians dragged Lyles online as some of his old comments started surfacing on social media immediately following Friday's final.\n\nThis is the good stuff, Canada.\n\nThe relay team's gold medal means Canada has tied their record for most golds at a non-boycotted Olympic Games with seven, as well as their most medals -- 24 (including their guaranteed medal from Friday's women's beach volleyball final).", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Frame_Relay", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Frame Relay", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OHV0NM3PTRMoykulBNj_UQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-08/039dc230-568e-11ef-b7d7-a954e06fd23a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805231", "eventUri": "eng-9805231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Prior to that, they'd won gold in the same event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games.\n\nCanada had previously won the gold medal at the 2022 World Championships with the exact same roster, beating the Americans on home soil in Eugene, Oregon.\n\nDespite their longtime chemistry, the Canadians weren't exactly favoured going into Sunday's final.

With Andre De Grasse running the anchor leg, the Canadians posted a winning time of 37.5 seconds in Friday's final. South Africa was second in 37.57 seconds and Britain third in 37.61.

It is clear that EVERYONE at @usatf (the US track and field federation) is more concerned with relationships than winning.\n\n\"No athlete should step on the track and run another relay until this

Subscribe here to get the latest on the Paris Olympics in your inbox every day.\n\nIt was shaping up as a rough day for Canada's track and field athletes. This morning, men's 5,000m medal contender Moh Ahmed was eliminated when he tripped on another runner with about a lap left in his heat. A few hours later, reigning 200m champion Andre De Grasse lost his title when he failed to advance past the semifinals.\n\nBut, just when it looked like Canada might go without a medal for the second time in three days, pole vaulter Alysha Newman won a surprising bronze in her first trip to the women's final in three Olympic appearances.\n\nBrimming with confidence and radiating joy even when she didn't get over the bar successfully, the striking 30-year-old athlete/um...internet-modelling entrepreneur cleared a national-record 4.85 metres to become the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic pole vault medal (no Canadian man has done it since 1912).\n\nNina Kennedy of Australia (4.90) took the gold ahead of defending Olympic champion Katie Moon of the United States (4.85 with one less miss than Newman). Kennedy and Moon shared the gold at last year's world championships.\n\nWATCH | Newman cashes Canada's lone medal on Day 12:\n\nNewman's delightful bronze brought Canada's medal count to 19 (six gold, four silver, nine bronze) through 12 full days of competition. That's five\n\nmedals away from matching the national record for a non-boycotted Summer Games, set three years ago in Tokyo, with four days left.\n\nDay 13 brings podium chances for Canadians in an array of lesser-followed sports like weightlifting, track cycling and taekwondo. Plus, Canada can clinch its first Olympic beach volleyball medal of this century.\n\nBefore we get to that stuff, let's look ahead to an interesting Thursday in track and field while recapping the rest of a chaotic day at the Stade de France.\n\nIt's been a tough Games for Canada's biggest track star. Before this, De Grasse had never failed to win a medal in an Olympic event, going 3-for-3 in both Rio and Tokyo -- highlighted by his gold in the 200m three summers ago. In Paris, he's 0-for-2 at even making the finals after being eliminated in the 100m semifinals on Sunday and, today, the 200m semis.\n\nDe Grasse finished third in his heat in 20.41 seconds -- his worst time of the season and borderline glacial for someone who ran a 19.62 in Tokyo and a 19.76 to win the Diamond League Final just last year.\n\nThe silver lining to De Grasse's failure to qualify for Thursday's 200m final is it frees him up to go all out in the men's 4x100m heats earlier in the day. Realistically, the relay was always his best hope for a medal in Paris anyway.\n\nHowever, De Grasse said he \"reaggravated\" a hamstring injury during his 200m semifinal. \"The pain was too much, so I couldn't even push,\" he told trackside reporter Devin Heroux. But Canada's top sprinter sounded optimistic about his status for the relay. \"It doesn't hurt as much on the straights,\" said De Grasse, who normally runs the less-bendy anchor leg.\n\nWATCH | De Grasse's 200m Olympic title defence ends in semifinals:\n\nDe Grasse's relay teammates Brendon Rodney and Aaron Brown also failed to advance in the 200m, placing fifth and seventh in their heats. American Noah Lyles remains favoured to win gold after capturing the 100m title on Sunday. The 200m final is at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe men's 4x100 heats begin at 5:35 a.m. ET. Canada also has a team in the women's 4x100 heats at 5:10 a.m. ET. Also in the morning session, women's shot put medal contender Sarah Mitton competes in her qualifying round at 4:25 a.m. ET.\n\nLater, young Canadian record holder Savannah Sutherland runs in the women's 400m hurdles final at 3:25 p.m. ET. American Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone is favoured to repeat as Olympic champion.\n\nEarlier today, Canada's Moh Ahmed was eliminated from the men's 5,000m after he tripped on another runner's foot and went down with a little more than a lap left in his heat. \"I ate it hard,\" said Ahmed, who won silver in the 5,000 in Tokyo and looked like a contender here after placing fourth in a scorching 10,000 final last week. He appealed for a berth in Saturday's final, but it was denied by the officials, who allowed four other runners from the heat to advance after they hit the deck in a separate crash with less than 100m to go.\n\nCanada's Thomas Fafard qualified by placing eighth in that disastrous race. Canadian road 5K record holder Ben Flanagan did not advance after finishing 17th in the other heat, where an oblivious cameraman wandered onto the track and got in the way of several runners.\n\nWATCH | De Grasse says he may have run 200m semifinal with injury:\n\nThings went more smoothly for Canada's Marco Arop in the first round of the men's 800m. The world champion placed second in his heat to move on to Friday's semifinals. Arop's main rivals -- Djamel Sedjati of Algeria, Emmanuel Wanyonyi of Kenya, Gabriel Tual of France and Ben Pattison of Great Britain -- all won their heats.\n\nAlso today, Canada's Evan Dunfee and Olivia Lundman finished 20th in the mixed race walk relay, while Olympic rookie Jean-Simon Desgagnes placed 13th in the men's 3,000m steeplechase final. There was a frightening scene near the end of that race when world-record holder Lamecha Girma clipped his leg on a late hurdle and crashed incredibly hard. The Ethiopian was taken off on a stretcher, motionless. Morocco's Soufiane El Bakkali won his second consecutive Olympic gold.\n\nAmerican Quincy Hall stole the men's 400m with a devastating kick to nip Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith, whose European-record time of 43.44 seconds was bettered by Hall's personal-best 43.40.\n\nWeightlifting: Maude Charron in the women's 59kg event\n\nCharron won gold three years ago in Tokyo, becoming just the second Canadian to capture an Olympic weightlifting title. But that came in the 64kg division, which was eliminated from the program, forcing Charron to drop down in weight.\n\nCanada's co-flag-bearer for the opening ceremony in Paris remains a contender in her new weight class. She took bronze at the 2022 world championships and, after missing the 2023 worlds with a knee injury, returned to take silver at the Pan Am Games later in the year. The competition starts at 9 a.m. ET. Here's more on Charron.\n\nTrack cycling: Kelsey Mitchell, Lauriane Genest and Dylan Bibic in two events\n\nMitchell and Genest advanced to the women's keirin quarterfinals at 11:18 a.m. ET. They'll try to qualify for the semis an hour later and the medal race for the top six riders at 1:11 p.m. ET. Genest was the bronze medallist in this event at the 2021 Olympics, while Mitchell won gold in the sprint.\n\nBibic is a contender in the men's omnium, a gruelling four-stage event starting at 11 a.m. ET. The 21-year-old won gold in the men's scratch race at the 2022 world championships and took silver in the elimination race at last year's worlds. Those events are not in the Olympics as separate competitions, but they're both part of the omnium. Watch this video for more on Bibic.\n\nTaekwondo: Skylar Park in the women's 57kg event\n\nPark is seeded fourth in her 16-fighter bracket after winning her first gold on the prestigious Grand Prix circuit last year and adding the Pan Am Games title. She'll face 13th-seeded Czech Dominika Hronova at 3:09 a.m. ET.\n\nThe medal bouts are at 2:34 p.m. ET (bronze) and 3:37 p.m. ET (gold).\n\nBeach volleyball: Melissa Humana-Paredes and Brandie Wilkerson in the women's semifinals\n\nCanada's top beach duo got off to a rough start in Paris, losing two of their three group-stage matches. But they've been lights-out ever since, winning three straight elimination games at Eiffel Tower Stadium. Today, the seventh-ranked team defeated a 16th-ranked Spanish pair in straight sets to become the first Canadian women's beach volleyballers to reach the final four at the Olympics.\n\nHumana-Paredes and Wilkerson will face the ninth-ranked Swiss team of Tanja Huberli and Nina Brunner at 11 a.m. ET. Win or lose, they'll go on to play for Canada's first beach volleyball medal since John Child and Mark Heese won the men's bronze in the sport's Olympic debut in 1996.\n\nWATCH | Humana-Paredes and Wilkerson hunt for medal in beach volleyball semis:\n\nA Canadian is near the top of the leaderboard in women's golf -- just not the one you think.\n\nBrooke Henderson is the top Canadian playing this week at Le Golf National. She's a two-time major champion with 13 LPGA Tour titles to her name and is ranked a Canadian-best 17th in the world. But Henderson had an up-and-down opening round today, to say the least. She carded six bogeys, a double bogey and four birdies before draining an 48-foot eagle putt on the final hole to end up with a 2-over 74 -- tied for 30th in the 60-player tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, 248th-ranked Alena Sharp birdied the final two holes for a 1-under 71 -- tied for seventh. France's Celine Boutier fired a 7-under 65 for a three-shot lead on the field. Here's more on today's golf.\n\nLive events are televised on the CBC TV network, TSN and Sportsnet.

It feels good to bring it to fruition. I'm super grateful.\"\n\nBrown added: \"Individuals didn't go our way but when we come together we're a real strong team. You can never count us out, we feel great.\"\n\nDefending champions Italy, featuring Tokyo's individual 100m champion Marcell Jacobs on the second leg, finished fourth in 37.68sec.\n\n'Just didn't happen'\n\nThe United States, missing Covid-hit 100m champion Noah Lyles, initially crossed the line in seventh in 37.89, but were later disqualified.\n\nChristian Coleman botched the first baton handover with Kenny Bednarek, the latter coming to an almost total standstill.\n\nKyree King and Fred Kerley could do nothing to drag the quartet back into the running.\n\n\"It just didn't happen,\" said Coleman. \"Maybe we could have put in some more work, it just didn't happen.\n\n\"We practised a lot. Me and Kenny have been awesome teammates a few times over the years. We felt really confident. It just didn't happen.\n\n\"We're our own biggest critic. We're disappointed because we know we had the speed to do it. It's part of the sport that you come into it with the risk reward.\"\n\nBednarek added: \"At the end of the day we knew what we could do, we came out here with a mindset of no risk, no reward. It didn't happen, it is what it is.\"\n\nKerley, who won 100m bronze in Paris, said a downpour had not affected the relay.\n\n\"We train in rain, the weather doesn't affect anything,\" he said. \"We're here to perform. We didn't get the job time. We're not disappointed, we've just got to learn from this and keep going.\"\n\nIt continues the sprint powerhouse's dismal Olympic run.\n\nThe last time the US men medalled was with a silver at the 2004 Athens Games.\n\nThere was a botched handoff in the heats of the 2021 Tokyo Games, while the US were disqualified at the 2016 Rio Games and failed to medal in London in 2012 whilst also coming a cropper in the semi-finals in Beijing in 2008.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That tied the record for a non-boycotted Games Canadian athletes first set in 1992 and equalled three years ago in Tokyo.\n\nIt also gave Canada 23 medals overall. With Melissa Humana-Paredes and Brandie Wilkerson set to play in the women's beach volleyball later Friday, Canada was guaranteed to finish Day 14 of the games equal with the 24 medals won in Tokyo. That was also a record for a non-boycotted Games.\n\nIt was also a measure of redemption for De Grasse. The 29-year-old from Markham, Ont., is now tied with swimmer Penny Oleksiak as Canada's most decorated Olympian with seven medals (two gold, two silver, three bronze).\n\nDe Grasse failed to qualify for the finals of either the 200 metres, which he won in Tokyo, or the 100 in Paris after not missing a final -- or a podium -- in any of his previous Olympic events.\n\nBut Canada has proven to be a well-oiled machine in the relay. The four sprinters combined to win the world championship in 2022 in Eugene, Ore., and De Grasse, Rodney and Brown were relay silver medallists in Tokyo.\n\n\"It feels pretty amazing. To be out with these guys, my brothers, I've been with them since the beginning of time, so it's amazing,\" said De Grasse.\n\n\"We talked about this moment for years. It feels good to bring it to fruition. I'm super grateful.\"\n\nDe Grasse also moved past Carl Lewis for second overall in career sprint and relay Olympic medals and is one short of the all-time mark set by the legendary Usain Bolt.\n\nIt was Canada's second medal of the day after Katie Vincent of Mississauga, Ont., teamed with Sloan MacKenzie of Windsor Junction, N.S., to take the bronze medal in the women's sprint canoe double 500-metre final.\n\nIt's Vincent's second Olympic bronze in the event after finishing third with three years ago in Tokyo.\n\nThe Canadians lost the silver medal to the Ukrainians in a photo finish and posted a time of one minute 54.36 seconds. Liudmyla Luzan and Anastasiia Rybachok had a late burst to take silver with 1:54.30.\n\nChina's Shixiao Xu and Mengya Sun won gold with a time of 1:52.81. The Chinese beat the Olympic record they set in the semifinals after Vincent and MacKenzie set the Olympic mark in the heats.\n\n\"Oh, man. That Chinese crew, they've got it all figured out,\" Vincent said. \"They have been pretty perfect for the last three years, haven't had a slip. So I'm honestly just so proud to see our sport at that level.\"\n\nThere was disappointment as well, as Sarah Mitton failed to add to Canada's throwing success when she finished last in the 12-athlete final of the women's shot put.\n\nMitton, from Brooklyn, N.S., won silver in the event at the 2023 world championships and was considered one of Canada's strongest medal contenders entering the Paris Games.\n\nAlso Friday, Derek Drouin of Corunna, Ont., was presented a silver medal in high jump from the London 2012 Olympics in a ceremony featuring athletes receiving reallocated medals from previous Games.\n\nIn women's golf, Brooke Henderson of Smiths Falls, Ont., had an impressive third round to give herself an outside shot of a medal. Henderson shot 5-under Friday to give her a combined score of 2-under heading into Saturday's final round.\n\nNew Zealand's Lydia Ko and Switzerland's Morgane Metraux led at 9 under, two strokes ahead of Rose Zhang of the United States and Japan's Miyuu Yamashita.\n\n\"I mean, I'm still pretty far back, but it was nice to get the jump that I did today and move up as much as I did,\" said Henderson, who moved 16 spots up the leaderboard into a tie for 13th. \"I feel like a lot can happen and (there could be) a lot of movement, especially on Sunday afternoon. So I feel like, right to the end, I'll have a shot at it.\"\n\nIn diving, Rylan Wiens of Pike Lake, Sask., was third in preliminaries and qualified for Saturday's semifinal in the men's 10-metre platform. Nathan Zsombor-Murray, of Pointe-Claire, Que., secured 10th place and also advanced.\n\nThe two Canadians teamed up to win the bronze medal in the synchro event earlier at the Games.\n\nDrouin was among 10 past Olympians at the Trocadero who received new or upgraded medals in a ceremony. He originally finished third in London but was upgraded after Russia's Ivan Ukhov was stripped of the gold for a doping violation.\n\nDrouin said he didn't have any negative feelings toward Ukhov, who he said was part of a Russian doping scandal that was \"much more widespread than just any one individual athlete.\"\n\n\"I don't harbour any ill will toward him,\" he said. \"I don't think really any individual athlete in this scenario can really be, or should really be, held accountable in the way that maybe other doping scandals have been.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 9, 2024.\n\nThe Canadian Press", "source": {"uri": "orilliamatters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OrilliaMatters.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@orilliamatters.com",

His arrogant response is now going viral.\n\n\"Who? Who?\" he said dismissively when asked about Canada, as his American teammates laughed.\n\nHe's not laughing anymore.\n\nCanadian Olympic race walker Evan Dunfee was quick to share the video on social media after his country captured the gold.\n\nLyles did not run for USA in the 4 x 100m relay today as he has recently been diagnosed with COVID. He's one of the biggest personalities in the world of athletics and is not afraid to speak his mind.\n\nCanada secured the top spot with a massive anchor leg by Olympic legend Andre De Grasse, who ran the final 100m in 8.89 seconds despite dealing with a nagging hamstring injury. The sprinter has now tied Penny Oleksiak for the most Olympic medals won all-time by a Canadian, with seven.\n\nThe United States didn't even finish on the podium this year, as they were disqualified after a broken handoff. Canada, meanwhile, managed to take the gold despite none of their runners qualifying for the individual 100m final.\n\nDe Grasse celebrated on social media after the race with a short tweet comprised only of emojis. It's the second gold medal of his Olympic career as he also won the 200m dash at Tokyo 2020.", "source": {"uri": "dailyhive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailyhive.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_strang@dailyhive.com", "name": "Noah Strang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Dunfee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evan Dunfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racewalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racewalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Oleksiak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penny Oleksiak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_leg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anchor leg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.dailyhive.com/20240809115457/usa-canada-olympics-relay-500x258.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805231", "eventUri": "eng-9805231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

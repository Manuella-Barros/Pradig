{"id": 231969184, "title": "Virginia has the biggest data center market in the world. Can it also decarbonize its grid?", "text": "While short-lived, the denial came as a surprise. This March, Loudoun County, a suburb of Washington, D.C. in northern Virginia that is home to the greatest concentration of data centers in the world, made an unexpected move: It rejected a proposal to let a company build a bigger data center than existing zoning automatically allowed. \u201cAt some point we have to say stop,\u201d said Loudoun Supervisor Michael Turner during the meeting, as reported by news site LoudounNow. \u201cWe do not have enough power to power the data centers we have.\u201d County supervisors would later reverse the decision, approving a smaller version of the project. But the initial denial sent ripples throughout Virginia, where concern over the rapid growth of data centers and what that means for the state\u2019s ambitious decarbonization goals is growing. \u201cIt is really a salient issue for climate right now,\u201d said Tim Cywinski, a spokesperson for the Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, which has been vocal about its desire to slow down data center development in the state. \u201cThe data center industry is about 2 percent of global carbon emissions. \u2026 In about two years, I think it will surpass the airline industry.\u201d Dominion Energy, Virginia\u2019s largest electric utility, has forecast that data centers will be the most significant driver of rising energy demand in the state over the next 15 years. And while the utility has pledged it will decarbonize its Virginia grid by 2045, in line with the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed by the state legislature in 2020, it has also indicated in its most recent long-range plan for utility regulators that new natural gas plants will be needed to meet demand. \u201cWe are 100 percent committed to achieving the goals of the VCEA. We are not taking our foot off the accelerator with renewables,\u201d said Aaron Ruby, a spokesperson for Dominion. But, he added, \u201cthe clean energy transition is more challenging than it was a few years ago. The inescapable reality is we are experiencing unprecedented growth in electric demand.\u201d While some environmentalists say the skyrocketing data center growth threatens Virginia\u2019s ability to go zero-carbon, others say it can be done \u2014 but it will require new ways of managing the grid. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not a question of data centers or clean energy,\u201d said Nate Benforado, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. \u201cI think there is a path forward if we make some improvements.\u201d \u2018They just continue to come\u2019 Data centers and Virginia have been hand in glove for almost three decades, since companies like MAE-East, Equinix, and AOL built some of the earliest modern facilities in the Washington, D.C. suburbs. With close proximity to the federal government and the defense firms ringing it, Northern Virginia \u2014 and especially Ashburn in Loudoun County, known as \u201cData Center Alley\u201d \u2014 quickly became the beating heart of the U.S. data center industry. \u201cThere are data centers located in other areas of Virginia, but roughly 80 percent of the industry is located in Loudoun County,\u201d Dominion wrote in a recent long-term plan submitted to state regulators. \u201cTo put this in perspective, the aggregate of the next six largest data center markets in the U.S. is not as big as Loudoun County\u2019s market.\u201d Lawmakers have embraced the business. Beginning in 2010, Virginia exempted data centers from sales and use tax for many of the key components of their business as long as they met certain criteria: They had to invest at least $150 million in their facility, create 50 new jobs in the locality where it was sited and pay at least 150 percent of the prevailing annual average wage. The exemption remains Virginia\u2019s largest economic development incentive. The gambit worked. A 2019 report by Virginia\u2019s legislative watchdog, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, found the exemption \u201chas a sizable influence\u201d in attracting data centers to the state. It also has a \u201cmoderate economic benefit\u201d for the state, generating about $27 million in Virginia gross domestic product for every $1 million in foregone tax revenue, JLARC concluded. But as data centers have continued to flock to Virginia, concerns have increased. In Loudoun and neighboring Prince William County, residents complain the facilities\u2019 24/7 operations produce a constant humming that never stops. Conservationists fear the centers\u2019 expanding footprint is consuming too much land, while their heavy water use could strain local supplies. How to deal with the facilities\u2019 power use is also an increasingly urgent question. Data centers are highly electricity-intensive, requiring a steady stream of power to operate around the clock. As the industry expands, more electricity is needed to meet their demand, triggering the construction of not only new sources of power but transmission lines to carry that power from where it\u2019s generated to where it\u2019s used. Data center representatives have pointed out many companies in the space have been active drivers of renewables development across the nation. In a statement, Data Center Coalition President Josh Levi noted two-thirds of the renewable power bought by U.S. corporations has been wind and solar contracted to data centers and their customers. Companies have also set their own goals: Google aims to operate its data centers on carbon-free energy by 2030, while Amazon is pushing for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. \u201cData centers are highly efficient facilities that enable energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users,\u201d said Levi. Many, he added, are \u201con pace to achieve voluntary clean energy targets that predate and outpace many state mandates and targets.\u201d \u2018Absolutely phenomenal\u2019 Even with those commitments, the sheer magnitude of the facilities\u2019 growth in Virginia poses a challenge for utilities, and particularly Dominion. While data centers\u2019 peak energy usage in 2022 was almost 2.8 gigawatts \u2014 roughly one and a half times the power produced at Dominion\u2019s largest Virginia plant, the North Anna nuclear facility in Louisa County \u2014 the company forecasts they will require roughly 13.3 gigawatts by 2038. Much of that may be due to Amazon Web Services, which Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin last year announced intends to invest $35 billion in data center campuses in the state by 2040, although Dominion does not disclose information about specific customers. \u201cThe amount of data center load growth we\u2019re dealing with is absolutely phenomenal,\u201d said Devi Glick, a principal at consultancy Synapse Energy Economics, who testified for the Sierra Club at hearings in Richmond this September on the utility\u2019s Integrated Resource Plan, a nonbinding roadmap for how it intends to meet customer demand over the next 15 years. \u201cEverything we\u2019re dealing with is massive and kind of, like, novel.\u201d Some environmental groups have challenged the accuracy of Dominion\u2019s forecasts, arguing the utility is overestimating future growth as a way to justify keeping existing natural gas plants running and build new ones, including a proposed peaker plant in Chesterfield County. Others, including the nonprofit Appalachian Voices, say the forecast is shakier than it appears because so much of the expected demand comes from a very small number of companies. According to figures from Dominion, two firms account for 62 percent of the demand the utility expects to see from data centers in 2030. Five account for 80 percent. \u201cIf even one of those five companies changes its growth plans, or if one or more counties in northern Virginia takes an aggressively hostile turn against data center expansion, the actual growth in Virginia could be radically different from what Dominion estimates now,\u201d wrote Rachel James, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center representing Appalachian Voices, this October. Despite those disagreements, there\u2019s little debate that in the near term, data centers\u2019 electricity demand is skyrocketing. Dominion Vice President of Strategic Partnerships Alan Bradshaw told regulators this September that data centers have signed electric service agreements with Dominion that call for the utility to provide over 5.8 gigawatts to various new facilities by 2032. Bradshaw said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data center customer in Dominion territory abandoning a project after such an agreement had been signed. Over 10 additional gigawatts are in earlier stages of development by companies working with Dominion to obtain power for future projects. \u201cThis week we\u2019ve had an executive meeting with a new entrant on the market, and they want to add two campuses that have 1.2 gigawatts of load,\u201d Bradshaw said at the September 21 hearing. \u201cLiterally on the way to the courthouse today, we had another customer call us about a half-gigawatt campus they want to meet with us on. So they just continue to come.\u201d Zero-carbon or the cloud? But while economic development boosters see the uptick in investment as a boon for state and local coffers, environmental groups say if left unchecked, the growth threatens Virginia\u2019s ability to decarbonize its electric grid by 2050. \u201cWe have to make the hard choice about what data centers look like in Virginia now and if it\u2019s worth the cost,\u201d said Cywinski of the Sierra Club. \u201cAnd right now, we think it\u2019s not.\u201d All of the long-range plans Dominion presented to regulators last year included new natural gas capacity, ranging anywhere from 970 to 2,900 megawatts of the fuel, an approach the company has defended as necessary to ensure reliability. \u201cThere is no realistic way that we can serve all this growth, keep our customers\u2019 power on around the clock, and only do it with renewables,\u201d said Ruby, the Dominion spokesman. \u201cThat is just not realistically possible.\u201d Ruby said the utility\u2019s calculus isn\u2019t just based on available megawatts. It\u2019s also a matter, he said, of how quickly units can be brought online to meet demand in a crisis. Solar and wind can\u2019t produce electricity around the clock, and while nuclear will remain a mainstay of Virginia power supply \u2014 it currently accounts for about a third of Dominion\u2019s Virginia capacity \u2014 both the North Anna and Surry plants require hours to ramp up. In contrast, he said, with a natural gas plant like the new Chesterfield facility the utility has proposed, \u201cwe can ramp that up and dispatch 1,000 megawatts to the grid in 10 to 20 minutes.\u201d Environmental groups, however, say Dominion shouldn\u2019t be planning to expand its carbon resources in the long term given state law requiring the utility to stop emitting carbon by the middle of the century. \u201cThe transition to clean energy, that is the commonwealth\u2019s policy. It is in the law. That is what we are working toward,\u201d said Benforado, who along with James represented Appalachian Voices in the September case. How data centers\u2019 rising power demands may impact Virginia\u2019s ability to transition from fossil fuels to renewables is one of the issues the state\u2019s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission is tasked with assessing this year. And although lawmakers put forward more than a dozen proposals related to data centers during the last legislative session, the General Assembly delayed consideration of most until the next session, after the state study\u2019s release. Among the bills put forward were proposals to require data centers to meet certain energy efficiency targets to qualify for state tax incentives and have local governments study the regional grid impacts of potential facilities. \u201cThe JLARC study really sucked the wind out of a lot of these,\u201d said Benforado. In regulatory proceedings, Appalachian Voices and the Sierra Club have argued that rather than building new gas plants, Dominion should explore other ways to meet data centers\u2019 power needs. Proposals include demand response programs that let energy consumers shift or reduce their power usage during times of high demand, such as extremely cold or hot weather. The environmental groups also argued for long-duration battery storage, an emerging but limited technology, and transmission upgrades. \u201cI think we need much more sophisticated planning that looks at lots of options, lots of tools,\u201d said Benforado. \u201cI do not accept this idea that we have to build gas. \u2026 To me, that\u2019s not backed up by analysis.\u201d With as many as 11 gigawatts of power needed over the next 15 years to supply data centers, he said, \u201cI think this is the time we need to refocus our efforts.\u201d \u201cClean energy aside, if you don\u2019t have smart planning, optimized solutions, it\u2019s going to be really expensive to supply 11 gigawatts,\u201d he said. Levi of the Data Center Coalition noted that \u201cgrid planning and management is ultimately the role of utilities and grid operators.\u201d However, he said the industry \u201cis committed to leaning in as an engaged partner.\u201d Rising tensions could complicate the search for solutions. Local conflicts over the industry have led to the ousting of at least one official in Prince William County, and in December 2023, 25 nonprofits and other groups, including the Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, announced they were forming the Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition to seek more regulation of data centers. Still, Benforado said he believed \u201cwin-win solutions\u201d could be found in partnership with the industry. \u201cI think they\u2019re motivated,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they\u2019re motivated.\u201d", "summary": "Dominion Energy, the state\u2019s largest utility, says new natural gas plants will be needed to meet rising electricity demand, while the state studies how this booming sector will impact Virginia\u2019s transition to renewable energy.", "url": "https://grist.org/energy/virginia-has-the-biggest-data-center-market-in-the-world-can-it-also-decarbonize-its-grid/", "image": "https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AmazonDataCenter.jpg?quality=75&strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:00:00", "author": "Inside Climate News,Sarah Vogelsong", "authors": ["Inside Climate News", "Sarah Vogelsong"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.043}

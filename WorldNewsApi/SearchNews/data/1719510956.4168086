In less capable hands, he would\u2019ve been a buffoonish caricature, but not on Jensen Ackles\u2019 watch. The actor arrived on the Supernatural set with hundreds of Days of Our Lives episodes under his belt, having played Eric Brady, Sami\u2019s twin brother, from 1997 to 2000. He also had recurring roles on shows like Dark Angel, Dawson\u2019s Creek, and Smallville. But once he slid behind the wheel of Baby, he stayed for a decade and a half. \u201cThere was a reason why I think we all stuck around though, because we just truly enjoyed it,\u201d Ackles said on Late Night With Seth Meyers in 2022. \u201cIt was a family.\u201d The family connection was literally true for Ackles, whose wife, Danneel, made her Supernatural debut in season 13 as faith healer Sister Jo, the human vessel of the angel Anael. The pair married in 2010 and have three children. Since the end of Supernatural, he has carried a (legitimate) badge as Sheriff Beau Arlen in Big Sky (2022\u20132023); reprised his role as Dean for The Winchesters (2022\u20132023), the single-season Supernatural spinoff that the Ackles executive produced; and fondly patted a classic Impala in season 1 of Tracker. He also notably stepped into some familiar shoes as Soldier Boy in The Boys (2022) and its spinoff, Gen V (2023). \u201cI somehow managed to end with the same kind of boots for Soldier Boy that I wore as Dean Winchester,\u201d Ackles told EW in 2020. \u201cDifferent color but same boot.\u201d", "summary": "The actors have stayed busy since they stepped away from saving people and hunting things \u2014 you know, the family business.", "url": "https://ew.com/supernatural-cast-where-are-they-now-8653980", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/A8FPIJLiuytL1lsIueeLhYuFx98=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/supernatural-tout-052324-1304a476e9ef4ff7b3bca062a442aaab.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:00:00", "author": "Sara Netzley", "authors": ["Sara Netzley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.063}

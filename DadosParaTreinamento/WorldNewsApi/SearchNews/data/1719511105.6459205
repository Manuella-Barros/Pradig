The seasoned host, 64, has presented the ITV show since However, in the wake of the news about her sad split with husband, Eamonn Holmes, also 64, Ruth is said to be 'stepping back' from the show. Following months of speculation surrounding the couple, a representative announced on behalf of the former This Morning stars that they were getting a divorce. After the news, which sent shockwaves through the showbiz world, Eamonn is said to be set to return to GB News on Monday. However, Ruth is choosing to stay off air a little longer - at least for a week. Her husband, however, is said to be gearing up to tell all about his second divorce when he returns to GB News on Monday. A source said the TV presenter knows fans will want to hear from him and he will not shy away from sharing his side. \u201cEamonn is always frank on camera and knows it will be odd for him to discuss the day\u2019s news without mentioning his split so he\u2019ll say a few words. He is putting on a brave face and will be the true professional he always is. Focusing on work will be a welcome distraction,\" they told The Sun. It's now been reported that the Belfast-born star had become \"more and more grumpy\" in recent years following his well-documented battle with chronic back pain. Speaking about the dad-of-four's ill health, following his surgery for a slipped disc and hip replacement, a friend of the couple said Ruth had become more of a carer to her husband in recent years. They shared: \"Ruth has become more his carer than a wife. Eamonn has been thoroughly miserable. He has had a torrid time with his health, he's in constant pain, and the truth is he can't contain how miserable it makes him,\" reports MailOnline. Eamonn speaks candidly about his \"chronic pain\" on X, formerly Twitter, after undergoing spinal surgery in 2022 and a double-hip replacement in 2016. Claiming Ruth has \"borne the brunt of much of his anger and frustration in recent years\", the source says \"something had to give\". They continued: \"In the end it just started to get her [Ruth] down more than she could accept.She needs her own life. It's a case of her wanting to get out and enjoy herself. Women at Ruth's age realise that they only have ten, 20, 30 years max left and they want to have some fun.\" The friend claims Ruth and Eamonn had remained living under the same roof, but were sleeping in separate rooms. However, it's since been reported the Northern Irishman has walked out of their \u00a33.25million Surrey mansion and is now living at a property nearby.

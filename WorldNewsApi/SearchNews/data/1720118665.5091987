The driver showed signs of possible impairment, giving the officer her Social Security number, and explaining that the car belonged to her daughter, the front-seat passenger, who also had her children, an infant and a toddler in the back seat. Asked if there were weapons in the car, the grandmother said her Sig Sauer handgun was under the passenger seat. Police found the magazine containing four rounds was not inserted. The daughter said she also had a gun in her purse, found on the backseat floor between her children and containing a Smith & Wesson Springfield model loaded with 15 rounds. They said they were coming back from a Pinecrest eatery, where the driver later said she\u2019d had a martini, in addition to beers and shots of vodka. Police found an empty bottle of Tito\u2019s in the car, along with various emptied or partially consumed beers. The daughter was deemed to be highly intoxicated as well, and arrangements were made with police to have an aunt pick her and the children up. The car was towed and the grandmother taken to the Solon jail, where she refused a Breathalyzer, leading to an additional drunk driving charge for having a prior conviction in 2017. Theft from mail, fraud, forgery: Lander Road A resident came to the police station May 17 to report that she wrote a check out for $63.80 in late March to United Health Care, dropping it in a mailbox either on Lander Circle or in Bainbridge Township. She later discovered that the Huntington Bank personal check had been altered and made payable to a man she did not know for $4,795.66. The fraudulent check was deposited to a PNC account through a mobile deposit app, with the investigation continuing. Damage to property, Capital Hill Circle Police responded to a report of a street light falling down and striking a parked 2021 GMC Terrain at 8:18 p.m. May 26. Officers moved the pole off the roadway and cordoned the area with safety tape, contacting the Village Service Department and the electric company. Traffic stop, no license plate, no driver\u2019s license: Harvard Road A patrol officer stopped a westbound Toyota Sienna with no visible license plate around 9:15 p.m. on the I-271 southbound entrance ramp, and found that the driver did not speak English. He called his wife, who is conversant, and he gave his name, also providing a Mexican passport. The officer had dispatchers run an Immigration Alien Transaction (IAQ), which came back showing the driver was considered an illegal alien. But upon reporting the information to U.S. Enforcement and Removal Operations (EOR), agents there said they were not interested in picking him up at this time. With no driver\u2019s license or plates, he was issued tickets and given a Bedford Municipal Court date, with his thumbprint placed on the back of the citation. The car was towed and he was given a courtesy ride to Village Hall to be picked up by his wife.

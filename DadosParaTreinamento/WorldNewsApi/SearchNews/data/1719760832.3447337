One such product is Liquid Gold, an exfoliating treatment shoppers say made their skin 'glow'. It also helps to reduce age spots, fine lines and wrinkles and the best-selling Alpha-H product has recently had a makeover with new 100% recyclable packaging. The Liquid Gold anti-ageing toner, which is available at M&S as well as directly from the brand, contains 5% Glycolic Acid which works by gently exfoliating the skin to clear out pollution build-up and dead skin cells. According to Alpha H, the \u00a342.99 product also 'reveals skin that is brighter....while reducing the appearance of fine lines'. Users' own reviews of Liquid Gold certainly prove it helps, with many recommending the high-end bottle.

It's perfect for my skin as it's a gentle exfoliant so it doesn't cause irritation to inflamed pimples, and actually helps to dry them out and get rid of them faster.\" A second person, who branded it 'magic in a bottle' said: \"The biggest difference in my skin has been since I started using this product and I\u2019ll never stop\", while a third person shared how they'd seen a huge improvement after three months of using the product: \"I only have to use it twice a week but I have already seen great results.\" Another shopper said: \"I am going to be 55 in August. This product is absolutely incredible. It is worth its weight in gold, \"no pun intended\". My skin on my neck and jawline is tighter and lifted. \"My skin feels smooth and looks radiant. In only 10 minutes after applying this product, you can see a difference in the mirror. I absolutely recommend this product.\" Acid based toners can be quite harsh on the skin, so with any brand it is recommended users build up the use of it over time, starting off with a small amount. Alpha H suggests drenching a cotton pad with the product and wiping it over the face and neck after cleansing. Once done, it is normal for the Liquid Gold treatment to tingle the skin which should last around three seconds. It's this sensation that has caused a few users to give the product negative reviews online, as they \"don't like the feeling on their skin\". Not all shoppers are so instantly impressed, one said that it didn't have a huge impact on her brown spots. She said: \"I have a lot of sun damage due to lack of sun tan lotion in the 70s. \"On my second bottle and improvement on my neck wrinkles for sure, brown spots minimal improvement, but will continue. My skin appears brighter on the whole. But hey you cannot expect miracles.\" It's even popular amongst American beauty experts including Donna Francis, an award-winning Beauty Editor for over 25 years and currently Beauty Ed at Hello Magazine in the US. Donna says she has been using Alpha-H Liquid Gold for years. She said: \"I have been using Liquid Gold for well over 10 years after being introduced to it at a beauty event in London while I was Beauty Editor at InStyle magazine. Since then, I have written about it in many articles for magazines and newspapers as well as on my Instagram and TikTok feeds. \"I am 47 and have never had Botox - which is rare in my industry - so I need my skincare to work really hard and Liquid Gold ticks all of the right boxes. It gives glow while not being too harsh on my skin. \"It\u2019s super easy to use and the results appear fast. Plus I know that Alpha-H uses the best, quality ingredients so I know that I\u2019m caring and treating my skin with the best!\" Alternative products include Paula's Choice, which offers a similar liquid exfoliant option with its 2% BHA product or Amazon stocks The Inkey List Glycolic Acid 10% Toning Solution for \u00a39.75.", "summary": "The Alpha-H beauty product has built up a cult following over the years including beauty editors and now it has had a makeover", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/style/shopping/alpha-h-beauty-treatment-worth-32915387", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32916054.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Untitled-design-2024-05-29T122816117.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:07:08", "author": "Harriet Morphy-Morris,Harriet-morphy-morris", "authors": ["Harriet Morphy-Morris", "Harriet-morphy-morris"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.099}

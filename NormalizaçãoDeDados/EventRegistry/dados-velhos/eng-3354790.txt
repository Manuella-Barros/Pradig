She also was not identified by name.\n\nThe police statement says the submarine is lying in seven feet of water but divers have not been able to enter it safely yet.\n\nSwedish police are investigating the whereabouts of a missing woman who had been on a privately built submarine that sank off Denmark.\n\nSwedish and Danish media reported that the woman was a journalist who had been writing about the UC3 Nautilus' owner and builder, Peter Madsen.\n\nThe Danish navy rescued Madsen after launching a search for the submarine early Friday. He told authorities he had been alone on the vessel.\n\nNavy spokesman Anders Damgaard says Madsen \"told us that the journalist who also had been on board had been dropped off Thursday evening.\"\n\nIt was the woman's boyfriend who alerted authorities the submarine was missing early Friday.\n\nThe owner of a large, privately built submarine that sank south of Copenhagen says the vessel went down after a minor problem with a ballast tank turned into a major issue.\n\nPeter Madsen built the UC3 Nautilus and launched it in 2008. It was considered the largest privately submarine of its kind in the world.\n\nAfter being rescued by the Danish navy on Friday, the 46-year-old Madsen told Denmark's TV2 channel \"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down.\"\n\nThe ballast tank is a compartment that holds water, which is used as ballast to provide stability for a vessel.\n\nMadsen said that once the problem with the ballast tank started, \"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink and I couldn't close any hatches or anything.\"\n\nHe added: \"I guess that was pretty good because I otherwise still would have been down there.\"\n\nThe Danish navy says a crowdfunded, amateur-built submarine that was missing in Danish waters has sunk south of Copenhagen, but the owner and builder who was alone onboard is safe.\n\nThe navy initially said the 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) UC3 Nautilus was \"found sailing\" south of Copenhagen on Friday. However, navy press spokesman Anders Damgaard later said it had sunk and owner Peter Madsen \"taken over to one of our ships.\"\n\nDamgaard declined to give details.\n\nFootage aired on Denmark's TV2 channel showed the 46-year-old Madsen, 46, getting off what looked to be a private boat and making a thumbs up sign as he walked away. It was not clear why the submarine sank.\n\nA privately built submarine that was feared missing in Danish waters has been found and the crew is safe, the Danish navy said Friday.\n\nThe 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine with at least two people on board was \"found sailing\" south of Copenhagen, the navy tweeted. It called off the search for the UC3 Nautilus submarine in the area from Copenhagen to the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm with two helicopters and three ships.\n\nNavy spokesman Christer Haven earlier had said members of the public with boats and sonar equipment were urged to take part in the search.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear why the submarine crew failed to respond to radio contact.\n\nThe Danish navy says it is searching for a 40-ton, nearly 18-meter (60-foot) -long, privately built submarine in the waters off Copenhagen with at least two people on board.\n\nNavy spokesman Christer Haven says two helicopters and three ships are taking part in the search for the UC3 Nautilus submarine in the area from Copenhagen to the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm.\n\nHaven says members of the public with boats and sonar equipment have also been urged to take part in the search.\n\nHe said the search started after authorities got a call early Friday that the submarine had not returned to Copenhagen as planned. Owner Peter Madsen, who built the vessel that was launched in 2008, is believed to be on board along with a reporter.\n\nAn amateur-built submarine financed through crowdfunding sunk in Denmark's waters on Friday and the owner was found safe onboard, the Danish navy said.

Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nThe statement did not identify the owner, Peter Madsen, but he appeared on Danish television Friday to discuss the submarine's sinking.\n\nDeputy Police Inspector Jens Moller Jensen says investigators are looking for witnesses who may have seen the woman after the time Madsen reported she disembarked. She also was not identified by name.\n\nThe police statement says the submarine is lying in seven feet of water but divers have not been able to enter it safely yet.\n\nSwedish police are investigating the whereabouts of a missing woman who had been on a privately built submarine that sank off Denmark.\n\nSEC warns TSP participants of new scam\n\nSwedish and Danish media reported that the woman was a journalist who had been writing about the UC3 Nautilus' owner and builder, Peter Madsen.\n\nThe Danish navy rescued Madsen after launching a search for the submarine early Friday. He told authorities he had been alone on the vessel.\n\nNavy spokesman Anders Damgaard says Madsen \"told us that the journalist who also had been on board had been dropped off Thursday evening.\"\n\nIt was the woman's boyfriend who alerted authorities the submarine was missing early Friday.\n\nThe owner of a large, privately built submarine that sank south of Copenhagen says the vessel went down after a minor problem with a ballast tank turned into a major issue.\n\nPeter Madsen built the UC3 Nautilus and launched it in 2008. It was considered the largest privately submarine of its kind in the world.\n\nAfter being rescued by the Danish navy on Friday, the 46-year-old Madsen told Denmark's TV2 channel \"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down.\"\n\nThe ballast tank is a compartment that holds water, which is used as ballast to provide stability for a vessel.\n\nMadsen said that once the problem with the ballast tank started, \"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink and I couldn't close any hatches or anything.\"\n\nHe added: \"I guess that was pretty good because I otherwise still would have been down there.\"\n\nThe Danish navy says a crowdfunded, amateur-built submarine that was missing in Danish waters has sunk south of Copenhagen, but the owner and builder who was alone onboard is safe.\n\nThe navy initially said the 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) UC3 Nautilus was \"found sailing\" south of Copenhagen on Friday.

Owner Peter Madsen, who built the vessel that was launched in 2008, is believed to be on board along with a reporter.\n\nAn amateur-built submarine financed through crowdfunding sunk in Denmark's waters on Friday and the owner was found safe onboard, the Danish navy said. However, a Swedish journalist who had been on the vessel is reported missing.\n\nPeter Madsen, who built the UC3 Nautilus submarine that first was launched in 2008, was taken aboard a military ship, navy spokesman Anders Damgaard said.

Two helicopters and three ships combed the sea from Copenhagen to the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm.\n\nThe navy also encouraged members of the public with boats and sonar to search, too.\n\n\"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close any hatches or anything,\" Madsen said. \"But I guess that was pretty good because I otherwise still would have been down there.\"\n\nThe ballast tank is a compartment that holds water, which is used as ballast to provide stability for a vessel.\n\nThe navy initially said the sub was \"found sailing\" south of Copenhagen. But Damgaard later said the 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine had sunk.\n\nMadsen \"told us he had technical problems\" to explain why the submarine failed to respond to radio contact, Damgaard said.\n\nDanish media reported police sent divers down to the submarine.

It was the journalist's boyfriend who alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned from a test run, police said.\n\n\"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down,\" Madsen told Denmark's TV2 channel, which aired footage of him getting off what appeared to be a private boat and giving a thumbs-up sign.\n\nMadsen said \"a minor problem with a ballast tank\" -- a compartment that holds water to provide stability -- \"turned into a major issue\" that ultimately caused the submarine to sink.\n\n\"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close any hatches or anything,\" he said. \"But I guess that was pretty good, because I otherwise still would have been down there.\"\n\nSwedish police said later in the day they were investigating the whereabouts of a missing woman who had been on the submarine at some point.\n\n\"Whether the woman was on board the submarine at the time of her disappearance is unclear,\" police said in a statement.\n\nThe woman was a journalist writing about Madsen and his submarine, Swedish and Danish media reported.\n\n\"He told us that the journalist who also had been on board had been dropped off Thursday evening,\" Danish navy spokesman Anders Damgaard told The Associated Press. \"They were the only two on board yesterday.\"\n\nCopenhagen Deputy Police Inspector Jens Moller Jensen says investigators are looking for witnesses who may have seen the woman after the time Madsen reported she disembarked. She also was not identified by name.\n\nThe police statement said the submerged submarine was lying in seven feet of water, but divers had not been able to enter it safely as of Friday night. They were hoping to tow it to port on Saturday and open it then, the statement said.\n\nMadsen describes himself as an \"inventrepaneur\" on the website for his Copenhagen-based company. RML Spacelab is seeking to send people into space and is developing a rocket, floating launch pad and astronaut testing machine among other projects, the site says.\n\n\"My passion is finding ways to travel to worlds beyond the well-known,\" Madsen wrote on the site. \"I design and manufacture non-commercial extreme machines, employing teams of volunteering engineers and technicians to challenge the ordinary....\"\n\n\"The undersea world is close, it's beautiful, always just around the corner in Denmark. Diving, no matter the method, is very challenging and it*s technically difficult to go to beyond where rubber suits and scuba gear can take us.\"\n\nThe Nautilus set out from Refshale Island, a former shipyard redeveloped as an entertainment and activity spot, at about 7 p.m. local time on Thursday, according to a police timeline.\n\nTwo helicopters and three ships combed the sea from Copenhagen to the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm after police received the report it had not gotten back to land just after 3:30 a.m. It was spotted by a lighthouse in Koge Bay, a seaport south of the city, at 10:30 a.m.\n\n\"A radio contact was established for the boat, which, according to the owner, was heading towards the harbor,\" the police statement said. Half an hour later \"the submarine suddenly sank and the owner was subsequently rescued on a private motorboat sailing him in port.\"\n\nMadsen \"told us he had technical problems\" when asked to explain why the submarine failed to respond to radio contact earlier in the day, Damgaard said.", "time": "23:44:00"}

been aboard off coast of Denmark\n\nAn amateur submarine maker is in custody in Copenhagen as police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been onboard his vessel before he is alleged to have deliberately sunk it off Denmark's east coast.\n\nPeter Madsen, a Danish inventor whose crowdfunded submarine Nautilus sank near Copenhagen on Friday, was arrested on preliminary manslaughter charges but has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall.\n\nHe claims she disembarked on an island about three-and-a-half hours into their trip on Thursday night, according to Copenhagen police.\n\nPolice spokesman Jens M\u00f8ller Jensen said on Sunday that the submarine had been raised from the sea bed and searched but no body had been discovered. The search for Wall in the water, from the air and on land, continues.\n\nM\u00f8ller Jensen added that there were indications that Madsen deliberately sank his submarine.\n\nOn Saturday, after a two-hour custody hearing held in private, Judge Kari S\u00f8rensen ordered that Madsen be held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while the investigation into Wall's disappearance continued.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faced a preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5pm\".\n\nMadsen's defence lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nWall, a freelance journalist, had been writing about Madsen and his submarine at the time of disappearing, according to Swedish and Danish reports.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said.\n\nShe lives between New York and Beijing, the family said, and has written for titles including the Guardian, New York Times, South China Morning Post and Vice. Her LinkedIn page says she writes about \"identity, gender, pop-culture, social justice, foreign policy and the undercurrents of rebellion\".\n\nMadsen made headlines when he successfully financed the building of the 40-tonne, 18-metre Nautilus through crowdfunding, completing it in 2008.\n\nHe appeared on Danish television on Friday to discuss the submarine's sinking and his rescue. Footage aired on Denmark's TV2 channel showed him getting off what appeared to be a private boat and making a thumbs-up sign as he walked away. \"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down,\" he told TV2.\n\nMadsen said \"a minor problem with a ballast tank ... turned into a major issue\" that ultimately caused the sinking of the vessel, considered to be the largest privately-built submarine of its kind. The ballast tank is a compartment that holds water to provide stability.\n\n\"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close any hatches or anything,\" Madsen said. \"But I guess that was pretty good because I otherwise still would have been down there.\"\n\nSwedish police said later in the day that they were investigating the whereabouts of Wall, who they said had been on the submarine at some point. \"Whether the woman was on board the submarine at the time of her disappearance is unclear,\" police said.\n\nA navy spokesman, Anders Damgaard, said: \"He told us that the journalist who also had been on board had been dropped off on Thursday evening. They were the only two on board yesterday.\"\n\nAuthorities were alerted to issues with the voyage when Wall's boyfriend reported her missing early on Friday. Two helicopters and three ships searched the sea from Copenhagen to the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm.\n\nThe navy initially said the craft was \"found sailing\" south of Copenhagen. But Damgaard later said the 40 tonne submarine had sunk.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the navy's call to help locate the ship, sailed out immediately Friday and saw Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"[He] came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\", before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen \"told us he had technical problems\" to explain why the submarine failed to respond to radio contact, Damgaard said.", "time": "12:53:00"}

It was the journalist's boyfriend who alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned from a test run, police said.\n\n\"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down,\" Madsen told Denmark's TV2 channel, which aired footage of him getting off what appeared to be a private boat and giving a thumbs-up sign.\n\nMadsen said \"a minor problem with a ballast tank\" -- a compartment that holds water to provide stability -- \"turned into a major issue\" that ultimately caused the submarine to sink.\n\n\"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close any hatches or anything,\" he said. \"But I guess that was pretty good, because I otherwise still would have been down there.\"\n\nSwedish police said later in the day they were investigating the whereabouts of a missing woman who had been on the submarine at some point.\n\n\"Whether the woman was on board the submarine at the time of her disappearance is unclear,\" police said in a statement.\n\nThe woman was a journalist writing about Madsen and his submarine, Swedish and Danish media reported.\n\n\"He told us that the journalist who also had been on board had been dropped off Thursday evening,\" Danish navy spokesman Anders Damgaard told The Associated Press. \"They were the only two on board yesterday.\"\n\nCopenhagen Deputy Police Inspector Jens Moller Jensen says investigators are looking for witnesses who may have seen the woman after the time Madsen reported she disembarked. She also was not identified by name.\n\nThe police statement said the submerged submarine was lying in seven feet of water, but divers had not been able to enter it safely as of Friday night. They were hoping to tow it to port on Saturday and open it then, the statement said.\n\nMadsen describes himself as an \"inventrepaneur\" on the website for his Copenhagen-based company. RML Spacelab is seeking to send people into space and is developing a rocket, floating launch pad and astronaut testing machine among other projects, the site says.\n\n\"My passion is finding ways to travel to worlds beyond the well-known,\" Madsen wrote on the site. \"I design and manufacture non-commercial extreme machines, employing teams of volunteering engineers and technicians to challenge the ordinary....\"\n\n\"The undersea world is close, it's beautiful, always just around the corner in Denmark. Diving, no matter the method, is very challenging and it*s technically difficult to go to beyond where rubber suits and scuba gear can take us.\"\n\nThe Nautilus set out from Refshale Island, a former shipyard redeveloped as an entertainment and activity spot, at about 7 p.m. local time on Thursday, according to a police timeline.\n\nTwo helicopters and three ships combed the sea from Copenhagen to the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm after police received the report it had not gotten back to land just after 3:30 a.m. It was spotted by a lighthouse in Koge Bay, a seaport south of the city, at 10:30 a.m.\n\n\"A radio contact was established for the boat, which, according to the owner, was heading towards the harbor,\" the police statement said. Half an hour later \"the submarine suddenly sank and the owner was subsequently rescued on a private motorboat sailing him in port.\"\n\nMadsen \"told us he had technical problems\" when asked to explain why the submarine failed to respond to radio contact earlier in the day, Damgaard said.", "time": "06:55:00"}

an amateur-built submarine was arrested on suspicion of murder Friday after his vessel sank off Denmark's coast and a journalist who had joined him for what was supposed to be a short voyage was reported missing, Copenhagen police said.\n\nPolice said in a statement Friday night that the man denied killing the missing woman and reported dropping her off on a redeveloped island in Copenhagen's harbor about 3 \u00bd hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\nThe statement did not identify the submarine's owner, Peter Madsen, 46, but the Danish inventor's financing of the project through crowdfunding and first launch of the UC3 Nautilus in 2008 made headlines.\n\nThe 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) vessel has been described as the largest privately built submarine of its kind.\n\nBefore his arrest, Madsen appeared on Danish television to discuss the submarine's sinking and his rescue. It was the journalist's boyfriend who alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned from a test run, police said.\n\n\"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down,\" Madsen told Denmark's TV2 channel, which aired footage of him getting off what appeared to be a private boat and giving a thumbs-up sign.\n\nMadsen said \"a minor problem with a ballast tank\" -- a compartment that holds water to provide stability -- \"turned into a major issue\" that ultimately caused the submarine to sink.\n\n\"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close any hatches or anything,\" he said. \"But I guess that was pretty good, because I otherwise still would have been down there.\"\n\nSwedish police said later in the day they were investigating the whereabouts of a missing woman who had been on the submarine at some point.\n\n\"Whether the woman was on board the submarine at the time of her disappearance is unclear,\" police said in a statement.\n\nThe woman was a journalist writing about Madsen and his submarine, Swedish and Danish media reported.\n\n\"He told us that the journalist who also had been on board had been dropped off Thursday evening,\" Danish navy spokesman Anders Damgaard told The Associated Press. \"They were the only two on board yesterday.\"\n\nCopenhagen Deputy Police Inspector Jens Moller Jensen says investigators are looking for witnesses who may have seen the woman after the time Madsen reported she disembarked. She also was not identified by name.\n\nThe police statement said the submerged submarine was lying in seven feet of water, but divers had not been able to enter it safely as of Friday night. They were hoping to tow it to port on Saturday and open it then, the statement said.\n\nMadsen describes himself as an \"inventrepaneur\" on the website for his Copenhagen-based company. RML Spacelab is seeking to send people into space and is developing a rocket, floating launch pad and astronaut testing machine among other projects, the site says.\n\n\"My passion is finding ways to travel to worlds beyond the well-known,\" Madsen wrote on the site. \"I design and manufacture non-commercial extreme machines, employing teams of volunteering engineers and technicians to challenge the ordinary....\"\n\n\"The undersea world is close, it's beautiful, always just around the corner in Denmark. Diving, no matter the method, is very challenging and it*s technically difficult to go to beyond where rubber suits and scuba gear can take us.\"\n\nThe Nautilus set out from Refshale Island, a former shipyard redeveloped as an entertainment and activity spot, at about 7 p.m. local time on Thursday, according to a police timeline.\n\nTwo helicopters and three ships combed the sea from Copenhagen to the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm after police received the report it had not gotten back to land just after 3:30 a.m. It was spotted by a lighthouse in Koge Bay, a seaport south of the city, at 10:30 a.m.\n\n\"A radio contact was established for the boat, which, according to the owner, was heading towards the harbor,\" the police statement said. Half an hour later \"the submarine suddenly sank and the owner was subsequently rescued on a private motorboat sailing him in port.\"\n\nMadsen \"told us he had technical problems\" when asked to explain why the submarine failed to respond to radio contact earlier in the day, Damgaard said.\n\n-- -- --\n\nLisa Leff contributed from London.", "time": "22:39:00"}

(Jacob Ehrbahn/Ritzau Foto via AP)\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- A Danish court ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine Saturday held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nThe inventor, who is from Denmark, has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub, , named the UC3 Nautilus, had not returned to Copenhagen as expected. The Danish Navy launched a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "01:58:00"}

He was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges.\n\nMoller Jensen said there are indications that the Danish inventor deliberately sank the 40-ton, 60-foot-long submarine.\n\nMadsen was ordered held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate Wall's disappearance. The inventor says the journalist disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned to Copenhagen as expected. The Danish Navy launched a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he spotted Madsen standing in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nA salvage vessel on Saturday raised the submarine, which was 22 feet under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up four miles off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 1,550 feet but has rarely gone deeper than 132 feet, according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "08:31:00"}

Danish court has ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine to be held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast. He has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying she had disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling Saturday after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains he is innocent.\n\nHald Engmark says Madsen is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling.\n\nThe family of a journalist who has been missing since she joined the inventor of an amateur-built submarine on a voyage in Denmark says she freelanced for prestigious publications such as the New York Times, The Guardian and Vice Magazine.\n\nKim Wall's family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press on Saturday, \"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark.\"\n\nHer family says the 30-year-old Sweden-born journalist lives in New York and Peking and had studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris and the London School of Economics.\n\nShe also received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in New York in 2013.\n\nThe submarine's Danish inventor, Peter Madsen, is being held on suspicion of manslaughter in Wall's disappearance.\n\nThe submarine sank on Friday, but Madsen says Wall disembarked on Thursday night.\n\nA boater who helped search a private submarine that sank off Denmark says he saw inventor Peter Madsen Kristian standing in the vessel's tower while it was still afloat.\n\nKristian Isbak tells The Associated Press he had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the submarine on Friday when he spotted Madsen.\n\nIsbak says the inventor \"then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink.\"\n\nWhile the UC3 Nautilus was going down, Isbak says \"came up again, stayed in the tower until water came into it as the submarine started sinking.\"\n\nIsbak says he then saw Madsen swim over to another private boat.\n\nMadsen's actions are being scrutinized because he is being detained in the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been onboard his submarine Thursday night.\n\nMadsen says he dropped her off before the sinking.\n\nA judge is set to decide if the owner of an amateur-built submarine should be held in custody during an investigation into whether he is responsible for the disappearance of a Swedish woman who had been onboard his submarine that sank off Denmark's east coast.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) UC3 Nautilus sank. He has denied responsibility for the 30-year-old woman's fate, saying she disembarked earlier.\n\nThe woman's boyfriend alerted authorities that the sub had not returned, prompting a major maritime search. The Navy said it was spotted sailing but then sank.\n\nMadsen told authorities he dropped the woman off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.", "time": "16:11:00"}

Denmark) -- A Danish court ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine Saturday to be held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nHe has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel, named the UC3 Nautilus, went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned to Copenhagen as expected, prompting a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel, the Vina, on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "13:58:00"}

private submarine that sank off Denmark: (all times local):\n\n5 p.m.\n\nA Danish court has ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine to be held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast. He has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying she had disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling Saturday after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains he is innocent.\n\nHald Engmark says Madsen is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling.\n\n-- -- --\n\n3 p.m.\n\nThe family of a journalist who has been missing since she joined the inventor of an amateur-built submarine on a voyage in Denmark says she freelanced for prestigious publications such as the New York Times, The Guardian and Vice Magazine.\n\nKim Wall's family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press on Saturday, \"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark.\"\n\nHer family says the 30-year-old Sweden-born journalist lives in New York and Peking and had studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris and the London School of Economics.\n\nShe also received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in New York in 2013.\n\nThe submarine's Danish inventor, Peter Madsen, is being held on suspicion of manslaughter in Wall's disappearance.\n\nThe submarine sank on Friday, but Madsen says Wall disembarked on Thursday night.\n\n-- -- --\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nA boater who helped search a private submarine that sank off Denmark says he saw inventor Peter Madsen Kristian standing in the vessel's tower while it was still afloat.\n\nKristian Isbak tells The Associated Press he had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the submarine on Friday when he spotted Madsen.\n\nIsbak says the inventor \"then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink.\"\n\nGet news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

He has denied responsibility for the 30-year-old woman's fate, saying she disembarked earlier.\n\nThe woman's boyfriend alerted authorities that the sub had not returned, prompting a major maritime search.

deliberately\n\nThe body of a missing Swedish journalist is not on board a crowdfunded submarine that sank off the Danish coast on Friday, police have revealed.\n\nOfficers had been hoping to find the remains of 30-year-old Kim Wall on board the wreckage of the UC3 Nautilus submarine which was wrecked in Copenhagen harbour on Friday.\n\nMiss Wall was last seen on board the vessel with amateur builder Peter Madsen who is now being held on suspicion of negligent manslaughter.\n\nDanish investigators say they have found evidence the Nautilus was sunk deliberately as they continue land and sea searches for any sign of Miss Wall, Swedish newspaper Expressen reports.\n\nThe body of missing journalist Kim Wall, 30, is not on board a submarine that sank in Copenhagen harbour after she was last seen on board, police say\n\nPeter Madsen, who built the submarine himself before inviting Miss Wall along for the maiden voyage, is still under investigation for negligent manslaughter as investigators say there is evidence it was wrecked deliberately\n\nThe UC3 Nautilus was raised from the bottom of Copenhagen harbour on Saturday night where it had been under 8m (24ft) of water since sinking on Friday morning\n\nThe freelance reporter boarded the sub, which was built by Madsen, on Thursday night in order to write a story about it.\n\nOn Friday morning the Danish Navy were scrambled to help the stricken sub, before reporting it sunk at 10.45am.\n\nMadsen claims he was the only one on board at the time, and that he dropped Miss Wall off at the mouth of the harbour shortly after 10pm the previous night.\n\nBut Danish police on Sunday said he has given them several conflicting accounts of what had happened, without elaborating further.\n\nMiss Wall's family and boyfriend have not heard from her since she boarded the submarine and police have been unable to contact her.\n\nAround the time he claimed to have dropped Miss Wall off, Madsen sent a mysterious text to a friend saying she had left the vessel and cancelling a trip he was supposed to be taking on the submarine the following day, according to local reports.\n\nHe did not respond to questions from the friend about why he had dropped Miss Wall off or why the trip was being cancelled.\n\nMadsen was arrested on manslaughter charges on Saturday before a judge ordered that he be held in custody while investigations are carried out.\n\nDespite not finding Miss Wall's body, Danish investigators are continuing to search in water and on land for any sign of her\n\nMadsen claims he dropped Miss Wall off at the mouth of the harbour and was the only one on board when his craft (pictured right) sank\n\nMiss Wall's family have not heard from her and police say they have been unable to contact her since she boarded the submarine (pictured overnight Saturday) on Thursday\n\nSpeaking to reporters at court, Madsen said 'there is something I really want to tell you later', without elaborating any further.\n\nThe prosecutor asked for doors to the hearing to be closed as information likely to distress Miss Wall's family was about to be heard.\n\nThe 40-ton, 18-meter long Nautilus, one of three subs built by Madsen, was found by divers under 7m (24ft) of water, though they were unable to enter it safely.\n\nA salvage ship, the Vina, has now raised the sub from the sea bed close to Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer and brought it back to shore to be inspected.\n\nAuthorities were alerted that something had gone wrong with the submarine by Miss Wall's boyfriend after she failed to return home, prompting a major search operation involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship, sailed out immediately Friday and saw Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\nDivers had located the submarine underwater on Friday but were unable to enter it safely\n\nThe submarine was reported missing early on Friday by Miss Wall's boyfriend after she failed to return home, prompting a major search operation by the Danish Navy\n\n'He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,' Isbak told The Associated Press.\n\n'(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it' before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen said there was a valve error that became serious when he tried to repair it.\n\nFootage aired on Denmark's TV2 channel showed Madsen, 46, getting off what seemed to be a private boat and making a thumbs up sign as he walked away.\n\nUpon his rescue from K\u00f8ge Bay, Madsen said: 'I'm fine. But I'm sorry because 'Nautilus' has gone down.'\n\nMiss Wall is a freelance journalist who graduated with a masters from Columbia University before going on to write about identity, gender, pop-culture, social justice and foreign policy.\n\nMadsen, pictured above in 2008 in front of his submarine, was seen standing the tower of the still-floating submarine moments before it sank, according to a rescuer\n\nMadsen claimed his creation had suffered a valve failure that became much worse when he tried to fix it, leading to the sinking\n\nShe is from Sweden but spent time living in New York and Beijing. Her writing has appeared in Harpers, The Guardian, New York Times, Foreign Policy, Vice Magazine, Slate, South China Morning Post, The Atlantic, Roads & Kingdoms, and TIME.\n\nThe submarine was Madsen's third attempt at building such a structure and was the largest privately built submarine in the world at the time of its launch.\n\nThe Nautilus was a diesel-electric submarine.

A Danish court ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine Saturday held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nThe inventor, who is from Denmark, has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defence lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to co-operate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub, , named the UC3 Nautilus, had not returned to Copenhagen as expected. The Danish Navy launched a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbour a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 metres (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 metres (132 feet), according to Madsen's business website.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "22:14:00"}

He declined to give details.\n\nMadsen later said there was a valve error that became serious when he tried to repair it.\n\nFootage aired on Denmark's TV2 channel showed Madsen, 46, getting off what seemed to be a private boat and making a thumbs up sign as he walked away.\n\nUpon his rescue from K\u00f8ge Bay, Madsen said: 'I'm fine. But I'm sorry because \"Nautilus\" has gone down.'\n\n'He told us that the journalist who also had been on board had been dropped off Thursday evening,' Damgaard told The Associated Press.\n\nSwedish media said the reporter was Swedish. 'They were the only two on board yesterday'.\n\nAfter the submarine was reported missing early Friday, the navy had launched a search from Copenhagen to the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm with two helicopters and three ships, and encouraged members of the public with boats and sonar to search, too\n\n'He told us he had technical problems' to explain why the submarine failed to respond to radio contact, Damgaard said.\n\nThe submarine was Madsen's third attempt at building such a structure and was the largest privately built submarine in the world at the time of its launch.\n\nThe Nautilus is a diesel-electric submarine.

submarine shortly before it was wrecked.\n\nMiss Wall, 30, has not been seen since the ill-fated voyage, though Madsen claims he dropped her off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor not long into the voyage.\n\nPeter Madsen, 46, whose home-built submarine sank near Copenhagen on Friday, is now being investigated over the disappearance of journalist Kim Wall, 30, who was on board with him\n\nMadsen (pictured right after he was rescued from the sinking craft) claims he dropped Miss Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbour before his vessel sank\n\nThe UC3 Nautilus was built by Madsen who crowd-funded \u00a3154,000 to create the 40-ton, 18m vessel which he claimed could reach a depth of 1,150ft\n\nPolice in Sweden said they have tried without success to contact Miss Wall by phone. Her family has not heard from her.\n\nHe is currently being held on preliminary manslaughter charges with a judge set to rule on Saturday whether he must remain in detention while investigations are carried out.\n\nThe 40-ton, 18-meter long Nautilus, one of three subs built by Madsen, is currently sitting under 7m (24ft) of water with divers unable to enter it safely.\n\nA salvage ship, the Vina, is working to raise the vessel which came to rest on the sea bed close to Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer.\n\nAuthorities were alerted that something had gone wrong with the submarine by Miss Wall's boyfriend after she failed to return home, prompting a major search operation involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship, sailed out immediately Friday and saw Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n'He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,' Isbak told The Associated Press.\n\nThe submarine was reported missing early on Friday by Miss Wall's boyfriend after she failed to return home, prompting a major search operation by the Danish Navy\n\nMadsen, pictured above in 2008 in front of his submarine, was seen standing the tower of the still-floating submarine moments before it sank, according to a rescuer\n\nMadsen claimed his creation had suffered a valve failure that became much worse when he tried to fix it, leading to the sinking\n\n'(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it' before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen said there was a valve error that became serious when he tried to repair it.\n\nFootage aired on Denmark's TV2 channel showed Madsen, 46, getting off what seemed to be a private boat and making a thumbs up sign as he walked away.\n\nUpon his rescue from K\u00f8ge Bay, Madsen said: 'I'm fine. But I'm sorry because 'Nautilus' has gone down.'\n\nMiss Wall is a freelance journalist who graduated with a masters from Columbia University before going on to write about identity, gender, pop-culture, social justice and foreign policy.\n\nShe is from Sweden but spent time living in New York and Beijing. Her writing has appeared in Harpers, The Guardian, New York Times, Foreign Policy, Vice Magazine, Slate, South China Morning Post, The Atlantic, Roads & Kingdoms, and TIME.\n\nThe submarine was Madsen's third attempt at building such a structure and was the largest privately built submarine in the world at the time of its launch.\n\nThe Nautilus was a diesel-electric submarine. The diesel engine is uses when sailing or propelling just below the surface, while the electrical engine is used when the submarine is deep below the water's surface.\n\nIt was built like a post-World War II submarine, with a galley, crew bunks, officer's mass, bridge and engine room.\n\nIt's named after the famed submarine manned by Jules Verne's Captain Nemo character in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.", "time": "11:06:00"}

He is \"willing to co-operate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub, , named the UC3 Nautilus, had not returned to Copenhagen as expected.

The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 metres (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 metres (132 feet), according to Madsen's business website.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "22:11:00"}

"body": "COPENHAGEN - A Danish court ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine Saturday held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nThe inventor, who is from Denmark, has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defence lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to co-operate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub, , named the UC3 Nautilus, had not returned to Copenhagen as expected. The Danish Navy launched a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbour a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 metres (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 metres (132 feet), according to Madsen's business website.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "21:47:00"}

He previously said he dropped her off on one of Copenhagen's harbor islands.\n\nMedia frenzy surrounding the case forced the hearing to be moved to a larger courtroom in Copenhagen on Saturday.\n\n\"I would like to have my say,\" Madsen, 46, told reporters and the public at the courtroom after the prosecutor said he faced \"preliminary charges [of manslaughter] for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden.\"\n\nThe judge insisted, however, that initial statements should be given behind closed doors. After the hearing, Madsen, who has been a suspect since Friday, was placed in detention for 24 days.\n\nFriends, relatives and colleagues of Wall, who had been educated at Columbia University, Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, and worked as a freelance journalist, have bombarded social media with requests for information about her. Her family has also released a statement saying they still hoped that she would be found \"safe and well.\" Wall has not been reachable by phone since shortly after boarding Madsen's UC3 Nautilus submarine as part of an assignment for \"Wired\" magazine on Thursday evening.\n\nOn Saturday, the rescue vessel Vina recovered the UC3 Nautilus submarine, which is being treated as a possible crime scene, from the bottom of the sea near the island of Dragoer south of Copenhagen. The 18-meter-long, 40-ton vessel, built in 2008 with help from crowdfunding, was at the time the biggest private submarine in the world, and made its designer and captain a national celebrity.\n\nThe disappearance of Wall, whose articles have been published by the New York Times, the Guardian and other high-profile publications, was first reported by her boyfriend, who called the police after she failed to return on Thursday night.\n\nUnable to contact the Nautilus, police began a rescue operation involving two helicopters, three ships, and multiple volunteer vessels.\n\nKristian Isbak, who runs a marine company, says that he saw the moment the Nautilus sank on Friday morning.\n\nIsbak responded to the Navy's call to help locate the missing submarine, noticed the vessel on the sonar, and then spotted its sail above the water.\n\n\"We realized that it was Peter Madsen's submarine. A man sat in the tower, he climbed down and then up into the tower again,\" he told Danish daily Ekstra Bladet. \"There was a powerful pressure wave around the submarine. It began to sink. Madsen stood quite calmly in the tower. When the submarine had sunk so much that he could swim, it only took 10-15 seconds, Madsen leaped into the water and paddled to a rescue boat.\"\n\nMadsen gave a thumbs-up to gathered reporters when he came ashore, though admitted to local broadcaster TV2 that he was \"sad\" to have lost the Nautilus.\n\nWhen asked about the whereabouts of Wall, he claimed that he dropped her off near a restaurant on Refshaleon Island in Copenhagen harbor on Thursday evening, and then gave his own account of the sinking.\n\n\"I was out on a rehearsal trip, tinkering with different things in the submarine. Then a defect happened with a ballast tank which wasn't that serious, until I tried to repair it.

Its owner, Peter Madsen, was later rescued and claimed he'd had technical difficulties. Copenhagen police now say that they have charged Madsen with killing a Swedish woman who was last seen with him on board the submarine.\n\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons\n\nWhen the UC3 Nautilus was first launched in 2008, it was touted as the world's largest privately built submarine. It's had some trouble along the way but was back in action this year. On Friday, however, it sunk off the coast of Denmark.\n\nThe Associated Press reported yesterday that Peter Madsen, the owner of the vessel and co-founder of Copenhagen Suborbitals, was returned to shore by a private boat after a technical malfunction sank the sub. \"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down,\" Madsen told Denmark's TV2, \"a minor problem with a ballast tank... turned into a major issue.\"\n\nFurther details are sketchy. According to the report, \"The navy initially said the sub was 'found sailing' south of Copenhagen.\" But later corrected themselves and confirmed that it had sunk. Soon thereafter, Copenhagen police confirmed that an unidentified woman had been reported missing and her boyfriend told authorities that she had been on the submarine doing a story for Wired. A spokesperson for Wired's US division tells Gizmodo that the reporter was not working for them and they are trying to confirm if she was working for the UK division. The boyfriend is said to be the one who first alerted police that the submarine was missing when it didn't return on time.\n\nAccording to Danish outlet Berlingske, a spokesperson for the Danish police said that Madsen claims he dropped the woman off in Copenhagen the previous night. \"We know she was aboard the submarine last night, but we do not know if she was aboard the boat when she disappeared,\" the spokesperson said. \"All I can say is that the woman's relatives reported her missing this night and that we still have not heard from her.\" Local police tweeted that they were investigating and had no further comment at the time.\n\nHowever, according to a press release since released from Copenhagen police, Madsen has now been arrested and charged with \"killing\" the Swedish woman. He denies the charges and still claims he dropped the still unidentified woman off in Copenhagen on Thursday night around 11:30PM local time. Police are seeking any witnesses who may have seen the woman after 4PM on Thursday.\n\nThe police description of the missing woman reads:\n\n160 cm tall, 56 kg, 30 years, faint of building, reddish brown hair, green eyes. Wearing an orange blouse with long sleeves, black and white floral skirt, nylon stockings and white tennis shoes.\n\n\"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close any hatches or anything,\" Madsen told reporters. Co-founder of the DIY rocket ship group Copenhagen Suborbitals, Madsen is a an eccentric renaissance man who helped build the UC3 Nautilus with a group of volunteers over the course of three years. It was launched in May of 2008 and performed relatively smoothly for several years before being grounded in 2011. Repairs and maintainance were needed and following a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, it relaunched in April this year.\n\nCopenhagen Suborbitals is a group of amateur rocket enthusiasts that supports itself through crowdfunding and has around 55 volunteers. The collective hopes to one day fly a volunteer on one of its rockets, but flight tests have, so far, failed. The Nautilus was another project for the group and was a bigger success. In 2014, Madsen left the group to focus on other projects, one of which being the UC3 Nautilus.\n\nThe UC3 Nautilus submarine association was formed in order to separate ownership of the sub from Copenhagen Suborbitals. But within a year, Madsen was feuding with the board of that organisation over who the proper owner of Nautilus really was. A statement on the association's website claims that board members received a text message from Madsen that read in part, \"You may think that a curse is lying on Nautilus. That curse is me.\" After several rounds of negotiation, the board decided to cede ownership of the vessel to Madsen.\n\nThe submarine's tumultuous journey is now at an end. But many questions remain unanswered. First and foremost, authorities are scrambling to find the missing journalist that was last seen with Madsen. Police divers reportedly searched the area for the UC3 Nautilus wreckage, while the Danish navy also encouraged members of the public who have the right equipment to help with the search. Police say that the submarine was found by divers but will need to be hauled to shore before they can enter. It was found on the seabed in Koge Bay, 7m below the surface.\n\n[Associated Press]\n\nWATCH MORE: Science & Health News", "time": "21:27:00"}

The vessel's 46-year-old inventor Peter Madsen has been accused of negligent manslaughter and was remanded in custody for 24 days.\n\nHe has denied the allegations.\n\nThe vessel, the Nautilus, was refloated and towed to the Copenhagen port yesterday, then emptied of water overnight. Today police entered the sub and found it empty.\n\nPolice have identified the missing journalist as Kim Wall, a 30-year-old Swedish woman who was writing a feature about Madsen.\n\nNothing has been heard from her since Thursday evening when she boarded the sub with Madsen.\n\nHer boyfriend alerted police early on Friday that she had not returned home as planned.\n\nMadsen claims he dropped her off on the Refshaleoen island on Thursday evening after the interview.\n\nEarly on Friday, Danish authorities announced they were looking for the Nautilus in waters off Copenhagen.\n\nAround midday on Friday, the vessel was located in a bay in Koge, some 50 kilometres south of the Danish capital. Just after being located, Madsen was rescued and the submarine suddenly sank.\n\nMadsen said in media interviews after his rescue that the sub encountered a problem with the ballast tank.\n\nHowever, Moller said it appeared as though the sub was intentionally sunk, amid media speculation that Madsen may have downed the vessel to cover up a crime.\n\n\"It appears as though it was a deliberate action that caused the sub to sink,\" Moller said.\n\nWall is a freelance journalist based in China and the US. Her articles have appeared in the New York Times and the Guardian, among others.\n\n\"We're still hoping that we'll find Kim Wall alive, but we are preparing ourselves for the fact that she may not be,\" Moller said.\n\nMadsen made headlines when he launched the 18-metre Nautilus in 2008, at the time the world's biggest homemade submarine.\n\n\u00a9 - AFP 2017\n\nRead: Donald Trump's childhood home is up on Airbnb for \u20ac636-a-night", "time": "13:06:00"}

journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 60-foot-long submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nThe inventor, who is from Denmark, has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub, , named the UC3 Nautilus, had not returned to Copenhagen as expected. The Danish Navy launched a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel on Saturday raised the submarine, which was 23 feet under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 4.3 miles off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 1,550 feet but has rarely gone deeper than 132 feet, according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "20:32:00"}

submarine that sank off Denmark: (all times local):\n\n5 p.m.\n\nA Danish court has ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine to be held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast. He has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying she had disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling Saturday after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defence lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains he is innocent.\n\nHald Engmark says Madsen is \"willing to co-operate \" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling.\n\n___\n\n3 p.m.\n\nThe family of a journalist who has been missing since she joined the inventor of an amateur-built submarine on a voyage in Denmark says she freelanced for prestigious publications such as the New York Times, The Guardian and Vice Magazine.\n\nKim Wall's family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press on Saturday, \"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark.\"\n\nHer family says the 30-year-old Sweden-born journalist lives in New York and Peking and had studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris and the London School of Economics.\n\nShe also received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in New York in 2013.\n\nThe submarine's Danish inventor, Peter Madsen, is being held on suspicion of manslaughter in Wall's disappearance.\n\nThe submarine sank on Friday, but Madsen says Wall disembarked on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nA boater who helped search a private submarine that sank off Denmark says he saw inventor Peter Madsen Kristian standing in the vessel's tower while it was still afloat.\n\nKristian Isbak tells The Associated Press he had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the submarine on Friday when he spotted Madsen.\n\nIsbak says the inventor \"then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink.\"\n\nWhile the UC3 Nautilus was going down, Isbak says \"came up again, stayed in the tower until water came into it as the submarine started sinking.\"\n\nIsbak says he then saw Madsen swim over to another private boat.\n\nMadsen's actions are being scrutinized because he is being detained in the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been onboard his submarine Thursday night.\n\nMadsen says he dropped her off before the sinking.\n\n___\n\n10:55 a.m.\n\nA judge is set to decide if the owner of an amateur-built submarine should be held in custody during an investigation into whether he is responsible for the disappearance of a Swedish woman who had been onboard his submarine that sank off Denmark's east coast.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) UC3 Nautilus sank. He has denied responsibility for the 30-year-old woman's fate, saying she disembarked earlier.\n\nThe woman's boyfriend alerted authorities that the sub had not returned, prompting a major maritime search. The Navy said it was spotted sailing but then sank.\n\nMadsen told authorities he dropped the woman off on an island in Copenhagen's harbour a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\nThe hearing starts at 1200 GMT.", "time": "15:31:00"}

He previously said he dropped her off on one of Copenhagen's harbor islands.\n\nMedia frenzy surrounding the case forced the hearing to be moved to a larger courtroom in Copenhagen on Saturday.\n\n\"I would like to have my say,\" Madsen, 46, told reporters and the public at the courtroom after the prosecutor said he faced \"preliminary charges [of manslaughter] for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden.\"\n\nThe judge insisted, however, that initial statements should be given behind closed doors. After the hearing, Madsen, who has been a suspect since Friday, was placed in detention for 24 days.\n\nFriends, relatives and colleagues of Wall, who had been educated at Columbia University, Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, and worked as a freelance journalist, have bombarded social media with requests for information about her. Her family has also released a statement saying they still hoped that she would be found \"safe and well.\" Wall has not been reachable by phone since shortly after boarding Madsen's UC3 Nautilus submarine as part of an assignment for \"Wired\" magazine on Thursday evening.\n\nOn Saturday, the rescue vessel Vina recovered the UC3 Nautilus submarine, which is being treated as a possible crime scene, from the bottom of the sea near the island of Dragoer south of Copenhagen. The 18-meter-long, 40-ton vessel, built in 2008 with help from crowdfunding, was at the time the biggest private submarine in the world, and made its designer and captain a national celebrity.\n\nThe disappearance of Wall, whose articles have been published by the New York Times, the Guardian and other high-profile publications, was first reported by her boyfriend, who called the police after she failed to return on Thursday night.\n\nUnable to contact the Nautilus, police began a rescue operation involving two helicopters, three ships, and multiple volunteer vessels.\n\nKristian Isbak, who runs a marine company, says that he saw the moment the Nautilus sank on Friday morning.\n\nIsbak responded to the Navy's call to help locate the missing submarine, noticed the vessel on the sonar, and then spotted its sail above the water.\n\n\"We realized that it was Peter Madsen's submarine. A man sat in the tower, he climbed down and then up into the tower again,\" he told Danish daily Ekstra Bladet. \"There was a powerful pressure wave around the submarine. It began to sink. Madsen stood quite calmly in the tower. When the submarine had sunk so much that he could swim, it only took 10-15 seconds, Madsen leaped into the water and paddled to a rescue boat.\"\n\nMadsen gave a thumbs-up to gathered reporters when he came ashore, though admitted to local broadcaster TV2 that he was \"sad\" to have lost the Nautilus.\n\nWhen asked about the whereabouts of Wall, he claimed that he dropped her off near a restaurant on Refshaleon Island in Copenhagen harbor on Thursday evening, and then gave his own account of the sinking.\n\n\"I was out on a rehearsal trip, tinkering with different things in the submarine. Then a defect happened with a ballast tank which wasn't that serious, until I tried to repair it. Then it suddenly became very serious,\" Madsen told TV2. \"After that, it took 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink. I couldn't close the catch or anything. But that might be OK, as I would still be down there then.\"\n\nDanish daily Ekstra Bladet reported police sources as claiming that Madsen was suspected of intentionally sinking the vessel to cover up his tracks.", "time": "16:58:00"}

held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast. He has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying she had disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling Saturday after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains he is innocent.\n\nHald Engmark says Madsen is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling.\n\nThe family of a journalist who has been missing since she joined the inventor of an amateur-built submarine on a voyage in Denmark says she freelanced for prestigious publications such as the New York Times, The Guardian and Vice Magazine.\n\nKim Wall's family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press on Saturday, \"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark.\"\n\nHer family says the 30-year-old Sweden-born journalist lives in New York and Peking and had studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris and the London School of Economics.\n\nShe also received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in New York in 2013.\n\nThe submarine's Danish inventor, Peter Madsen, is being held on suspicion of manslaughter in Wall's disappearance.\n\nThe submarine sank on Friday, but Madsen says Wall disembarked on Thursday night.\n\nA boater who helped search a private submarine that sank off Denmark says he saw inventor Peter Madsen Kristian standing in the vessel's tower while it was still afloat.\n\nKristian Isbak tells The Associated Press he had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the submarine on Friday when he spotted Madsen.\n\nIsbak says the inventor \"then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink.\"\n\nWhile the UC3 Nautilus was going down, Isbak says \"came up again, stayed in the tower until water came into it as the submarine started sinking.\"\n\nIsbak says he then saw Madsen swim over to another private boat.\n\nMadsen's actions are being scrutinized because he is being detained in the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been onboard his submarine Thursday night.\n\nMadsen says he dropped her off before the sinking.\n\nA judge is set to decide if the owner of an amateur-built submarine should be held in custody during an investigation into whether he is responsible for the disappearance of a Swedish woman who had been onboard his submarine that sank off Denmark's east coast.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) UC3 Nautilus sank. He has denied responsibility for the 30-year-old woman's fate, saying she disembarked earlier.\n\nThe woman's boyfriend alerted authorities that the sub had not returned, prompting a major maritime search. The Navy said it was spotted sailing but then sank.\n\nMadsen told authorities he dropped the woman off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\nThe hearing starts at 1200 GMT.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

-- A Danish court ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine Saturday held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nThe inventor, who is from Denmark, has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub, , named the UC3 Nautilus, had not returned to Copenhagen as expected. The Danish Navy launched a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast. He has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying she had disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling Saturday after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains he is innocent.\n\nHald Engmark says Madsen is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling.\n\nThe family of a journalist who has been missing since she joined the inventor of an amateur-built submarine on a voyage in Denmark says she freelanced for prestigious publications such as the New York Times, The Guardian and Vice Magazine.\n\nDefense restoration fund might be a bargaining chip in budget talks\n\nKim Wall's family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press on Saturday, \"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark.\"\n\nHer family says the 30-year-old Sweden-born journalist lives in New York and Peking and had studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris and the London School of Economics.\n\nShe also received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in New York in 2013.\n\nThe submarine's Danish inventor, Peter Madsen, is being held on suspicion of manslaughter in Wall's disappearance.\n\nThe submarine sank on Friday, but Madsen says Wall disembarked on Thursday night.\n\nA boater who helped search a private submarine that sank off Denmark says he saw inventor Peter Madsen Kristian standing in the vessel's tower while it was still afloat.\n\nKristian Isbak tells The Associated Press he had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the submarine on Friday when he spotted Madsen.\n\nIsbak says the inventor \"then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink.\"\n\nWhile the UC3 Nautilus was going down, Isbak says \"came up again, stayed in the tower until water came into it as the submarine started sinking.\"\n\nIsbak says he then saw Madsen swim over to another private boat.\n\nMadsen's actions are being scrutinized because he is being detained in the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been onboard his submarine Thursday night.\n\nMadsen says he dropped her off before the sinking.\n\nA judge is set to decide if the owner of an amateur-built submarine should be held in custody during an investigation into whether he is responsible for the disappearance of a Swedish woman who had been onboard his submarine that sank off Denmark's east coast.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) UC3 Nautilus sank. He has denied responsibility for the 30-year-old woman's fate, saying she disembarked earlier.\n\nThe woman's boyfriend alerted authorities that the sub had not returned, prompting a major maritime search. The Navy said it was spotted sailing but then sank.\n\nMadsen told authorities he dropped the woman off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.", "time": "15:37:00"}

preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nThe inventor, who is from Denmark, has denied

behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub, , named the UC3 Nautilus, had not returned to Copenhagen as expected. The Danish Navy launched a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "03:20:00"}

Danish court ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine Saturday held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nThe inventor, who is from Denmark, has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub, , named the UC3 Nautilus, had not returned to Copenhagen as expected. The Danish Navy launched a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off

court ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine Saturday held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nThe inventor, who is from Denmark, has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub, , named the UC3 Nautilus, had not returned to Copenhagen as expected. The Danish Navy launched a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "19:18:00"}

Kim Wall, saying she had disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nNautilus, named after the ship from the classic science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, was built by Mr Madsen after raising $200,000 (\u00a3154,000) online.\n\nAccording to a statement Wall's family shared with CPJ today, the 30-year-old Swedish-born journalist, who was based in NY and Beijing, was working on a story about inventor Peter Madsen when she went missing.\n\nThe family of a journalist who has been missing since she joined the inventor of an amateur-built submarine on a voyage in Denmark says she freelanced for prestigious publications such as the New York Times, The Guardian and Vice Magazine.\n\nIn a statement to Swedish paper Aftonbladet, Ms Wall's family said: \"It is with great dismay we received the message that Kim is missing\".\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in NY, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe also received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in NY in 2013.\n\nCopenhagen Police confirmed the charges on Friday evening, but its divers have been unable to enter the submarine thus far.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink\", Isbak said.\n\nMadsen had wanted to launch himself into the space race before building his submarine the Nautilus, the biggest privately-made one ever when he made it in 2008.\n\nIts owner Madsen was rescued shortly before, but there was no sign of the Swedish journalist.\n\nMadsen says he dropped her off before the sinking.\n\nCopenhagen police have appealed for anyone who may have seen Ms Wall to contact them. The court decision follows Madsen's arrest yesterday on preliminary murder charges.\n\nThey described her as \"160cm tall, 56kg, 30 years old, with reddish-brown hair and green eyes\".\n\nIt was the journalist's boyfriend who alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned from a test run, police said. Half an hour later \"the submarine suddenly sank and the owner was subsequently rescued on a private motorboat sailing him in port\".\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped the woman off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.", "time": "21:42:00"}

charges over the disappearance of 30-year-old Kim Wall after his 40-tonne, 60ft-long submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nMadsen has denied responsibility for the fate of Ms Wall, saying she had disembarked before his vessel went down.\n\nBut a Danish court ordered that he was detained for 24 days while police investigate her disappearance.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defence lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains he is innocent.\n\nMs Hald Engmark said Madsen is \"willing to cooperate\" and has not decided whether to appeal the detention ruling.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall, of Sweden, sometime after Thursday, 5pm.\"\n\nMs Wall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned to Copenhagen as expected, prompting a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats.\n\nThe Navy said the sub, the UC3 Nautilus, was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterwards.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, said he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Mr Isbak said.\n\n\"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\", before

great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had

in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nHe has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel, named the UC3 Nautilus, went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned to Copenhagen as expected, prompting a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel, the Vina, on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "17:13:00"}

disappearance of a Swedish journalist who was with him on his vessel before it mysteriously sank near Copenhagen.\n\nPeter Madsen, a 46-year-old entrepreneur, had invited Kim Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist, to join him on what was supposed to be a short voyage aboard his private submarine Nautilus.\n\nWhen the submarine did not return as scheduled on Friday morning, Miss Wall's boyfriend raised the alarm and a major naval search was launched to find the vessel.\n\nRescuers found Mr Madsen standing in the tower of the sunken Nautilus but there was no sign of Miss Wall.\n\nThe inventor said he had dropped her on an island in Copenhagen's harbour on Thursday evening but her family said she had disappeared.\n\nDanish police later arrested Mr Madsen on suspicion of her death.\n\nHe appeared in court on Saturday, where prosecutors accused him of killing Miss Wall \"in an unknown way and in an unknown place\" sometime after 5pm on Thursday.\n\nMr Madsen denies the charges and smiled in the courtroom as he talked with his defence lawyer.\n\nNautilus, believed to be the world's largest privately owned submarine, is lying in shallow waters of Denmark's east coast but police divers have not yet been able to enter it.\n\nDanish police suspect that Mr Madsen may have deliberately sank the Nautilus to conceal evidence of Miss Wall's death, according to Ekstra

between New York and Beijing and had written for the New York Times, Time Magazine and the Guardian.\n\nMr Madsen appeared calm during an interview with Danish television shortly after the submarine sank, saying: \"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down.\"\n\nHe said there had been a problem with a ballast tank that \"turned into a major issue\".\n\nNautilus, named after the ship from the classic science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, was built by Mr Madsen after raising $200,000 (\u00a3154,000) online.", "time": "23:40:00"}

an amateur-built submarine Saturday to be held in pretrial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the craft before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 60-foot-long submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel, named the UC3 Nautilus, went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is ''willing to cooperate'' and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n''I would very much like to express myself,'' he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge ''for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabel Fredrika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.''\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned to Copenhagen as expected, prompting a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told the Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n''He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,'' Isbak said. ''[He] came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it'' before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n''It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing,'' her family said.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post, and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel, the Vina, on Saturday raised the submarine, which was 23 feet under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 4.3 miles off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.", "time": "19:51:00"}

inventor has been charged over the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who was with him on his vessel before it mysteriously sank near Copenhagen.\n\nPeter Madsen, a 46-year-old entrepreneur, had invited Kim Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist, to join him on what was supposed to be a short voyage aboard his private submarine Nautilus.\n\nWhen the submarine did not return as scheduled on Friday morning, Miss Wall's boyfriend raised the alarm and a major naval search was launched to find the vessel.\n\nRescuers found Mr Madsen standing in the tower of the sunken Nautilus but there was no sign of Miss Wall.\n\nThe inventor said he had dropped her on an island in Copenhagen's harbour on Thursday evening but her family said she had disappeared.\n\nDanish police later arrested Mr Madsen on suspicion of her death.\n\nHe appeared in court on Saturday, where prosecutors accused him of killing Miss Wall \"in an unknown way and in an unknown place\" sometime after 5pm on Thursday.\n\nMr Madsen denies the charges and smiled in the courtroom as he talked with his defence lawyer.\n\nNautilus, believed to be the world's largest privately owned submarine, is lying in shallow waters of Denmark's east coast but police divers have not yet been able to enter it.\n\nDanish police suspect that Mr Madsen may have deliberately sank the Nautilus to conceal evidence of Miss Wall's death, according to Ekstra Bladet, a Danish newspaper\n\nThe journalist was born in Sweden and studied at the London School of Economics, Columbia University in New York and the Sorbonne in Paris.\n\nShe divided her time between New York and Beijing and had written for the New York Times, Time Magazine and the Guardian.\n\nMr Madsen appeared calm during an interview with Danish television shortly after the submarine sank, saying: \"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down.\"\n\nHe said there had been a problem with a ballast tank that \"turned into a major issue\".\n\nNautilus, named after the ship from the classic science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, was built by Mr Madsen after raising $200,000 (\u00a3154,000) online.", "time":

Madsen was rescued by the navy.\n\nMadsen, 46, has been ordered to be held in custody for 24 days, accused of Wall's manslaughter.\n\nThe vessel was recovered on Saturday from Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen, where it had been lying at a depth of seven metres, and taken into harbour. Police searched it late on Saturday and early on Sunday.\n\n\"There are no persons in the submarine, dead or alive,\" Jens Moller, head of Copenhagen Police's homicide unit, said at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nHe said it appeared to have been deliberately scuttled, and was still being treated as a possible crime scene.\n\nMadsen, an entrepreneur, artist, submarine builder and aerospace engineer, went before a judge on Saturday behind closed doors for preliminary questioning. His defence lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, told Reuters he denied the charges.\n\nPolice said on Friday the inventor had told them he dropped Wall off from his submarine in Copenhagen on Thursday night. On Sunday they said they had since been given another explanation by Madsen, but declined to elaborate.\n\nPolice in Sweden said they had tried without success to contact Wall by phone and that her family had not heard from her.\n\nThe submarine, UC3 Nautilus, is one of three constructed by Madsen. It can carry eight people. (Additional reporting by Stine Jacobsen and Anna Ringstrom; Editing by Andrew Roche)", "time": "12:15:00"}

It's had some trouble along the way but was back in action this year. On Friday, however, it sunk off the coast of Denmark and authorities are concerned about a missing woman who had allegedly been on board the vessel reporting a story for Wired.\n\nThe Associated Press reported early this morning that Peter Madsen, the owner of the vessel and co-founder of Copenhagen Suborbitals, was returned to shore by a private boat after a technical malfunction sank the sub. \"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down,\" Madsen told Denmark's TV2, \"a minor problem with a ballast tank ... turned into a major issue.\"\n\nFurther details are sketchy. According to the report, \"The navy initially said the sub was 'found sailing' south of Copenhagen.\" But later corrected themselves and confirmed that it had sunk. Soon thereafter, Copenhagen police confirmed that an unidentified woman had been reported missing and her boyfriend told authorities that she had been on the submarine doing a story for Wired. The boyfriend is said to be the one who first alerted police that the submarine was missing when it didn't return on time.\n\nAccording to Swedish outlet Berlingske, a spokesperson for the Danish police said that Madsen claims he dropped the woman off in Copenhagen the previous night. \"We know she was aboard the submarine last night, but we do not know if she was aboard the boat when she disappeared.\" the spokesperson said. \"All I can say is that the woman's relatives reported her missing this night and that we still have not heard from her.\" Local police have tweeted that they are investigating and have no further comment at this time.\n\n\"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close any hatches or anything,\" Madsen told reporters. Co-founder of the DIY rocket ship group Copenhagen Suborbitals, Madsen is a an eccentric renaissance man who helped build the UC3 Nautilus with a group of volunteers over the course of three years. It was launched in May of 2008 and performed relatively smoothly for several years before being grounded in 2011. Repairs and maintainance were needed and following a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, it relaunched in April this year.\n\nCopenhagen Suborbitals is a group of amateur rocket enthusiasts that supports itself through crowdfunding and has around 55 volunteers. The collective hopes to one day fly a volunteer on one of its rockets but flight tests have, so far, failed. The Nautilus was another project for the group and was a bigger success. In 2014, Madsen left the group to focus on other projects, one of which being the UC3 Nautilus.\n\nThe UC3 Nautilus submarine association was formed in order to separate ownership of the sub from Copenhagen Suborbitals. But within a year, Madsen was feuding with the board of that organization over who the proper owner of Nautilus really was. A statement on the association's website claims that board members received a text message from Madsen that read in part, \"You may think that a curse is lying on Nautilus. That curse is me.\" After several rounds of negotiation, the board decided to cede ownership of the vessel to Madsen.\n\nThe submarine's tumultuous journey is now at an end. But many questions remain unanswered. First and foremost, authorities are scrambling to find the missing journalist that was last seen with Madsen. Police divers are reportedly searching the area for the UC3 Nautilus wreckage. The Danish navy is also encouraging members of the public who have the right equipment to help with the search.", "time": "16:31:00"}

submarine Saturday to be held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nHe has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel, named the UC3 Nautilus, went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned to Copenhagen as expected, prompting a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats.

court ordered the owner of an amateur-built submarine Saturday to be held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist who had been on the ship before it sank.\n\nPeter Madsen was arrested Friday on preliminary manslaughter charges, hours after his 40-ton, nearly 18-meter-long (60-foot-long) submarine sank off Denmark's eastern coast.\n\nHe has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying the journalist disembarked before his vessel, named the UC3 Nautilus, went down.\n\nJudge Kari Soerensen announced the ruling after a two-hour custody hearing held behind closed doors.\n\nMadsen's defense lawyer, Bettina Hald Engmark, said her client maintains his innocence. He is \"willing to cooperate\" and hasn't decided whether to appeal the detention ruling, Hald Engmark said.\n\nBefore the hearing was closed, the courtroom was packed with Danish and Swedish reporters and the 46-year-old Madsen's relatives. Madsen smiled and chatted with his lawyer.\n\n\"I would very much like to express myself,\" he said after the preliminary charges were read.\n\nProsecutor Louise Pedersen said Madsen faces the preliminary manslaughter charge \"for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5 p.m.\"\n\nWall's boyfriend alerted authorities early Friday that the sub had not returned to Copenhagen as expected, prompting a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said the sub was seen sailing, but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship on Friday, told The Associated Press he first spotted Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak said. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped Wall off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" her family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Sweden-born freelance journalist studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lived in New York and Peking, her family said, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among other publications.\n\nA salvage vessel, the Vina, on Saturday raised the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer. The submarine was brought up some 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) off the coast and is expected to be transported to land at some point.\n\nIn theory, the Nautilus can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to Madsen's business web site.\n\nIf tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "15:37:00"}

sinking.\n\nBelieve it or not, there's a crowdsourced, open source non-profit attempting to build a sea-launched suborbital rocket. Called Copenhagen Suborbitals, it even had access to a sub. A club associated with the venture completed a submarine in 2008, designed by Peter Madsen, a Danish inventor who is co-founder of the group. That submarine is now at the bottom of the sea, and Madsen is being held by Danish authorities on suspicion of \"unlawful killing\" -- a precursor charge to manslaughter or murder.\n\nThe UV3 Nautilus was the third and largest submarine effort by the club, costing $200,000 to construct. It served as a workhorse for Copenhagen Suborbitals, helping push the group's Sputnik rocket launch platform into position on a number of occasions. Nautilus is -- or was -- powered by two diesel engines above the surface and by batteries underwater. While it could hold a crew of four underwater, all of its controls could be managed by a single person from its control room.\n\nBy 2011, the sub needed an overhaul. But the repairs required more than Copenhagen Suborbitals could afford to sink into the Nautilus. So in 2013, the group launched an Indiegogo campaign to get it back in the water. In a video, Madsen described the sub and the inspiration behind it.\n\nThe crowdfunding project fell short, and Madsen eventually took possession of the Nautilus himself to finish the job. His efforts drew the attention of a Swedish journalist, who took a trip with Madsen on the sub this week. The reporter had said she was writing a story for Wired (though she was not on assignment for Wired in the US, and was not formally employed by the UK edition of the publication). Madsen was seen departing with her around 7pm local time on August 10 from Refshale Island (Refshale\u00f8en), an industrial area east of Copenhagen.\n\nAt 3:30am Friday, the Copenhagen Police received a call from Denmark's Joint Rescue Coordination Center (JRCC) indicating that the Nautilus had not returned from what was supposed to be a trial run. About 7 hours later, a harbormaster reported spotting the submarine passing Drogden Lighthouse, in K\u00f8ge Bay, well south of Copenhagen's harbor. Madsen spoke with the harbormaster, via radio, indicating that he was headed for the harbor. When asked why he had not been in contact with the harbor, he said that he had been experiencing technical issues.\n\nBut he never made it back to the harbor. According to the police report, \"At 11.00 the submarine suddenly sank and the owner was subsequently rescued on a private motorboat sailing [near] him in port.\"\n\nAfter being rescued, Madsen told Denmark's TV2 that \"a minor problem with a ballast tank... turned into a major issue.\" The ballast tank, which holds air or water to vary the submarine's buoyancy, apparently filled with water unexpectedly. The Nautilus' hatches were open, so as the sub started to submerge it began to flood. Madsen said that the sub was gone in 30 seconds. If he had been below decks instead of in the small mast of the sub, he would have been killed.\n\nBut Madsen didn't mention his passenger. When questioned by the police, he said that he had dropped the woman off Thursday evening near where they had departed from, around 10:30pm. But no one had been able to reach the woman or establish her whereabouts.\n\nPolice are still seeking anyone who may have seen the woman or the submarine on Thursday night. A search effort was still underway as of this evening, and the submarine has been located at the bottom of the bay in 7 meters (22 feet) of water, but divers had not been able to enter the sub to check for a body.", "time": "22:12:00"}

Danish police said on Saturday they were preparing to search a sunken submarine owned by Danish inventor Peter Madsen who has been charged with the inadvertent manslaughter of a journalist.\n\nThe police said that Madsen, 46, was being held in custody for 24 days, accused of killing Swedish woman Kim Wall, 30, who they said had been on his submarine before it sank on Friday.\n\nMadsen was rescued on Friday morning in a navy operation and taken ashore after his homemade 17-metre submarine went down.\n\nThe vessel was recovered on Saturday in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen, at a depth of seven metres, and taken into harbour.\n\nIt will be partly drained of water and searched by the police late on Saturday and early Sunday.\n\nMadsen, an entrepreneur known as an artist, submarine builder and aerospace engineer, went before a judge on Saturday behind closed doors for preliminary questioning. His defence lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, told Reuters he denied the charges.\n\nThe police said on Friday the inventor had said he had dropped Wall off in Copenhagen on Thursday night.\n\nThe police in Sweden said they had tried without success to contact her by phone and that her family had not heard from her.\n\nThe submarine, UC3 Nautilus, is one of three constructed by Madsen. It can carry eight people.

He has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying she had disembarked earlier.\n\nThe woman's boyfriend alerted authorities that the sub had not returned, prompting a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said that the sub had been spotted sailing but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship, sailed out immediately Friday and saw Madsen standing in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink.\"\n\n\"There was no loud noise, no metallic noise, just a lot of air coming out,\" Isbak told The Associated Press.\n\n\"Madsen came up again stayed in the tower until water came into it as the submarine started sinking,\" Isbak said. He \"then swam over to another (private) boat that was next to him. I was in a boat a few meters (yards) away and could it see it.\"\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped the woman off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\nA salvage vessel was Saturday working on raising the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer.\n\nIn theory, the vessel can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to its Web site.\n\nThe hearing starts at 1200 GMT. If tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

First launched in 2008, the ship was famous for being the world's biggest privately owned submarine, but it had sat in disrepair for seven years until April.\n\nMadsen said in an interview with a Danish television station that the trip spun into chaos after a \"minor problem\" with a mechanism meant to balance the craft turned into a \"major issue.\"\n\n\"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close any hatches or anything,\" he said, per The Guardian. \"But I guess that was pretty good because I otherwise still would have been down there.\"\n\nWall is a 30-year-old freelance journalist whose work appeared in major outlets all over the world, including the New York Times, Harper's Magazine, and Foreign Policy (she's also done reporting for Mashable that was never published for reasons unrelated to the quality of substance of her work). Some of her past pieces include a feature story on a massive dome of nuclear waste on an island in the Pacific and in-depth reportage on a nascent Cuban internet culture.\n\nCopenhagen police said they've located the sunken submarine, but it will have to be airlifted to land before they can enter.\n\nBefore the submarine's relaunch, Madsen had been locked in a fierce ownership dispute with a board representing the group of volunteers who helped him build it.\n\nMadsen ultimately won out, but during one round of negotiations, he apparently sent board members an foreboding message that now reads in a more jarring light.\n\n\"You may think that a curse is lying on Nautilus,\" he wrote, according to the association's statement at the time. \"That curse is me.

He has denied responsibility for the fate of 30-year-old Kim Wall, saying she had disembarked earlier.\n\nThe woman's boyfriend alerted authorities that the sub had not returned, prompting a major search involving two helicopters, three ships and several private boats. The Navy said that the sub had been spotted sailing but then sank shortly afterward.\n\nKristian Isbak, who had responded to the Navy's call to help locate the ship, sailed out immediately Friday and saw Madsen standing wearing his trademark military fatigues in the submarine's tower while it was still afloat.\n\n\"He then climbed down inside the submarine and there was then some kind of air flow coming up and the submarine started to sink,\" Isbak told The Associated Press. \"(He) came up again and stayed in the tower until water came into it\" before swimming to a nearby boat as the submarine sank, he added.\n\nMadsen told authorities he had dropped the woman off on an island in Copenhagen's harbor a few hours into their Thursday night trip.\n\n\"It is with great dismay that we received the news that Kim went missing during an assignment in Denmark,\" the family said in statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe 30-year-old Sweden-born freelance journalist had studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York where she graduated with a master's degree in journalism in 2013.\n\nShe lives in New York and Peking, the family said, and has written for the New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among others.\n\nA salvage vessel, the Vina, was Saturday working on raising the submarine, which was seven meters (23 feet) under water off Copenhagen's south island of Dragoer.\n\nIn theory, the vessel can dive up to 470 meters (1,550 feet) but has rarely gone deeper than 40 meters (132 feet), according to its Web site.\n\nThe hearing starts at 1200 GMT. If tried and found guilty, Madsen would face between five years and life in prison.", "time": "13:01:00"}

resources to carry out an exhaustive inquiry into Kim Wall's fate and whereabouts,\" CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. \"Denmark should not be considered a dangerous assignment for journalists.\"\n\nAccording to a statement Wall's family shared with CPJ today, the 30-year-old Swedish-born journalist, who was based in New York and Beijing, was working on a story about inventor Peter Madsen when she went missing. Madsen was the owner of the sunk submarine. \"It is with a great concern that we, her family, received the news that Kim is missing after an interview with Peter Madsen in Denmark,\" the statement said. \"We sincerely hope that she will be found and that she is well.\"\n\nA Danish court today ordered that Madsen be held in pre-trial detention while authorities investigate Wall's disappearance, the Associated Press reported. The court decision follows Madsen's arrest yesterday on preliminary murder charges. The inventor has denied wrongdoing and said that he dropped Wall--who was reported to be the only other person on board the submarine with him--off on an island close to Copenhagen Thursday night before the submarine sank, according to AP reports.", "time": "19:24:00"}

The 26-foot submarine sank just as Mr. Madsen jumped into the water and swam toward a rescue boat, a rescuer said.\n\nAs he was brought to shore, Mr. Madsen told the local television station TV2 that he had been on a test drive when he ran into problems with a valve on a ballast tank on the vessel.\n\n\"I was toying with various things on the submarine and then an error occurred,\" he said, adding he had only 30 seconds to leave the vessel before it sank.\n\nAccording to a police statement, Mr. Madsen said he dropped off Ms. Wall in a remote part of the port of Copenhagen around 10.30 p.m. and continued alone.\n\nA family statement sent by Tom Wall, Ms. Wall's brother, said that she had been with Mr. Madsen for an interview when she vanished. \"We sincerely hope that she will be found and that she is well,\" the statement said.\n\nMs. Wall is a graduate of Columbia University, and her work has appeared in a wide range of international publications including The New York Times.\n\nChristopher Harres, a Columbia graduate and an investigative journalist in Mobile, Ala., said of Ms Wall: \"She was literally loved everywhere she went. Her smile and charm could get her into events and past police cordons. Her smile filled your heart, her humor and hilarious observations could put you on the floor.\"\n\nHe added: \"Kim embodied everything that was good in journalism and storytelling. She reported from North Korea, China and all over Europe. She had wanderlust in droves and it hung off her every word.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the authorities raised the vessel from a depth of seven feet and started taking it to shore. Divers were unable to enter the submarine.\n\nFor years Mr. Madsen has led a community of amateurs in Copenhagen working to launch the world's first manned amateur space rocket. Other members of the community successfully launched an unmanned rocket 1.7 miles into the air in 2011.\n\nMr. Madsen had planned three launches this summer in preparation for a possible space mission in 2019 with only himself onboard.\n\nHe's been described in the local media as a maverick and a \"Gyro Gearloose\" with high ambitions and low social skills.\n\n\"He argues with every Tom, Dick and Harry. I've argued with him as well. But that's what it's like with people driven by deep passion,\" Thomas Djursing, an editor who wrote a book about Mr. Madsen, told the daily newspaper BT.\n\nIn 2015, the inventor had a severe argument over ownership of the UC3 Nautilus with an association formed to support his plans to build the submarine. In the end, his supporters pulled out.\n\nIn a message published on the association's website two years ago, his associates quoted a text message from Mr. Madsen that rings ominously today: \"A curse lies over Nautilus. That curse is me. There will not be calm around Nautilus as long as I exist.\"", "time": "15:39:00"}

afterwards in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen.\n\nMadsen escaped from the submarine as it sank and was rescued by a private boat.\n\nHe told Denmark's TV2 channel there had been a problem with a ballast tank and that it only took 30 seconds for the sub to sink.\n\nA salvage vessel has raised the sub to the surface where it is expected to be transported back to land at some point.\n\nThe decision to rescind Madsen in custody for a further 24 days was made by a judge after a two-hour custody hearing.\n\nMadsen's defence lawyer said her client maintains he is innocent but is \"willing to cooperate\" and has not decided whether to appeal the ruling.\n\nCopenhagen police have appealed for anyone who may have seen Ms Wall to contact them.\n\nThey described her as \"160cm tall, 56kg, 30 years old, with reddish-brown hair and green eyes\".\n\nShe was wearing an orange blouse with long sleeves, a black and white floral skirt, nylon stockings and white tennis shoes when she disappeared.\n\nAccording to her family Ms Wall lived in New York and Beijing, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among others.",

journalist who joined him for the voyage was reported missing.\n\nDanish authorities announced early Friday they were looking for the Nautilus sub, reported to have gone missing the night before in Oresund straight between Denmark and Sweden.\n\nPeter Madsen denies killing the Swedish woman, saying he last saw her when he dropped her off on the tip of an island in Copenhagen late Thursday.\n\nThe journalist, who has not been named, had been writing about Mr Madsen and the submarine, according to Danish and Swedish media. \"But I guess that was pretty good because otherwise I still would have been down there\".\n\nThe ballast tank is a compartment that holds water, which is used as ballast to provide stability for a vessel. But Damgaard later said the 40 tonne submarine, which is almost 18 metres long, had sunk.\n\nThe police in Sweden said they had tried without success to contact the woman by phone. She also was not identified by name.\n\nSwedish police said they are investigating the whereabouts of a missing woman who had been on the submarine at some point.\n\n\"My passion is finding ways to travel to worlds beyond the well-known\", Madsen wrote on the site. \"Diving, no matter the method, is very challenging and it*s technically hard to go to beyond where rubber suits and scuba gear can take us\".\n\nTwo helicopters, three ships and members of the public were involved in the search after the journalist's boyfriend reported the sub had not returned from the trip, which had apparently set sail at 7pm from Refshale Island.\n\nMadsen told police after he was rescued in Koge Bay that the vessel sank due to technical problems with a ballast tank.\n\nLisa Leff contributed from London.\n\nRelated News: 12 August 2017 Tesla is climbing after debuting the Model 3 Canaccord Genuity Increases Zillow Group, Inc.

At that time the Nautilus had logged more than 1,000 dives and had a team of 10 volunteers working on her refurbishment.\n\nIn 2015, after a dispute with the group of volunteers maintaining it, ownership of the Nautilus was transferred to Mr Madsen, says a statement on the website (in Danish).\n\n\"You may think that a curse is lying on Nautilus. That curse is me,\" he had messaged members of the board, according to the statement. \"There will not be peace on Nautilus for as long as I exist.\"\n\nThe craft finally re-launched earlier this year. It has a diesel and an electric motor and is 17.8m in length.\n\nAccording to the crowd-funding page, Danish law prohibited the Nautilus's operators from taking on passengers, but the team offered tours of the craft while docked \"to give you the full experience of being aboard a real submarine\".\n\nBoth Rocket-Madsens Space Laboratory and Copenhagen Suborbitals - which Mr Madsen co-founded but has since left - are trying to become the first non-government, all-volunteer organisation to launch a human being into space.\n\nThe two organisations are in conflict over their launch area, and seem to communicate via blog warfare.", "time": "13:13:00"}

This prompted a search by the Danish Navy.\n\nWhile the navy apparently found the Nautilus and her captain, Peter Madsen, on the sea's surface, it appears that the boat foundered shortly afterwards as a result of \"technical problems\", judging by other accounts.\n\nOne Swedish journalist aboard the submarine who was reportedly put ashore before the boat ran into trouble has not yet been accounted for, according to Danish newspaper Berlingske. Bloomberg News reported that Madsen told a local TV station about the sinking, revealing that a problem with a ballast tank caused the crowdfunded vessel to sink.\n\nBallast tanks are used to dive and surface a submarine by changing its buoyancy. When the tanks are filled with water, the submarine sinks; when they are pumped out with compressed air, the sub rises.\n\n\"It took about 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close any hatches or anything,\" Madsen was reported as saying. \"But I guess that was pretty good because I otherwise still would have been down there.\"\n\nThe Nautilus itself was launched in 2008, having been built by Madsen and a group of friends. The Wikipedia entry for the boat appears to have been written by someone familiar with the Nautilus's design and systems, judging by the level of detail. While her theoretical crush depth is given as \"400m-500m\", this seems a tad optimistic. Proper naval submarines tend to operate at these levels, and the 18-metre Nautilus is far smaller than those.\n\nThe boat was reportedly equipped with a fully functional snorkel system as well, allowing her to use her diesel engines for propulsion while submerged just below the surface. Her maximum speed was given as a stately 9 knots. A few years ago a crowdfunding project to raise $50,000 for a refit fell well short of its target.\n\nThe Nautilus was unarmed, though was reportedly well equipped with video cameras and portholes for observation. She was relaunched in April this year after a six-year refit, if Wikipedia is to be believed.\n\nPrivate submarines, as distinct from submersibles used for scientific research and the like, are vanishingly rare. The traditional size and hull form of submarines is driven by their need to carry armaments, sensors and a crew to operate them; the size is simply not necessary when you don't need half a dozen torpedo tubes in the bows and stern of your boat, or a ballistic missile compartment in the middle of it. Scientific and private submersibles, as a result, tend to resemble crabs with bulbous heads rather than missiles.\n\nNonetheless, the submarine hull form is now iconic, in the same way as Concorde will forever represent supersonic passenger aircraft. \u00ae", "time": "14:58:00"}

No obstante, la polic\u00eda reconoci\u00f3 que la reportera sigue desaparecida y avanz\u00f3 adem\u00e1s que parece que el sospechoso hundi\u00f3 \"de forma deliberada\" el submarino. \"Seguimos esperando encontrar a Kim Wall con vida, pero nos preparamos para la eventualidad de que no sea as\u00ed\", asegur\u00f3 el jefe de Homicidios de Copenhague, Jens Moller, en rueda de prensa.\n\nEl detenido, por su parte, se ha declarado inocente, asegura que la periodista sueca desembarc\u00f3 antes de que su submarino -de casi 18 metros de largo y 40 toneladas- se hundiese en la costa oriental danesa y quedase a unos 7 metros de profundidad. La abogada de Madsen, Bettina Hald Engmark, asegur\u00f3 en declaraciones a los medios que su cliente est\u00e1 \"deseoso de cooperar\" con la justicia.\n\nSeg\u00fan las primeras reconstrucciones de los hechos, Wall se cit\u00f3 en la tarde del pasado jueves en el puerto de Copenhague con Madsen para conocer su submarino, llamado \"UC3 Nautilus\", sobre el que la joven sueca estaba preparando un reportaje. Ambos se embarcaron a continuaci\u00f3n en la nave y partieron para un peque\u00f1o viaje, punto a partir del cual la historia se complica.\n\nMadsen asegura que, tras un paseo de un par de horas, dej\u00f3 a Wall en Refshaleoen, una isla de Copenhague, a petici\u00f3n suya, pero la periodista no regres\u00f3 a su domicilio. El novio de la mujer denunci\u00f3 en la ma\u00f1ana del viernes la desaparici\u00f3n de Wall ante las autoridades danesas, que lanzaron una operaci\u00f3n de salvamento con dos helic\u00f3pteros, tres barcos y algunas embarcaciones privadas.\n\nEl submarino fue entonces detectado en la bah\u00eda de Koge, cerca la isla de Dragoer, con Madsen ya fuera, sobre la torre del aparato, pero se hundi\u00f3 poco despu\u00e9s. El inventor fue rescatado por una embarcaci\u00f3n privada. \"Estaba en un viaje de prueba y prob\u00e9 unas cuantas cosas en el submarino. Entonces pas\u00f3 algo con el tanque de lastre\", explic\u00f3 el propio Madsen en declaraciones a medios daneses tras su rescate.\n\nTras ser localizado a unos siete metros de profundidad, el \"UC3 Nautilus\" fue arrastrado por un barco de salvamento unos siete kil\u00f3metros y depositado en la costa para que sea transportado a tierra firme. En una primera inspecci\u00f3n, las fuerzas de seguridad no encontraron ning\u00fan cuerpo a bordo, indic\u00f3 Moller. Seg\u00fan la p\u00e1gina web de Madsen, el submarino pod\u00eda sumergirse hasta 470 metros de profundidad, aunque habitualmente no desciende m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los 40.", "time": "17:38:00"}], "count": 1, "page": 1}}}

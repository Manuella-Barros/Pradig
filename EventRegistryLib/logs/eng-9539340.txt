We've worked hard to create an amazing event for you, and we are just as disappointed as you are.\"\n\nAs recently as Thursday, the social media accounts were updating guests on information such as parking procedures, walking directions and rideshare meeting points.\n\nThe lineup was expected to include more than 70 acts on five stages, beginning just before noon and running until after midnight.\n\nThe bill was to feature Nelly Furtado playing her first Vegas show in 17 years, M.I.A. bringing the noise with her clamorous alt-hip-hop, as well as Gwen Stefani, Ciara, TLC, Brandy, Eve and plenty more female stars.\n\nFans react\n\nResponses to the post were quick to flood in, with many expressing anger about having already arrived in Las Vegas for the show and requesting travel reimbursement.\n\n\"A 12-hour notice is disgusting,\" one account responded.\n\nOthers were complaining that the weather on Friday night was just fine. But the weather service warned Friday that patchy blowing dust is expected after 1 p.m. Saturday. Winds could gust as high as 41 mph.\n\nClark County has issued an air quality dust advisory for Saturday and Sunday, advising people to use precautions to limit their exposure to blowing dust.\n\nWeather festival woes\n\nThis is not the first time bad weather, especially strong winds, has affected a Las Vegas festival.\n\n-- In October 2022, the much anticipated debut of the When We Were Young festival was canceled because of high winds. The festival picked up the next day.\n\n-- In May 2019, strong winds shut down the main stage during the Electric Daisy Carnival at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

The single-day festival fulfilled the dreams of many millennials, showcasing headliners like Usher, Janet Jackson, Backstreet Boys, and Alicia Keys.\n\nThe festival website stated that organizers had been closely monitoring the weather for days and taking proactive measures for a potentially windy Saturday. Despite their preparations, the National Weather Service issued a High Wind Warning, forecasting sustained winds of 30-35 mph and gusts exceeding 60 mph. Considering this advice and consulting with local authorities, organizers concluded that canceling tomorrow's Lovers & Friends Festival was the safest choice for attendees, performers, and staff.\n\nReactions To Lovers And Friends Festival Cancellation\n\nEven though the festival did its best to keep everyone safe, the news left attendees pretty upset. They vented their frustrations on social media.\n\nThis wasn't the festival's first bump in the road. Initially, it caused confusion when Blige was announced as one of the 2024 artists, only for her to deny it. A few days later, though, Blige confirmed her participation and a new flyer put her name first as a headliner.\n\nLast year, Lil Jon considered a potential lawsuit against Live Nation. During the 2022 festival, a mistaken gun scare caused panic among the crowd. The incident resulted in three attendees' hospitalization with minor injuries.\n\nAnd let's not forget when the inaugural Lovers & Friends lineup went public in 2020. Multiple singers and rappers publicly stated that they had no knowledge of their participation in the event, while others expressed dissatisfaction with the lineup.\n\nBelow you'll find the complete cancellation statement.", "source": {"uri": "bossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bossip"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_and_Friends_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lovers and Friends (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Usher (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_It_Again_(The_Beach_Boys_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Do It Again (The Beach Boys song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludacris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ludacris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Jon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lil Jon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Keys", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alicia Keys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Janet Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Backstreet Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live Nation Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Festivals", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/05/17148590111835.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1&strip=all&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539340", "eventUri": "eng-9539340", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, after a successful two-and-a-half days, the BeachLife Festival ended a few hours early on Sunday as dangerous winds cut through Southern California.\n\nOrganizers of BeachLife, held in Redondo Beach, initially evacuated the festival while ZZ Top were performing on the Lowtide Stage yesterday afternoon around 5 p.m. Then, a decision was made to call off the last four hours of the event including sets from Fleet Foxes, Trey Anastasio and Classic TAB and My Morning Jacket.\n\nBeachLife Festival organizers posted the following note on social media explaining the decision:\n\nIt is with great sadness that we must cancel our programming at BeachLife this Sunday evening, due to a serious wind event that put the general public at risk. While we take extraordinary measures to keep our fans and artists safe, and while absolutely none of our engineered structures or systems failed, winds quickly reached very dangerous speeds and we put safety first. Alongside the Redondo Beach Police and Fire Chiefs, our Ownership made a collective decision that to continue would be unsafe and put people's life in peril. No show is worth a life, and in our Community, BeachLife stays committed above all to put the safety of our kids, families and music lovers first. In the coming days, we will be unwinding the collateral consequences of this decision, and we ask for your support and patience while we do.\n\nPlease go to the main entrance if you have items left in the festival and we will escort you in. Thank you for your understanding and we'll see you soon.\n\nThe third annual Lovers & Friends festival was supposed to take place on Saturday, May 4 at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds. Usher, Janet Jackson, Backstreet Boys, Gwen Stefani and Mary J. Blige topped a lineup focusing on R&B and hip-hop artists. Organizers announced the one-day event's cancelation on the eve of its opening.\n\n\"Lovers & Friends Festival organizers have been monitoring the weather for several days and proactively preparing for a windy Saturday,\" wrote the event's producers in a note announcing the decision to cancel. \"However, the National Weather Service has now issued a High Wind Warning, including dangerous 30-35 mph sustained winds with gusts potentially more than 60 mph.

This year, the lineup for Lovers & Friends Fest included (takes deep breath) Usher, Janet Jackson, Mary J. Blige, Lil Wayne, Gwen Stefani, Ludacris, Ashanti, Nelly, Snoop Dogg, Alicia Keys, Ciara, Nas, Method Man and Redman, TLC, Backstreet Boys, Keyshia Cole, Brandy, Monica, Cam'ron, T-Pain, Sean Paul, Jodeci (I assume without Martin Lawrence showing up to interrupt their set), Xscape, Fat Joe, Ginuwine (a.k.a. Donna Meagle's cousin), and many more, with the concert scheduled to happen on May 4 from 11 AM to midnight.\n\nTwelve hours before Lovers & Friends Fest was scheduled to begin, the Instagram account for the concert announced that the entire show was canceled due to dangerously high winds that could potentially put the lives of the artists and the audience in jeopardy.\n\nFrom the website for Lovers & Friends Fest:\n\nSaturday's Lovers & Friends Festival at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds has been canceled. Lovers & Friends Festival organizers have been monitoring the weather for several days and proactively preparing for a windy Saturday. However, the National Weather Service has now issued a High Wind Warning, including dangerous 30-35 mph sustained winds with gusts potentially more than 60 mph. Following advice from the National Weather Service and in consultation with local public officials, we must make the safest decision for our fans, artists, and staff, and cancel tomorrow's Lovers & Friends Festival.\n\nRegardless of the reason why Lovers & Friends Fest was canceled, there were many people who were understandably disappointed and pissed the f -- k off by this news. Not just because of the cancellation, but how the news of the cancellation was handled. It was done at the very last minute, with no e-mails or text messages sent out to ticket holders, and then, they were told that refunds for tickets wouldn't go into effect for an entire month. The amounts of money that ticket holders spent on plane tickets, hotel rooms, and brand-new outfits for them to wear while two-stepping and shaking their asses (while watching themselves)? All gone. Some of them didn't learn about the cancellation until they landed in Vegas. The money they spent on hotel rooms wouldn't be refunded, since the hotels had nothing to do with Lovers & Friends Fest, so it wasn't their responsibility. Any and all vendors with loads of merchandise that they were planning to sell at the concert? Completely assed out.\n\nSome people were hoping that the artists scheduled to appear at Lovers & Friends Fest would do pop-up shows around Vegas to make up for the festival's cancellation and do a little something to lift their spirits after receiving the terrible news. However, it doesn't look like any pop-up shows occurred, though one of the artists expected to perform at the festival had a brief interaction with a fan this past weekend.\n\nUsher went on Twitter to express his disappointment that Lovers & Friends Fest wasn't going to proceed as planned, while also pointing out that it wasn't entirely his decision to make.\n\nReading about the cancellation of Lovers & Friends Fest reminded me far too much of the massive catastrof-ck that was Universal FanCon back in April of 2018. The last-minute cancellation announcements; the huge lineup of performers and events that convinced people to spend money and make plans to attend; the lack of a backup plan to make up for any sudden obstacles; and the amount of people online expressing their anger and disappointment about their plans suddenly going pear-shaped. There is a vast difference between why Universal FanCon failed (piss-poor planning and handling of finances), and why Lovers & Friends Fest was canceled (potentially dangerous weather that could ruin an event held at an outdoor arena), but they both resulted in a lot of customers being broke and unhappy, and caught completely off-guard with the news that their plans were going nowhere. And no matter what the event is that you have planned (a concert, a comic book/pop culture convention, an interactive experience based on Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory), there should be no reason whatsof-ckingever for anyone to compare it to Universal FanCon.\n\nThere was also talk on social media about how Lovers & Friends Fest has seemed incredibly shady even for those who had attended in the past. The festival was announcing that artists like Monica would be there to perform on stage ... except that Monica admitted she was never actually booked to perform by the festival organizers. And there were other artists who shared similar stories about how their names were being used to sell tickets for a festival they weren't even signed to be a part of.\n\nTwitter was also divided as to just how bad Saturday's weather was, and whether it was even necessary for Lovers & Friends to be canceled in the first place. But at least one Twitter user shared their input as to what could've easily happened if the festival went ahead as planned.\n\nThe cancellation of Lovers & Friends Fest wasn't the only concert-related news that became public this weekend. Brian McKnight, who has recently revealed himself to be a f-ck nigga of biblical proportions, was scheduled to perform at the Motor City Casino Hotel in Detroit on June 9. But it was just announced that McKnight's concert has been canceled as well, and it is largely believed to be because of the cruelty and disrespect that McKnight has expressed towards his adult children, even referring to them as \"products of sin.\" McKnight's fanbase has been dwindling as quickly as his hairline ever since, and when Motor City Casino Hotel announced on Facebook that his concert wasn't happening, the response was so overwhelmingly negative towards McKnight that the original post ended up being deleted.\n\nNow please excuse me as I take a moment from expressing sadness on behalf of everyone who bought a ticket to Lovers & Friends Fest, so I can express my joy at something bad happening to the R&B singer who will never win the award for \"Father of the Year,\" and who has cursed us all with an actual song called \"Let Me Show You How Your Pu -- y Works.\"", "source": {"uri": "pajiba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pajiba"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_richards@pajiba.com", "name": "Brian Richards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_and_Friends_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lovers and Friends (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Festival_Grounds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Festival Grounds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Usher (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_Man_&_Redman", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Method Man & Redman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xscape_(group)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xscape (group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam'ron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cam'ron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginuwine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ginuwine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodeci", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jodeci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Pain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_J._Blige", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mary J.

When it was first announced in 2020, several artists on its lineup denied their involvement.

Charles Sykes/Invision via Associated Press\n\nThousands of fans who planned to see artists such as Ciara, Nelly Furtado and Gwen Stefani perform at a sold-out Las Vegas music festival this weekend woke up to a sweeping change of plans Saturday, after organizers canceled the event because of expected heavy winds.\n\nThe Lovers &amp; Friends Festival, a nostalgia-laden hip-hop and R&amp;B event, was supposed to kick off Saturday on the Sin City's festival grounds with big names including Janet Jackson, Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige and Usher.\n\nThe fest has had a history of snags throughout its short existence, but what would have been its third iteration seemed to be on track as late as Friday. Merchandise was still being promoted on social media and ticket holders and artists were boarding planes to Vegas.\n\nThat all changed with an overnight statement from organizers.\n\nPlanners said they had been \"monitoring the weather for several days and proactively preparing for a windy Saturday,\" but decided it was too unsafe after advice from public officials and the National Weather Service, which warned of high winds and \"gusts potentially more than 60 mph.\"\n\n\"This was an incredibly heartbreaking decision to make as we are aware that fans have traveled from all over the world to enjoy this incredible lineup of superstars and have been looking forward to this event for several months,\" the statement said. \"We've worked hard to create an amazing event for you, and we are just as disappointed as you are.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Mannn ... I'm just as disappointed as you are,\" Usher said in an Instagram Story on Saturday morning. He planned to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his fourth album \"Confessions\" at the festival. \"We were getting ready to turn up and celebrate today.\"\n\nAnother would-be-performer, JoJo, saw the logic in canceling. \"We put so much into this show &amp; i was so excited. But it's way more important ppl don't get blown tf over by 1 billion mph winds\" she wrote on X. \"We make plans and God is like hold onnn just one second there buddy.\"\n\nKeith Lee, a popular Las Vegas-based food critic on TikTok, invited some of his favorite local restaurants to serve food at the festival's FamiLee Food Section. \"This is devastating for these small restaurants,\" he said in a video after learning of the cancellation. They \"have put damn near everything that they have into this, and now it's not happening. So everybody's scrambling and trying to figure out what we're going to do.\"\n\nAnyone who purchased tickets through official channels - starting prices ranged from $325 to $695 - will receive a refund within 30 days, organizers said. But those who had booked flights and hotel rooms for the one-day festival expressed their dissatisfaction with the last-minute switch-up.\n\n\"All I know is by tomorrow, Dorothy's whole house betta be flying by with Toto too, cause this is some nonsense,\" one person wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe festival has experienced its fair share of upsets even before this year's cancellation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Lovers &amp; Friends was first announced in 2020, its legitimacy was called into question after several artists on its lineup denied their involvement. That year's event was later canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe festival finally debuted in Vegas in 2022. Three attendees later sued organizers, claiming they failed to provide adequate safety and security measures when rumors of gunfire at the event caused them to be trampled in a stampede. The case is still pending.\n\nLast year, Rolling Stone reported that Lil Jon considered suing Live Nation over the name of the festival, which shares a name with his group's 2004 song. Organizers didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.\n\nWhen the festival announced its star-studded lineup earlier this year, Mary J. Blige said on Instagram that her \"inclusion was an error\" and that she'd be rehearsing for her Strength of a Woman Festival &amp; Summit. A day later, Blige's name had a bigger and better placement on the festival poster, and Lovers &amp; Friends confirmed on social media that she would be performing.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: extreme weather, Las Vegas Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciara", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ciara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Usher (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_J._Blige", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mary J.

Organizers pulled the plug on the event, citing safety concerns over \"dangerous weather\" predicted by the National Weather Service.\n\nThe forecast included \"dangerous 30-35 mph sustained winds with gusts potentially more than 60 mph,\" leading to a unanimous decision to cancel the event in the interest of the safety of fans, artists, and staff alike.\n\nFans were particularly looking forward to unique acts such as Lil Wayne performing \"Tha Carter III\" in its entirety and Usher celebrating the 20th anniversary of his classic album Confessions. Unfortunately, the dramatic change in weather dashed the hopes of attendees and performers, turning anticipation into disappointment.\n\nOrganizers expressed their distress over the cancellation, acknowledging the impact on fans who had traveled from far and wide. \"This was an incredibly heartbreaking decision to make as we are aware that fans have traveled from all over the world to enjoy this incredible lineup of superstars and have been looking forward to this event for several months. We've worked hard to create an amazing event for you, and we are just as disappointed as you are,\" said the festival's organizers in their announcement.\n\nThe abrupt cancellation comes against the backdrop of a series of challenges that the festival faced since its inception in 2020, including a potential lawsuit, a false alarm gun scare, and early confusion among artists about their participation. Despite these setbacks, organizers had pledged a spectacular show for 2024, only to be thwarted by Mother Nature.\n\nIn a statement that mirrored the sentiment across all communications, organizers reassured fans that all ticket holders would receive a refund within 30 days, aiming to soften the blow for those who had eagerly awaited the festival.

We were getting ready to turn up and celebrate today,\" Usher wrote on X/Twitter. I have to follow the orders of city officials and the National Weather Service for everyone's protection and stand strong in my belief that everything happens for a reason.

I'll see you soon.\"\n\nJanet Jackson, who was also set to perform echoed similar sentiments, writing online:\n\nWe are heartbroken we won't be able to see you tonight at Lovers & Friends due to the possibility of dangerous winds. We know that many of you traveled far and wide to be here. The show would have also marked our last before we shift gears to the summer leg of the tour. We trust in God's plan and find light in knowing we'll be together again soon. We love you and are so grateful for you.\n\nFor singer Brandy, she hopped on Instagram to share her disappointment:\n\nIt's 10:05 and I should be stepping on the stage to perform for you all but sadly due to weather, the festival was canceled. I know many of you came from far and are so disappointed to hear the news just as I did last night; I worked really hard this past month, it was a lot of pressure but I was ready to give you a great show! Thank you to my entire team for your amazing work helping bring the vision to life. I hope one day sooner I can share with you all what we had planned!\n\nI'd rather be with all of you tonight but I know safety must come first. Thank you @loversandfriendsfest for allowing me a full day to rehearse this week. Your team and tech staff were so helpful, I appreciate the professionalism and dedication throughout it all. We were about to live it up on that Crunk Stage! Love you all.\n\nSinger Tank also shared his two cents in a somewhat comical post to Instagram: \"LOVERS AND FRIENDS CANCELLED!!!..

The cancellation, announced less than 24 hours before the kick-off, was attributed to a High Wind Warning from the National Weather Service, forecasting hazardous conditions including \"dangerous 30-35 mph sustained winds with gusts potentially more than 60 mph.\"\n\nJanet Jackson, one of the headliners, expressed her heartbreak over the cancellation on X (formerly Twitter), sharing how devastated she was for fans who made long journeys to see her perform.\n\nSimilarly, Kelly Rowland, set to reunite with her fans at the festival, shared her dismay on Instagram, apologizing to those who came early and appreciating everyone's support.\n\nUsher, too, reached out to his fans on social media, regretting the missed opportunity to connect but reassuring them of future plans to express his gratitude.\n\nThe festival's abrupt cancelation was not just a letdown for the artists; many fans vented their frustration over the timing of the announcement. Some had already traveled long distances, making sacrifices such as booking flights, securing accommodation, and arranging childcare, only to find out the event was off. Criticism also mounted over the festival's late communication of potential weather risks, with some attendees suggesting legal action.\n\nIn a bid to appease disappointed ticket-holders, the festival's organizers promised refunds within 30 days to the original form of payment, as stated in their official cancellation notice. While this gesture was a small consolation, it could not fully dampen the disappointment for both fans and artists alike.\n\nAside from the logistical and financial inconveniences caused by the cancellation, the situation highlighted the unpredictability of outdoor events and the critical importance of safety considerations. Despite the collective heartbreak, the cancellation served as a reminder that, in the face of nature's unpredictability, the well-being of fans, artists, and staff remains the top priority.\n\nAs the dust settles on what was to be a memorable day for the music community, both artists and fans look forward to the possibility of reconvening under safer circumstances. In the meantime, the Lovers & Friends festival remains a testament to the strength of the musical bond between artists and their supporters, even in the absence of the music itself.", "source": {"uri": "aceshowbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AceShowbiz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aceshowbiz_team@aceshowbiz.com", "name": "AceShowbiz Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_and_Friends_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lovers and Friends (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Usher (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janet Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Keys", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alicia Keys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R&B", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contemporary R&B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Festivals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2024/05/05/00223865.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539340", "eventUri": "eng-9539340", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

We've worked hard to create an amazing event for you, and we are just as disappointed as you are.\"\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the advisory came in around 11 a.m. PT on Friday, May 3, but the cancellation notice went out around 9:45 p.m. PT.\n\nNonetheless, Usher, other artists, and inconvenienced attendees reacted to the news.\n\n\"Mannn...I'm just as disappointed as you are,\" the singer wrote on social media. \"We were getting ready to turn up and celebrate today.

They seemed to have begun some pre-birthday festivities. Kandi posted a separate video of herself, Morton, and Shaw dancing and chanting, \"It's our muthaf-kin' birthday month,\" since they're all May babies.\n\nShe also posted an image of herself and her girls posing in swimsuits with the caption, \"No matter what, we're always gonna have a good a- time!

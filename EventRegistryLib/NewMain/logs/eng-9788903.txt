But her pick is still unknown", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris will introduce her new running mate at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening. The choice of her running mate remains a mystery, with potential finalists including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Harris' campaign plans to announce the announcement via video message before the rally, similar to how Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the 2020 pandemic-marred race.Vice President Kamala Harris will introduce her new running mate at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia - but with the event mere hours away, her choice remains a mystery. In recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania - one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin - that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed - though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Venues Are Chosen. The Only Thing Missing for Harris' Blitz is Her VP Choice", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of the running mate.\n\nAfter a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris must decide on her wingman before the two set off Tuesday on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the stakes of the election.\n\nEverything about her campaign has been rapid-fire out of necessity. She's only been a candidate for a little over two weeks, since President Joe Biden bowed out of the race following a dismal debate performance and escalating calls within the Democratic party for him to step aside. The Democratic National Committee chair said Friday that Harris had already secured enough votes to become the party's nominee and will accept the nomination Monday night when voting ends.\n\nAnd about 8 in 10 Democrats say they would be somewhat or very satisfied if Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted after Biden withdrew from the race.\n\nHarris has had to do condensed vetting of her potential running mates as the party's convention draws near. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks get in their final licks.\n\nHarris was zeroing in on three running mate contenders, whom she interviewed Sunday in Washington. They were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to a person familiar with the process who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. Three other men have been in the mix: Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz is in his second term as governor of Minnesota. He has made his state a bastion of liberal policy and, this year, one of the few states to protect fans buying tickets online for Taylor Swift concerts and other live events. He comes from rural America and in his first race for Congress, Walz upset a Republican incumbent.\n\nWalz spoke before an energetic crowd at a fundraiser Monday evening in downtown Minneapolis, but didn't drop any hints about his status on Harris' shortlist. But the governor spoke of a \"politics of joy\" that he hopes to spread on the campaign trail on behalf of Harris.\n\n\"We've got to run this campaign against the serious threat that's there, but we have to do it every single day with a sense of joy,\" he said.\n\nWalz also criticized Donald Trump and Republicans who wanted to regulate what books children read and undermine abortion rights.\n\nThe Minnesota Democratic Party, meanwhile, posted a booster for Walz online. \"IMPORTANT PSA: There's no 'T' sound in 'Walz' (But there is one in 'Vice President Walz'),\" the group wrote with a winking smiley face emoji.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles or 600 kilometers of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed.\n\nShapiro has prominent supporters, too, like Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate. A person familiar with the mayor's thinking said she had no insider knowledge about Harris' intentions.\n\nWhen asked about the veepstakes Monday, Shapiro said he had no information.\n\n\"I got nothing for you, man,\" he told an Associated Press reporter as he arrived at the Pennsylvania state capitol in Harrisburg. \"Have a great day.\"\n\nBoth Kelly and Shapiro have seen their detractors become more vocal as Harris closes in on a decision.\n\nSome labor groups have criticized Kelly, saying he opposes proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. The senator's office counters that while he did not co-sponsor the proposed legislation, he has said he would vote for it.\n\nThe nonprofit Institute for Middle East Understanding has been vocal about Shapiro, saying in a statement last week that he was not the right candidate for the job.\n\nShapiro has aggressively confronted what he views as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas as it Israel battles the militants in Gaza. But he's also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while suggesting that any end to the Israel-Hamas war requires the removal of Hamas from power.\n\nHarris and her running mate -- whoever that is -- will launch Tuesday into an aggressive battleground state tour that begins in Philadelphia on Tuesday and winds later in the week through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. A scheduled stop in Savannah, Georgia, was canceled due to the expected effects of Hurricane Debby.\n\nCampaign officials are aware that momentum can be fleeting and are working to capitalize on the energy now, while managing expectations by continuing to emphasize that the race with Republican nominee Donald Trump is tight. But the strong rollout has allowed the Harris campaign to put a number of states back in play that had been feared out of reach when Biden remained at the top of the ticket.\n\nTrump's running mate, JD Vance, was heading out on almost exactly the same campaign schedule as Harris: Philadelphia on Tuesday, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday and Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday.\n\nHe told Fox News on Sunday that Harris' pick doesn't matter to him. \"Whoever she chooses, the problem is going to be Kamala Harris' record and Kamala Harris' policies,\" he said, adding, \"It's not going to be good for the country.\"\n\nHarris' early rallies have attracted enthusiastic thousands. Campaign officials say each stop will be loaded with local election officials, religious leaders, union members and more in an effort to show the diversity of her coalition. Some Republicans will also appear with her, according to the campaign.\n\nThe campaign this week launched \"Republicans for Harris.\" The program will be a \"campaign within a campaign,\" according to Harris' team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N.

But her pick is still unknown", "body": "This composite left to right, shows Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, center, July 3, 2024, in Washington, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., June 4, 2024, in Washington, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, July 20, 2024, in Pittsburgh, and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in Frankfort, Ky., July 22, 2024. As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to announce her running mate, a new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that several of the top potential contenders for the role are largely unknown to voters.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris will introduce her new running mate at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia -- but with the event mere hours away, her choice remains a mystery.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Tim Walz to be her vice presidential running mate, three sources tell CBS News, tapping a Midwestern progressive to join her on the ticket heading into November's election.\n\nNews of the pick comes two weeks after President Biden ended his reelection campaign, prompting the Democratic Party to quickly coalesce around the vice president.\n\nHarris and Walz will campaign in all seven battleground states in the coming days, beginning with an appearance in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Walz's first event as Harris' running mate.\n\nWalz -- who has a background representing rural communities and enacting progressive priorities -- was part of a deep bench of potential running mates that included Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nWalz, the popular two-term governor of Minnesota, could help Harris shore up support in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- Midwestern \"blue wall\" states that have historically supported Democrats but went for Donald Trump in the 2016 election before Mr. Biden took them back in 2020. The three battleground states are likely pivotal to Harris' ability to win the White House in November.\n\nWhen Trump knocked down parts of the blue wall eight years ago, Minnesota remained Democratic by a narrow margin. The state hasn't voted for a Republican since 1972.\n\nWalz recently said he expected it would be a close presidential race in Minnesota, though he predicted Trump would lose for a third time. Trump has boasted about potentially winning the state while campaigning there in recent months.\n\nIn a signal that his stock was rising in the veepstakes, Harris' campaign recently began echoing an attack line first used by Walz, who called Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, \"weird.\"\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old Nebraska native, enlisted in the Army National Guard after high school and served for 24 years with both domestic and overseas deployments. He spent a year teaching high school in China after graduating from Chadron State College in 1989. When he returned to the U.S., he taught high school in Nebraska before moving to his wife's home state of Minnesota in 1996. There, Walz taught social studies at Mankato West High School and coached the football team.\n\nHis political career began in 2006, when he was elected to the House of Representatives to represent a primarily rural district bordering Iowa, South Dakota and Wisconsin. He served in Congress until 2019, when he became Minnesota's governor. He was reelected to the position in 2022.\n\nWalz faced intense criticism from Republicans during his first term as governor over his handling of the pandemic and the violent protests that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nWith Democrats controlling both chambers of the state legislature during his second term, Walz has enacted a number of progressive priorities, including the protection of abortion access and gender-affirming health care, legalizing recreational marijuana, restricting gun access, providing free school meals to all kids and expanding paid family leave.\n\nIf Harris and Walz win the White House, he would become the third vice president from Minnesota, after Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.", "source": {"uri":

But her pick is still unknown", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris will introduce her new running mate at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia -- but with the event mere hours away, her choice remains a mystery.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nKamala Harris readies a Philadelphia rally to introduce her running mate. But her pick is still unknown\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_weissert@chicagotribune.com", "name":

But her pick is still unknown", "body": "FILE - Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally, July 30, 2024, in Atlanta. Harris, the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, is poised to secure the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. (AP [...]\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris will introduce her new running mate at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia -- but with the event mere hours away, her choice remains a mystery.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated

The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of the running mate.\n\nAfter a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris must decide on her wingman before the two set off Tuesday on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the stakes of the election.\n\nEverything about her campaign has been rapid-fire out of necessity. She's been a candidate for only a little over two weeks, since President Joe Biden bowed out of the race following a dismal debate performance and escalating calls within the Democratic party for him to step aside. The Democratic National Committee chair said Friday that Harris had already secured enough votes to become the party's nominee and will accept the nomination Monday night when voting ends.\n\nAnd about 8 in 10 Democrats say they would be somewhat or very satisfied if Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted after Biden withdrew from the race.\n\nHarris has had to do condensed vetting of her potential running mates as the party's convention draws near. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nHarris was zeroing in on three running mate contenders, whom she interviewed Sunday in Washington. They were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to a person familiar with the process who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. Three other men have been in the mix: Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz is in his second term as governor of Minnesota. He has made his state a bastion of liberal policy and, this year, one of the few states to protect fans buying tickets online for Taylor Swift concerts and other live events. He comes from rural America and in his first race for Congress, Walz upset a Republican incumbent.\n\nHe was scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Minnesota later Monday, according to others who were familiar with the event who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the schedule that was not public.\n\nThe Minnesota Democratic Party, meanwhile, posted a booster for Walz online. \"IMPORTANT PSA: There's no 'T' sound in 'Walz' (But there is one in 'Vice President Walz'),\" the group wrote with a winking smiley face emoji.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed.\n\nShapiro has prominent supporters, too, like Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate. A person familiar with the mayor's thinking said she had no insider knowledge about Harris' intentions.\n\nWhen asked about the veepstakes Monday, Shapiro said he had no information.\n\n\"I got nothing for you, man,\" he told an Associated Press reporter as he arrived at the Pennsylvania state Capitol in Harrisburg. \"Have a great day.\"\n\nBoth Kelly and Shapiro have seen their detractors become more vocal as Harris closes in on a decision.\n\nSome labor groups have criticized Kelly, saying he opposes proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. The senator's office counters that while he did not co-sponsor the proposed legislation, he has said he would vote for it.\n\nThe nonprofit Institute for Middle East Understanding has been vocal about Shapiro, saying in a statement last week that he was not the right candidate for the job.\n\nShapiro has aggressively confronted what he views as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas as Israel battles the militants in Gaza. But he's also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while suggesting that any end to the Israel-Hamas war requires the removal of Hamas from power.\n\nHarris and her running mate -- whoever that is -- will launch Tuesday into an aggressive battleground state tour that begins in Philadelphia on Tuesday and winds later in the week through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. A scheduled stop in Savannah, Ga., was canceled due to the expected effects of Hurricane Debby.\n\nCampaign officials are aware that momentum can be fleeting and are working to capitalize on the energy now, while managing expectations by continuing to emphasize that the race with Republican nominee Donald Trump is tight. But the strong rollout has allowed the Harris campaign to put a number of states back in play that had been feared out of reach when Biden remained at the top of the ticket.\n\nTrump's running mate, JD Vance, was heading out on almost exactly the same campaign schedule as Harris: Philadelphia on Tuesday, Eau Claire, Wis., and Detroit on Wednesday and Raleigh, N.C., on Thursday.\n\nHe told Fox News on Sunday that Harris' pick doesn't matter to him. \"Whoever she chooses, the problem is going to be Kamala Harris' record and Kamala Harris' policies,\" he said, adding, \"It's not going to be good for the country.\"\n\nHarris' early rallies have attracted enthusiastic thousands. Campaign officials say each stop will be loaded with local election officials, religious leaders, union members and more in an effort to show the diversity of her coalition. Some Republicans will also appear with her, according to the campaign.\n\nThe campaign this week launched \"Republicans for Harris.\" The program will be a \"campaign within a campaign,\" according to Harris' team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Hannah Fingerhut, Steve Peoples and Mark Scolforo of The Associated Press.\n\nFILE - California State Attorney General Kamala Harris speaks to California Democrats, May 16, 2015, in Anaheim, Calif.

Who will stand at her side?", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris will introduce her new running mate at a Tuesday evening rally at Temple University. But with the event mere hours away, her choice isn't yet publicly known\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will introduce her new running mate at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia -- but with the event mere hours away, her choice remains a mystery.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as

Tim Walz as her running mate, AP sources say", "body": "Not a subscriber? Buy a Day Pass or just this story using our new Digital Wallet\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states, AP sources say.\n\nShe will introduce Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nSome Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris' VP pick\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.", "source":

But her pick is still unknown", "body": "Harris readies a Philadelphia rally to introduce her running mate. But her pick is still unknown\n\nWILL WEISSERT\n\nAugust 6, 2024 at 6:01 AM\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris will introduce her new running mate at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia -- but with the event mere hours away, her choice remains a mystery.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_weissert@aol.com", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author",

Tim Walz for Harris' VP", "body": "Sen. Bernie Sanders said he backed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Kamala Harris' VP pick. Walz is seen as a candidate who understands the working class and can rally rural voters. Labor leaders have also voiced support for Walz and applauded his support of the 2023 UAW strike.\n\nAmong the many men who could join Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, one person stands out to Sen. Bernie Sanders: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nThe democratic socialist, who endorsed Harris for president, told Minnesota Public Radio on Saturday that Walz would be a candidate who \"understands the needs of working families.\"\n\n\"I hope very much that the Vice President selects a running mate who will speak up and take on powerful corporate interests, and I think Tim Walz is somebody who could do that,\" Sanders said of Walz, a former teacher and rural Nebraska native.\n\nSanders isn't the first to point out Walz's potential to rally working-class voters. As Business Insider's John Dorman reported, Walz could help connect with rural and working-class voters who are unsure about voting blue.\n\nMultiple Minnesota labor leaders have voiced support for Walz in an open letter to Harris, calling him an \"essential partner in winning in November.\"\n\nWalz also received support from United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain, who pointed out on CNN Walz's support for the 2023 UAW strike, which ended in October. Walz joined the picket line at a striking Stellantis facility in Plymouth, Minnesota.\n\nThe Midwestern Democrat has also taken it upon himself to pit his rural roots against former President Donald Trump's VP pick, JD Vance, who is from Ohio.\n\n\"People like JD Vance know nothing about small-town America,\" Walz said during an appearance on \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nWalz is among several others being considered as a Harris running mate. Other contenders include Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, JB Pritzker of Illinois, and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, as well as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff predicted on Saturday that Harris' VP pick will be based on \"best running mate that will help her win.\"\n\n\"I think it's going to be less about who does she have the best chemistry with and more about who has the best chance of helping the ticket,\" he told CNN.\n\nHarris is expected to reveal her choice of running mate as early as Monday, sources told Reuters.\n\nThe Harris campaign told Politico that Harris would stage her first rally with her running mate in Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nRepresentatives for Walz, Sanders, and Harris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_getahun@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Hannah Getahun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plymouth, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Plymouth, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

But her pick is still unknown", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris will introduce her new running mate at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia -- but with the event mere hours away, her choice remains a mystery.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Here's who's in the running ahead of announcement", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris officially claimed the Democratic Presidential nomination Monday night, when the Democratic National Committee released final results of its virtual roll call. Next up: Choosing a running mate.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her pick for Vice President at some point Tuesday, ahead of a campaign rally event in Philadelphia Tuesday evening. From there, the vice president and her running mate will travel to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada for a series of rallies to drum up support ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro both met with Harris for one-on-one interviews Sunday according to NBC News, and are expected to be among the finalists to be on the presidential ticket this November, according to Reuters.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly also met with Harris on Sunday according to NBC News, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with her on Friday.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear have also been involved in the vetting process.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles or 600 kilometers of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed.\n\nShapiro has prominent supporters, too, like Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate. A person familiar with the mayor's thinking said she had no insider knowledge about Harris' intentions.\n\nWhen asked about the veepstakes Monday, Shapiro said he had no information.\n\n\"I got nothing for you, man,\" he told an Associated Press reporter as he arrived at the Pennsylvania state capitol in Harrisburg. \"Have a great day.\"\n\nBoth Kelly and Shapiro have seen their detractors become more vocal as Harris closes in on a decision.\n\nWalz is in his second term as governor of Minnesota. He has made his state a bastion of liberal policy and, this year, one of the few states to protect fans buying tickets online for Taylor Swift concerts and other live events. He comes from rural America and in his first race for Congress, Walz upset a Republican incumbent.\n\nTrump's running mate, JD Vance, told Fox News on Sunday that Harris' pick doesn't matter to him. \"Whoever she chooses, the problem is going to be Kamala Harris' record and Kamala Harris' policies,\" he said, adding \"it's not going to be good for the country.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago on Aug. 19. Harris' running mate is expected to address the convention on Aug. 21, with the vice president taking the stage on Aug. 22. President Biden is also expected to speak at the event.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@telegraphindia.com", "name":

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.\n\n- Hard fight -\n\nShapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the center than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nThis combination of file pictures created on July 31, 2024 shows (L-R, top to bottom) US Vice President and Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 23, 2024; and the five contenders being considered as her running mate Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on April 16, 2024; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear in Washington, DC, on April 26, 2023; Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in Washington, DC, on July 3, 2024; US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona in Washington, DC, on May 4, 2024; US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in Washington, DC, on April 17, 2024. The Harris Presidential Campaign team announced on July 30, 2024, that the vice president and her new running mate would campaign next week in battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer who exudes folksy charm, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as \"weird\" gaining enormous traction.\n\nOther less likely contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a longstanding friend of Harris; and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nHarris threw her hat in the ring and began her search for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden exited the race on July 21.\n\nHe had been facing mounting concerns over his low popularity ratings and advanced years, and Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presiding over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Harris's rise continuing unabated ever since, with a Morning Consult survey notably placing her four points ahead of Trump nationally, 48 to 44 percent.\n\nBut a new CBS News poll found Harris's popularity among Black voters some way behind Biden's score as he defeated Trump in 2020, prompting some senior Democrats to caution against complacency.\n\n\"She has a lot of momentum, but if you do look at the polling, this is still a really tight race,\" Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod told political outlet The Hill. \"This is going to be a hard fight for either side.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type":

Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were in the final three with Walz to run with Harris on November's Democratic ticket.\n\nKamala Harris has chosen Minnesota 's progressive governor Tim Walz as her running mate after weeks of speculation\n\nThe two are expected to be officially nominated as the president and vice presidential nominees at the Democratic National Convention Starting August 19 in Chicago.\n\nHarris earned enough support from delegates just two days after Biden announced he was ending his reelection bid.\n\nNow Walz will join Harris on Tuesday night for their first tandem campaign stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris and Walz will head to the six other swing states for a five-day campaign blitz this week through Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nAfter growing up in a small Nebraska town he started teaching.

Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nHarris wins Democratic nomination in virtual roll call. Here's how the process worked\n\nDemocratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nElections Trump is making his 2024 campaign about Harris' race, whether Republicans want him to or not By STEVE PEOPLES and MATT BROWN Associated Press\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\nGovernment-politics Civil Rights Movement Freedom Riders urge younger activists to get out the vote CHARLOTTE KRAMON Associated Press/Report for America\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nElections Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' race as he appears at gathering of Black journalists By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nElections Russia is relying on unwitting Americans to spread election disinformation, officials say DAVID KLEPPER Associated Press\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Progress"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zeke_miller@dailyprogress.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@dailyprogress.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Midwest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "zeke_miller@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "colleen_long@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Colleen Long", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "will_weissert@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Midwest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Associated Press reported. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and U.S. Secretary of Department of Transportation Pete Buttigieg were have also been involved in the vetting process.\n\nThe expected announcement comes less than three weeks ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, scheduled for Aug. 19 through 22. Harris' running mate is expected to address the convention on Aug. 21, with the vice president taking the stage on Aug. 22. President Biden is also expected to speak at the event.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro both met with Harris for one-on-one interviews Sunday according to NBC News, and are expected to be among the finalists to be on the presidential ticket this November, according to Reuters.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly also met with Harris on Sunday according to NBC News, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with her on Friday.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles or 600 kilometers of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed.\n\nShapiro has prominent supporters, too, like Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate. A person familiar with the mayor's thinking said she had no insider knowledge about Harris' intentions.\n\nWhen asked about the veepstakes Monday, Shapiro said he had no information.\n\n\"I got nothing for you, man,\" he told an Associated Press reporter as he arrived at the Pennsylvania state capitol in Harrisburg. \"Have a great day.\"\n\nBoth Kelly and Shapiro have seen their detractors become more vocal as Harris closes in on a decision.\n\nWalz is in his second term as governor of Minnesota. He has made his state a bastion of liberal policy and, this year, one of the few states to protect fans buying tickets online for Taylor Swift concerts and other live events. He comes from rural America and in his first race for Congress, Walz upset a Republican incumbent.\n\nTrump's running mate, JD Vance, told Fox News on Sunday that Harris' pick doesn't matter to him. \"Whoever she chooses, the problem is going to be Kamala Harris' record and Kamala Harris' policies,\" he said, adding \"it's not going to be good for the country.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago Monday, Aug. 19 at the United Center.

Tim Walz as running mate, Midwesterner known for union support and family aid", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nREAD MORE: Before Harris' VP pick, how Americans feel about possible running mates\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nREAD MORE: Rally venues and dates are set, the only thing missing for Harris' campaign blitz is her VP pick\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pbs.org", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "zeke_miller@pbs.org", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "will_weissert@pbs.org", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "colleen_long@pbs.org", "name": "Colleen Long", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@pbs.org", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Midwest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice-presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice-president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice-presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice-president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania - one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin - that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed - though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the Vice President moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counter-programming.\n\nThe Senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe Vice President's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \"uncommitted\" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Mr. Vance will also make a campaign stop in South Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Shapiro, 51, is a rising star of the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes makes it a must-win state for both Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump.\n\nA former state attorney general, Mr. Shapiro would add to the ticket's historical significance; he would be the country's first Jewish vice president, while Harris is seeking to become the first Black and South Asian American woman elected US president.\n\nMr. Shapiro's strong support for Israel could alienate some progressive voters, though it could also appeal to moderate voters and defang Republican efforts to turn the Israel-Gaza war into a wedge issue for Democrats.\n\nMr. Walz, 60, is a former US Army National Guard member and a former teacher who has raised his profile in recent weeks as an effective advocate for Ms. Harris. He has attacked Trump and Vance as \"weird,\" a viral insult the Harris campaign has embraced.\n\nA former member of Congress from a Republican-leaning district, Mr. Walz has proven appeal to rural, white voters, though he has also championed progressive policies as governor, such as free school meals and expanded paid worker leave. While Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, it is close to Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial battlegrounds.\n\nSpeculation had focused on six finalists - four governors, a senator and a cabinet secretary in the Biden administration, all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Walz, contenders included US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nThe candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, sources told Reuters. The Harris campaign plans a social media announcement featuring the duo, campaign officials familiar with the arrangements said.\n\nMs. Harris' search for a running mate began in earnest two weeks ago, shortly after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her to replace him.\n\nThere was no immediate indication that Monday's market selloff would have an impact on Harris' announcement timing. Mr. Trump, seeking to capitalize on the downturn, referred to the \"Kamala crash\" in a post on his social media site, Truth Social.\n\nOver the weekend, Harris met with her vetting team, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to multiple sources familiar with the process.\n\nMs. Harris is weighing the decision with her husband, Doug Emhoff, brother-in-law Tony West and a small circle of aides and advisers, the sources said.\n\nMs. Harris and her running mate will hit six cities: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThey will hold rallies in each location along the tour, which will include college campuses, historically Black universities, union halls and restaurants, a campaign official said.\n\nOver the weekend, the Harris campaign launched a program to persuade Republican voters to support the Democrat and showcased endorsements from Republicans including former Trump White House officials Stephanie Grisham and Olivia Troye.\n\nThe program - called Republicans for Harris - will hold kickoff events in the battleground states of Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania on Monday.\n\nOn Monday, Ms. Harris notched another union endorsement with the hospitality workers union praising her as having a longstanding record of delivering for union workers. - Reuters", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWorld"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That is all expected to end within hours.\n\nSeveral names have appeared in lists of potential vice presidential candidates, including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Other names have been floated -- including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who, like Harris, ran an unsuccessful campaign for president in 2020.\n\nCNN reported that Harris was set to meet with her \"vetting team\" on Saturday for briefings on the candidates, and that the final contenders would engage in meetings with the vice president.\n\nWith the announcement of her running mate expected on Tuesday, the pool was reportedly narrowed to just two candidates by Monday -- Josh Shapiro and Tim Walz.\n\nAccording to CPAC rankings, while Shapiro and Walz might come across as moderate, they are both extremely progressive. As The Daily Wire reported, Walz \"signed legislation giving illegal immigrants drivers licenses, and making the state a sanctuary state for child sex changes,\" and Shapiro funded sanctuary cities and promoted DEI in state government, among other things.\n\nFollowing the running mate announcement, Harris and her vice presidential candidate will reportedly hold a rally in Philadelphia, then go on a multi-state tour.\n\nThe two candidates rumored to be at the top of Harris' list, Shapiro and Walz, could boost Harris in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Minnesota. As of publication, former President Donald Trump is leading in Pennsylvania by 1.8% and Harris is leading in Minnesota by roughly 8% -- though only two recent polls appear in the RealClearPolitics average for Minnesota, so the data is less reliable.\n\nWalz has emerged late as a contender, with much of the early attention falling on Shapiro. Walz will face criticism for his role as Minnesota's governor during the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020 after the death of George Floyd -- the riots he allowed to envelop the city caused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property damage. Walz himself admitted that the government response was an \"abject failure,\" according to the local Star Tribune.\n\nWATCH BEN SHAPIRO'S 'SCAMALA: KAMALA HARRIS UNMASKED' ON DAILYWIRE+\n\nHarris has experienced a fairly significant polling bounce in the aftermath of Biden's departure, and appears to be gaining ground in states in which the president was lagging behind Trump. Her selection of a vice presidential candidate, as well as the excitement surrounding the Democratic National Convention later this month in Chicago, may well propel her further.\n\nHarris, however, is yet to sit for an interview -- or even answer a single question -- in the more than two weeks since she was elevated to the top of the ticket.\n\nThe announcement comes, also, as the Biden-Harris administration faces headwinds with crises both domestic and abroad. The stock market crashed on Monday, with the Dow Jones falling by more than 1,000 points, and the Middle East appears headed for full-scale conflict, with Iranian forces firing missiles on Monday at a U.S. military base in Iraq.\n\n\"ALL CAUSED BY INEPT U.S. LEADERSHIP!\" Trump posted to social media on Monday.\n\nHarris has also faced increased scrutiny on her personal life, with reports emerging over the weekend that her husband, Douglas Emhoff, impregnated the family nanny during his first marriage. He acknowledged the affair on Sunday, stating: \"I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side.\"", "source": {"uri":

But as of 4:30 p.m. Monday, Harris had yet to make her pick, the Washington Post reported, though earlier reports had indicated she had narrowed it to Shapiro and Walz.\n\nThe decision is expected to be among the most critical of Harris's campaign. Harris and Walz will square off against Republican Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, in November's general election. Vance is holding a campaign event Tuesday afternoon in South Philly.\n\nShapiro, 51, of Abington, Montgomery County, had the backing of Democrats in the Philadelphia region; the city's party endorsed him for the vice presidential nomination, and Mayor Cherelle Parker and U.S. Sen. Bob Casey had been among his outspoken advocates. The case for Shapiro centered on him being a political moderate with a high approval rating in a swing state. But Harris elected to go in a different direction.\n\nSome Democrats had voiced concerns about Shapiro's standing among progressive voters because of his position favoring private school vouchers -- traditionally thought of as a conservative policy -- and his staunch support for Israel in the face of calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has been outspoken about antisemitism and joined calls in the spring to dissolve a pro-Palestinian encampment outside the University of Pennsylvania. Critics have argued that Shapiro's views are a potential threat to free speech.\n\nShapiro also has been rebuked for the way his administration handled a sexual harassment scandal involving his top legislative liaison, Michael Vereb, who resigned weeks after a $295,000 settlement was reached with the woman who came forward against him.\n\nIn the days before the announcement, Sen. John Fetterman's aides reportedly had expressed his concerns about Shapiro to Harris, saying Shapiro was too focused on his personal ambitions. Some in the party's progressive wing, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) had pushed Harris to select Walz, a moderate expected to appeal to working-class voters.\n\nHer shortlist had included six white men who had demonstrated an ability to win over white, rural voters. In addition to Shaprio, Walz and Kelly, they included Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker.\n\nShapiro's steady rise in the Democratic party traces back more than two decades, when he held a series of roles on Capitol Hill while earning his law degree at Georgetown University. Shapiro returned to Abington in 2004 to run for state representative and won convincingly in a district that had long leaned Republican. He was then appointed to the newly created role of deputy speaker, cultivating a reputation as a bipartisan consensus builder in state government.\n\nAfter four terms in the House, Shapiro was elected to the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners in 2011 when the board flipped to Democratic control for the first time. He was then elected Pennsylvania Attorney General in 2016 and served two terms, spearheading investigations into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church and securing a $1 billion opioid settlement with drug distributors. In 2022, he defeated Republican Doug Mastriano to become Pennsylvania's governor.\n\nHarris and her running mate will spend the next week campaigning in several swing states, including Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona.

Tim Walz as running mate, aiming to add Midwest muscle to ticket", "body": "FILE - Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz listens after meeting with President Joe Biden, July 3, 2024, at the White House in Washington.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "colleen_long@eagletribune.com", "name": "Colleen Long", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "zeke_miller@eagletribune.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "will_weissert@eagletribune.com", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@eagletribune.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Midwest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Frontrunners revealed ahead of decision", "body": "All eyes are on Vice President Kamala Harris, who has secured the Democratic nomination for president, as she mulls her most important decision yet - picking her running mate.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her vice presidential selection on Tuesday, before a public appearance scheduled with that running mate in the evening.\n\nPotential names have been tossed around since President Joe Biden exited the 2024 race and endorsed Harris a couple of weeks ago.\n\nIt has not been clear if Harris already made her pick, but a handful of names have been identified as being on her shortlist.\n\nHarris has narrowed it down to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, three sources told Reuters on Monday.\n\nHere are the frontrunners for the position, which include four governors, a Biden administration cabinet secretary and a senator:\n\nShapiro, 51, serves as the governor of Pennsylvania, which is a critical swing state for Harris and ex-President and Republican nominee Trump with 19 electoral votes.\n\nIf elected, Shapiro would be the first Jewish vice president in American history. That would compliment Harris making history as the first black woman and Asian American president in the hypothetical win.\n\nShapiro has shown strong support for Israel, which could cost Harris votes from progressives backing Palestine. Meanwhile, it could also draw in moderate voters who may be leaning toward Trump.\n\nHarris kicking off the battleground states tour in Pennsylvania set off speculation that Shapiro could be her selection.\n\nWalz, 60, prior to serving governor of Minnesota was a US Army National Guard member and teacher.\n\nHe drew headlines recently by branding Trump and his vice presidential running mate, JD Vance, as 'weird'. The Harris campaign adopted the phrase and it went viral.\n\nWalz previously served in Congress representing a district that leaned Republican, meaning he may be able to carry white rural voters, a demographic that Trump traditionally did better with.\n\nMinnesota is a blue state, but it is close to the swing states of Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nSenator Mark Kelly, 60, of Arizona won two close races in the swing state. He has also shown an ability to be a top fundraiser.\n\nKelly on Sunday made a post on X (formerly Twitter) that suggested he was out of the shortlist.\n\n'My background is a bit different than most politicians. I spent my life serving in the Navy and at NASA, where the mission always comes first. Now, my mission is serving Arizonans,' he wrote on the social media platform.\n\nBut less than an hour later, Kelly deleted it and posted instead: 'Whether it was from my time in the Navy and at NASA, serving in the United States Senate, or visiting our troops overseas: I've learned that when your country asks you to serve, you always answer the call.'\n\nBiden's transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, 42, has had a quick ascent in politics, from mayor of the small city of South Bend, Indiana, to serving as a Cabinet member.\n\nAs transportation secretary since February 2021, Buttigieg has worked to increase safety on the road and address supply chain problems.\n\nButtigieg on Friday told ABC News' The View that he was 'flattered' to be mentioned as a running mate contender and that Harris is 'going to make the choice that is right for her, the ticket and the campaign, but most of all for the country'.\n\nHe pursued the 2020 Democratic nomination, debating against Harris and Biden.\n\nKentucky Governor Andy Beshear, 46, turned heads as headlined a Harris private campaign fundraiser in Chicago on Monday.\n\nHe recently raised money for Democrats in Georgia, Iowa and Oklahoma.\n\nAmong Democratic governors, Beshear has the highest approval rating at 67% among Kentucky voters, according to a Morning Consult poll released on July 24.\n\nHowever, Beshear was reportedly not one of three candidates who met with Harris for interviews in Washington, DC, on Sunday.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker, 59, won endorsements from union members, businesses and abortion rights organizations.\n\nPritzker reportedly had two virtual interviews with Harris' vetting team over the past week.\n\nHarris is expected to appear with her vice presidential pick at Temple University in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe campaign rally will reportedly spark momentum for a five-day tour of seven cities in battleground states.\n\nStops will be made at historically black universities, other college campuses, union halls and restaurants, according to a Harris campaign official.\n\nMORE : US presidential candidate posed with dead bear cub before dumping it in

Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Midwest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Point,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Point, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Point, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Tim Walz as her running mate, AP sources say", "body": "FILE - Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally, July 31, 2024, in Harrisburg, Pa. Trump's false attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris' Black identity have worried top Republicans that Trump may lose a campaign they still see as favorable for him. They say he should focus solely on the economy and immigration.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states, AP sources say.\n\nShe will introduce Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.", "source":

He has the potential to appeal to moderate, working-class and rural voters who could put Harris over the top in battleground states.\n\nBorn in rural Nebraska, he taught high school social studies and married a fellow teacher before entering politics, and also served in the National Guard. Despite his appeal as a moderate, he was the favourite among progressive Democrats to be Harris's running mate.\n\nIn recent weeks, Walz has emerged as a more prominent national political figure, especially in his attacks against Trump's vice-presidential nominee JD Vance.\n\nAfter a clip from 2021 went viral, in which Vance warned the US was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies\", citing Harris as an example, Walz became the face of the Democratic effort to paint Vance as \"weird\". His quotable soundbites flooded people's social media feeds.\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" Walz said in one MSNBC appearance. \"My God, they went after cat people -- good luck with that. Turn on the internet and see what cat people do when you go after 'em. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad,\" he said in another.\n\nBefore becoming governor of Minnesota, Walz served in the US House of Representatives, representing a largely rural district. His connection with rural voters in the Midwest could help peel them away from Trump in November.\n\nThe governor could also help defend Harris -- who was raised by academics in the San Francisco Bay Area -- against Republican accusations that she is a member of the coastal elite.\n\nThere has been a resurgence of enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket since Biden stepped aside. Harris has narrowed the polling gap with Trump nationally and in swing states, according to a Financial Times analysis. She has also raced ahead in the competition for donations.\n\nHarris was formally nominated in a virtual roll call on August 2, ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19. The party avoided a messy process to replace Biden by coalescing quickly around Harris in the days following the president's exit.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial

Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate against Donald Trump this November, multiple sources told The Associated Press and other news outlets.\n\nWalz is a former congressman who was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018.\n\nWalz led Minnesota through the COVID-19 pandemic -- including lockdowns, school shutdowns and business closures. He also led the state through the unrest that followed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. He made his support for abortion rights a centerpiece of his campaign in 2022.\n\nWalz's victory extended the Democratic Party's 12-year grip on the governor's office. The last time a Minnesota Republican won statewide office was in 2006, when Gov. Tim Pawlenty was reelected.\n\nWalz, a former high school football coach, found ways to work with the divided Minnesota Legislature during his first year as governor in 2019, but his relations with the Senate GOP majority deteriorated over how he used emergency powers to impose pandemic restrictions without legislative approval.\n\nWalz made his support for abortion rights a centerpiece of his campaign after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nAsked what set him apart from the other vice presidential contenders, Walz said he was excited about all of Harris' possible choices, but pointed to his work implementing federal policy as a governor.\n\n\"I'm not interviewing for anything. I just am who I am and put it out there,\" Walz said. \"I'm just going to say this, Yes, I'm a bit biased. I'm the chair of the Democratic Governors Association and Democratic governors have implemented the Biden-Harris administration in a way that has improved lives.\"\n\nIn addition to Walz, Harris was said to be considering Arizona U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is using virtual voting among delegates to complete the process of formally nominating Harris and her running mate, two weeks before the party's convention opens in Chicago. The vice president and her No. 2 now plan to head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Pawlenty", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Pawlenty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Josh Shapiro.\n\nWalz, 60, was somewhat of a dark horse candidate. His stock rose quickly after it appeared that Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) was no longer in contention. Walz has been one of Harris's key attack dogs since she became the presumptive nominee, and is credited with coming up with the insult \"weird\" to attack Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.\n\nHe may have also suggested that they both have cooties, too. Perhaps it didn't catch on.\n\nThough he doesn't hail from a swing state, Walz is believed to be able to appeal to voters in the Rust Belt while still being a solid leftist.\n\nIn fact, Sen. Bernie Sanders threw his support behind Walz last weekend.\n\n\"I hope very much that the Vice President selects a running mate who will speak up and take on powerful corporate interests, and I think Tim Walz is somebody who could do that,\" Sanders said on Minnesota Public Radio.\n\nGiven the circumstances, Harris's choice of Walz isn't as surprising as it might appear. With growing fears of a recession, this is a particularly risky time to be on the Democratic Party ticket. As a governor from a solid blue state, Walz has less to lose by running with Kamala.\n\nOn the other hand, Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party known for his moderate stances, risks damaging his political future in the state if Harris loses on a national ticket. Shapiro, who hails from the important swing state of Pennsylvania, has been the favored candidate for the past two weeks. However, many on the left were not convinced he was the best running mate for Harris for a variety of reasons. In addition to his being untested on the national stage, progressives weren't happy about his past position on school vouchers or his stance on the Israel-Hamas war. Shapiro also faces serious allegations by a fellow Democrat of covering up harassment in his office as well as being involved in the cover-up of a murder.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper (D-N.C.) took himself out of consideration last week because he wants to run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 -- a sign he doesn't think Kamala can win the election and doesn't want to be linked to her for that run.\n\nWalz's \"progressive\" bona fides are well established, and he is popular among the far-left Democrats in the House. For example, antisemitic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) was rooting for Walz.\n\n\"I want somebody who's really strongly pro-labor and understands labor, because this is a big part of the working-class agenda and making sure that we win working-class votes,\" Jayapal said.\n\n\"I want somebody who is totally committed to the agenda that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris fought for. ... And then I think it should be somebody who's really good in some of our Midwestern states. So making sure that we win Wisconsin, Ohio -- some of those places. And so that kind of brings me to -- I really like Gov. Walz,\" she continued. \"I like the things that he's been able to do. I like that he's from a rural town; I like that he's got a military background.\"", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_margolis@pjmedia.com", "name": "Matt Margolis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

A popular member of Congress, he reportedly had the backing of powerful former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in persuading Biden to leave the race.\n\nHarris and Walz will face Trump and his running mate JD Vance, also a military veteran from the Midwest, in a November 5 election.\n\nStumping for Harris, sometimes in a camouflage baseball hat and T-shirt, Walz has attacked Trump and Vance as \"weird,\" a catchy insult that has been picked up by the Harris campaign, social media and Democratic activists.\n\nWalz gave the nascent Harris campaign the new attack line in a late July interview: \"These are weird people on the other side: They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\" referring to book bans and women's reproductive consultations with doctors.\n\nWalz has also attacked the claims by Trump and Vance of having middle class credentials.\n\n\"They keep talking about the middle class. A robber baron real estate guy and a venture capitalist trying to tell us they understand who we are? They don't know who we are,\" Walz said in an MSNBC interview.\n\nThat approach has struck a chord with the young voters Harris needs to reengage. David Hogg, the co-founder of the gun safety group March for Our Lives, described him as a \"great communicator.\"\n\nWalz is \"somewhat of a unicorn,\" said Ryan Dawkins, a political science professor at Minnesota's Carleton College - a man born in a small town in rural Nebraska capable of conveying Harris' message to core Democratic voters, and those that the party has failed to reach in recent years.\n\nDawkins praised his ability to connect with rural voters. It is a group the Biden administration has tried to reach with infrastructure spending and other pragmatic policies, but with little show of messaging success so far.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Trump won 59% of rural voters; in 2020 that number rose to 65% even though Trump lost the election, according to Pew Research.\n\nIn the 2022 governor's race, Walz won with 52.27% to his Republican opponent's 44.61%, although swaths of rural Minnesota voted for the opponent.\n\nWhile Walz has supported Democratic Party orthodoxy on issues ranging from legalized abortion and same-sex marriage to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, he also racked up a centrist voting record during his congressional career.\n\nHe was a staunch defender of government support for farmers and military veterans, as well as gun-owner rights that won praise from the National Rifle Association, according to The Almanac of American Politics.\n\nHe subsequently registered a failing grade with the NRA after supporting gun-control measures during his first campaign for governor.\n\nWalz's shift from a centrist representing a single rural district in Congress to a more progressive politician as governor may have been in response to the demands of voters in major cities like Minneapolis-St. Paul. But it leaves him open to Republican attacks, Dawkins said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"He runs the risk of reinforcing some of the worst fears people have of Kamala Harris being a San Francisco liberal,\" Dawkins said.\n\nWalz has a ready counter-attack.\n\n\"What a monster. Kids are eating and having full bellies, so they can go learn and women are making their own healthcare decisions,\" Walz said in a July CNN interview. \"So if that's where they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label.\"\n\nAs the state's top executive, Walz mandated the use of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic and signed a law making marital rape illegal. He presided over several years of budget surpluses in Minnesota on the road to his 2022 reelection.\n\nDuring that campaign, Walz touted the backing of several influential labor unions, including the state AFL-CIO, firefighters, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), teachers and others.\n\nHis tenure was marked by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murder. Walz assigned the state's attorney general to lead the prosecution in the case, saying people \"don't believe justice can be served.\" - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType":

The 60-year-old father-of-two, who has been married to his teacher wife Gwen since 1994, joins the ticket in a victory for the progressive left of the party who were concerned about some of the other contenders' support of Israel.\n\nIn Minnesota he has codified the right to abortion, signed universal free school meals, legalized recreational marijuana and gave voting rights to former prisoners. The former teacher is also credited with being the Democrat who started calling Republicans 'weird', a craze that has dominated the campaign since Joe Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nWalz turned Minnesota state into a refuge for LGBTQ Americans and has also backed making the North Star State the 13th 'sanctuary' state for undocumented migrants. Harris announced her decision after a hotly-watched veepstakes in the two weeks after taking over Biden 's campaign.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were in the final three with Walz to run with Harris on November's Democratic ticket. Now Walz will join Harris on Tuesday night for their first tandem campaign stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The two will then head to the six other swing states for a five-day campaign blitz this week through Georgia, Michigan , Wisconsin, North Carolina , Nevada and Arizona. After growing up in a small Nebraska town he started teaching. First he went to China and then moved to classrooms in Nebraska and Minnesota.\n\nIn Makato he taught geography and was the first faculty adviser for the school's first gay-straight alliance, set up in 1999. He also coached the school's football team. Walz and his wife Gwen have two children together - Hope, who recently graduated from college in Montana, and Gus, who is in public high school in St. Paul, Minnesota. He doesn't drink alcohol or coffee, he is a huge fan of Diet Mountain Dew and was arrested for DWI in Nebraska in 1995, before he quit drinking.\n\nTheir children were conceived by IVF and fertility treatments, a side of his story that can be used to attack Republicans on reproductive rights. According to the Star Tribune , Walz rides in the passenger seat on official duties because he gets carsick in the back. He is also a runner, served in the Army National Guard and has hundreds of challenge coins he has collected in his office. Walz became governor of Minnesota in 2019 after serving six terms in the House of Representatives for the state's 1st congressional district, which encompasses its entire southern border.\n\nHe served as Democratic ranking member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for his final term before taking residence in the Minnesota Governor's Mansion in Saint Paul. Along with Shapiro and Kelly, there was a slew of speculation about others being considered for Harris' VP pick, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. On Monday afternoon, reporting emerged that Harris narrowed her decision to Shapiro and Walz. Some thought picking a running mate from a swing state would benefit Harris - like Shapiro from Pennsylvania or Arizona's Sen. Kelly.\n\nAlong with Shapiro and Kelly, there was a slew of speculation about others being considered for Harris' VP pick, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. But Walz's state of Minnesota is already solidly blue and voted for the Democratic candidates in 2016 and 2020.\n\nMinnesota voted for Hillary Clinton 1.5 percent over Donald Trump and four years later widened the blue to red ratio by voting 7.1 percent for Biden over the former president. The state is considered to be a 'lean Democrat' for the 2024 election, according to Cook Political Report. On Monday afternoon, reporting emerged that Harris narrowed her decision to Shapiro and Walz.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nAll of the short list candidates were white men from the Midwest or other battleground states, highlighting the perceived need to balance the ticket led by Harris, who is vying to become the first Black woman president.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.\n\n- Hard fight -\n\nShapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the center than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer who exudes folksy charm, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as \"weird\" gaining enormous traction.\n\nOther less likely contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a longstanding friend of Harris; and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nHarris threw her hat in the ring and began her search for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden exited the race on July 21.\n\nHe had been facing mounting concerns over his low popularity ratings and advanced years, and Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presiding over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Harris's rise continuing unabated ever since, with a Morning Consult survey notably placing her four points ahead of Trump nationally, 48 to 44 percent.\n\nBut a new CBS News poll found Harris's popularity among Black voters some way behind Biden's score as he defeated Trump in 2020, prompting some senior Democrats to caution against complacency.\n\n\"She has a lot of momentum, but if you do look at the polling, this is still a really tight race,\" Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod told political outlet The Hill. \"This is going to be a hard fight for either side.\"\n\nft/jgc/mlm", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frankie_taggart@ccenterdispatch.com",

He joined the publication in 2021 on the crime beat.\n\nKamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her 2024 running mate, according to multiple reports, rounding out the new Democratic White House ticket.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, Harris had not formally announced her decision.\n\nWalz, 60, joined a rumored shortlist of vice presidential picks even before President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, as Democratic power brokers pondered what a strong, alternate ticket might look like.\n\nOther VP potentials who caught Harris' eye included Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Walz was initially a dark horse in the group, whose headline-generating media circuit quickly made him a serious contender.\n\nHarris had final interviews with her top running mate choices in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, which sealed the deal for Walz. The two will now hit the campaign trail together for a five-day tour of seven battleground states, beginning with a stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening.\n\nWalz is a former teacher, national guardsman and high school football coach who turned to politics in 2006 when he successfully ran for U.S. Congress as a Democrat in a historically Republican district. After 12 years in the House, during which he became a senior member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Walz soundly won the 2018 Minnesota gubernatorial race.\n\nSince his reelection, the governor has adopted a platform that aligns with a significant portion of the Biden-Harris administration. He's signed legislation into law that protected Minnesotans' access to abortion, legalized marijuana and addressed calls for police reform. A father of two, he has been open about his family's experience with IVF.\n\nThough Walz was once given an \"A\" rating by the NRA, he shifted his views on the organization after a series of mass shootings. Following the Las Vegas concert shooting in 2017, he donated the amount of all the money he'd received from the NRA to an organization that supports families of fallen soldiers. After the Parkland, Fla., school shooting in 2018, he wrote a Star Tribune op-ed about his evolving mindset. He has since helped shepherd gun safety legislation in Minnesota.\n\nWalz stands out as an experienced politician with surprising Gen Z appeal who could help Harris better speak to Midwest voters in the quest to lock down 270 Electoral College votes. Already on the campaign trail, he helped the Harris campaign find its voice by branding far-right Republican policies as \"weird\" -- a term that immediately stuck -- and in recent media appearances, he's been able to articulate a sharp ideological divide between J.D. Vance and rural Americans.\n\nBiden, 81, made the last-minute decision on July 21 to abandon his reelection campaign amid mounting pressure from Democrats, who feared that he was not a strong enough candidate to defeat Donald Trump after seeing his performance in the first presidential debate.\n\nThe president promptly endorsed Harris to replace him on the ticket, creating a rapid trickle effect of Democratic lawmakers and delegates who determined that the most unifying path forward was to stand with Harris.\n\nThough other candidates could have jumped in and challenged Harris for the nomination, no major players decided to, clearing the way for Harris to become the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,\" Harris said after entering the presidential race. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nElections Trump is making his 2024 campaign about Harris' race, whether Republicans want him to or not By STEVE PEOPLES and MATT BROWN Associated Press\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\nElections Civil Rights Movement Freedom Riders urge younger activists to get out the vote CHARLOTTE KRAMON Associated Press/Report for America\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen.

Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nElections Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' race as he appears at gathering of Black journalists By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nElections Russia is relying on unwitting Americans to spread election disinformation, officials say DAVID KLEPPER Associated Press\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on

Harris will reveal her choice in a video announcement before she and her running mate appear together for a rally in Philadelphia to kick off a five-day tour.\n\nPolitico, which first reported about the video announcement, said President Joe Biden had also prepared a video to announce Harris as his running mate back in 2020.\n\nHarris interviewed several contenders. Governors Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Tim Walz of Minnesota and Arizona senator Mark Kelly were interviewed over the weekend at the Naval Observatory, the Washington DC residence of the vice-president.\n\nShe also interviewed governors J.B. Pritzker and Andy Beshear, and the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, who now is the US Secretary of Transportation.\n\nReuters' sources suggested Harris may have shortlisted Walz and Shapiro for the final lap.\n\nFollowing a report that Harris had made her pick, her campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz wrote on X that she was still deciding.\n\n\"We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!\"\n\nHarris' choice of a running mate is seen as one of the most consequential decisions of her political career, as she pulls together a campaign to challenge Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and US Senator JD Vance, his vice presidential pick.\n\nShapiro is a former state attorney general. According to Reuters, his selection would be a historical moment as, in the event of a win, he would be the first Jewish Vice-President. While Shapiro's strong support for Israel could alienate progressive voters, it could appeal to moderates and neutralise Republican efforts to use the Israel-Gaza conflict as a wedge issue against the Democrats.\n\nWalz is more popular with young and progressive voters than Kelly or Shapiro, The Guardian reported. He is a former US Army National Guard member and a former teacher who has raised his profile in recent weeks as an effective advocate for Harris.

Walz's blend of progressive policies and rural appeal, coupled with his military background, makes him a strategic choice. The Harris campaign highlights his bipartisan appeal and effective communication style.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, choosing a progressive policy champion and a plain speaker from America's heartland to help win over rural, white voters, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old U.S. Army National Guard veteran and former teacher, was elected to a Republican-leaning district in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006 and served 12 years before being elected governor of Minnesota in 2018. As governor, Walz has pushed a progressive agenda that includes free school meals, goals for tackling climate change, tax cuts for the middle class and expanded paid leave for Minnesota workers.\n\nWalz has long advocated for women's reproductive rights but also displayed a conservative bent while representing a rural district in the U.S. House, defending agricultural interests and backing gun rights. Harris, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, is adding a popular Midwestern politician whose home state votes reliably for Democrats in presidential elections but is close to Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial battlegrounds.\n\nSuch states are seen as crucial in deciding this year's election, and Walz is widely seen as skilled at connecting with white, rural voters who in recent years have voted broadly for the Republican Donald Trump, Harris' rival for the White House. The Harris campaign hopes Walz's extensive National Guard career, coupled with a successful run as a high school football coach, and his Dad joke videos will attract such voters who are not yet dedicated to a second Trump term in the White House.\n\nHarris, 59, has revived the Democratic Party's hopes of an election victory since becoming its candidate after President Joe Biden, 81, ended his failing reelection bid under party pressure on July 21. Walz was a relative unknown nationally until the Harris \"veepstakes\" heated up, but his profile has since surged. A popular member of Congress, he reportedly had the backing of powerful former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in persuading Biden to leave the race.\n\nHarris and Walz will face Trump and his running mate JD Vance, also a military veteran from the Midwest, in a Nov. 5 election. Stumping for Harris, sometimes in a camouflage baseball hat and T-shirt, Walz has attacked Trump and Vance as \"weird,\" a catchy insult that has been picked up by the Harris campaign, social media and Democratic activists.\n\nA 'UNICORN' Walz gave the nascent Harris campaign the new attack line in a late July interview: \"These are weird people on the other side: They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\" referring to book bans and women's reproductive consultations with doctors.\n\nWalz has also attacked the claims by Trump and Vance of having middle class credentials. \"They keep talking about the middle class. A robber baron real estate guy and a venture capitalist trying to tell us they understand who we are? They don't know who we are,\" Walz said in an MSNBC interview.\n\nThat approach has struck a chord with the young voters Harris needs to reengage. David Hogg, the co-founder of the gun safety group March for Our Lives, described him as a \"great communicator.\" Walz is \"somewhat of a unicorn,\" said Ryan Dawkins, a political science professor at Minnesota's Carleton College - a man born in a small town in rural Nebraska capable of conveying Harris' message to core Democratic voters, and those that the party has failed to reach in recent years.\n\nDawkins praised his ability to connect with rural voters. It is a group the Biden administration has tried to reach with infrastructure spending and other pragmatic policies, but with little show of messaging success so far. In the 2016 election, Trump won 59% of rural voters; in 2020 that number rose to 65% even though Trump lost the election, according to Pew Research.\n\nIn the 2022 governor's race, Walz won with 52.27% to his Republican opponent's 44.61%, although swaths of rural Minnesota voted for the opponent. While Walz has supported Democratic Party orthodoxy on issues ranging from legalized abortion and same-sex marriage to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, he also racked up a centrist voting record during his congressional career.\n\nHe was a staunch defender of government support for farmers and military veterans, as well as gun-owner rights that won praise from the National Rifle Association, according to The Almanac of American Politics. He subsequently registered a failing grade with the NRA after supporting gun-control measures during his first campaign for governor.\n\nWalz's shift from a centrist representing a single rural district in Congress to a more progressive politician as governor may have been in response to the demands of voters in major cities like Minneapolis-St. Paul. But it leaves him open to Republican attacks, Dawkins said in a telephone interview. \"He runs the risk of reinforcing some of the worst fears people have of Kamala Harris being a San Francisco liberal,\" Dawkins said.\n\nWalz has a ready counter-attack. \"What a monster. Kids are eating and having full bellies, so they can go learn and women are making their own healthcare decisions,\" Walz said in a July CNN interview. \"So if that's where they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label.\"\n\nAs the state's top executive, Walz mandated the use of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic and signed a law making marital rape illegal. He presided over several years of budget surpluses in Minnesota on the road to his 2022 reelection. During that campaign, Walz touted the backing of several influential labor unions, including the state AFL-CIO, firefighters, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), teachers and others.\n\nHis tenure was marked by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murder. Walz assigned the state's attorney general to lead the prosecution in the case, saying people \"don't believe justice can be served.\"", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but decisions beyond that aren't yet publicly known.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wgntv.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nWashington, Aug 6 (AP) Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nAlso Read | 'Hindus Are Very Afraid': Bangladesh ISKCON General Secretary Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari Seek's India's Help Amid Unrest (Watch Video).\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nAlso Read | Hiroshima, Nagasaki Atomic Bombings: Lok Sabha Pays Tributes to Victims of Nuclear Bomb Attack in Japanese Cities in August 1945.\n\nThe three people spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid preempting the official announcenment later Tuesday.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labelling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" US Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said on Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labour Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled\".\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping USD 17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programmes that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of USD 250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticise Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.

As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to announce her running mate, a new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that several of the top potential contenders for the role are largely unknown to voters.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked. The people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been announced\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will be yet another milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tim Walz as running mate, aiming to add Midwest muscle to ticket", "body": "U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, right, and Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz / AFP-Yonhap\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz awaits the arrival of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, March 14. AFP-Yonhap\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said, \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, right, speaks with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz before boarding Marine One in Minnesota, in this November 2023 photo. AFP-Yonhap\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.

PAUL, Minn. (FOX 9) - Vice President Kamala Harris has picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election, according to Associated Press sources.\n\nHarris is expected to make the announcement official on Tuesday.\n\nHarris is scheduled to tour battleground states next week with Walz.\n\nOther names on the shortlist for VP included Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, as well as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.\n\nIn the weeks since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race for president, Walz has been campaigning for Harris as the Democratic nominee and next president -- and drawing a lot of attention while doing it despite not having much of a national profile.\n\nIn the hours after Biden dropped out, Walz was on the phone with Harris. He wouldn't quite say what the conversation was about but he enthusiastically praised the vice president, especially for her groundbreaking appearance in St. Paul when she became the first sitting VP or President to visit an abortion clinic.\n\nThe second-term DFL governor was seen as a dark horse early on but got a boost from social media and has created excitement after a series of appearances on national networks, including FOX News.\n\nWalz drew support from Democrats while making headlines and going viral for his comments, including starting the Harris campaign's \"weird\" attack line against former President Donald Trump and JD Vance. Those who support him have cited his experience passing liberal priorities in Minnesota, as well as his background as a teacher, coach and veteran of the National Guard.\n\nEven before Biden dropped out, some in Minnesota's Congressional Delegation said Walz would make a great vice president, including U.S. Sen. Tina Smith (she hasn't yet endorsed Walz for VP) and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum.\n\nHe's also drawn fire from Minnesota Republicans and Trump after being named to a \"short list\" for potential vice presidential candidates.\n\nIn an ABC News/Ipsos poll before Harris announced her running mate, found that about 9 in 10 U.S. adults don't know enough to have an opinion on Walz. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative.\n\nWalz was elected as Minnesota's 41st governor in 2018 and was reelected in 2022. His accomplishments include providing free school meals to all students in Minnesota, protecting reproductive freedom, cutting taxes for the middle class, and expanding paid leave for workers, among other priorities.\n\nIn addition to being the governor, he is also the co-chair of the Democratic Convention Rules Committee.\n\nHe was born in Nebraska, and after high school, he enlisted in the Army National Guard. He graduated from Chadron State College with a social science degree in 1989. He then spent a year teaching abroad before returning home to serve full-time in the National Guard and teach high school, as well as accept a coaching position.\n\nWalz is married to Gwen Walz. They moved to Mankato, Minnesota, where they both worked at Mankato High School, where he taught social studies and helped coach the Mankato West football team.\n\nHe was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, representing Minnesota's First Congressional District, and was reelected for another five terms before running for governor of Minnesota.\n\nIf Harris and Walz are elected president and vice president, it sets off a chain of promotions in Minnesota, making Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan Minnesota's first female and first Native American governor, and state Sen. Bobby Jo Champion its first Black lieutenant governor.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 Atlanta"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz as running mate as she looks to boost Democratic ticket in Midwest, AP sources say.\n\nIn recent days, she had zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will be yet another milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.", "source": {"uri": "wishtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WISH-TV | Indianapolis News | Indiana Weather | Indiana Traffic"},

Tim Walz for running mate", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate, according to three sources with knowledge of the pick, adding a popular Midwestern state executive to the Democratic ticket as the party gears up to hold onto key Northern battleground states this fall.\n\nIn picking Walz, who's in his second term and also served 12 years in Congress, Harris will have as her No. 2 someone with a proven record of winning over white working-class voters in Rust Belt states while also boasting a robustly progressive record.\n\nDemocrats will hope that mix of attributes helps a Harris-Walz ticket shore up support in the onetime \"blue wall\" states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- longtime Democratic strongholds at the presidential level that Donald Trump flipped in 2016 and Joe Biden flipped back in 2020. This year, they've been seen as Biden's, and now Harris', most viable path to victory.\n\nWalz, 60, had initially been viewed as a long shot in a field of vice presidential contenders that included rising party stars, some of whom have been mentioned as future presidential candidates, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nNow Harris has chosen a governing partner who has leaned in at times to a folksy, Midwestern reputation while also proving to be a reliable attack dog against Trump.\n\nWalz's experiences earlier in his life, as a public school teacher and a member of the Army National Guard, could also buttress his ability to speak to different voting blocs -- including veterans and organized labor -- that Harris will need to win in November.\n\nWalz, a Nebraska native, enlisted in the National Guard when he was 17 and served for more than two decades, with both domestic and overseas deployments. He later was a high school social studies teacher and football coach in Mankato, about 80 miles south of Minneapolis, before he won a congressional seat in a largely rural and agricultural district in 2006.\n\nHe represented Minnesota's 1st District for 12 years before his successful run for governor in 2018. A 1995 reckless driving arrest in Nebraska, during which, an officer said, Walz had failed a sobriety test, came up in his campaigns for House and the governorship, but he was elected anyway. Walz called it a \"gut check moment\" in an interview with the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2018, saying he stopped drinking afterward.\n\nWalz's allies have spoken frequently about how his background representing rural communities is much needed in the party, noting that he won re-election in a red-trending district -- one that was about evenly divided in 2012 but swung heavily to Trump in 2016 -- and could help Democrats compete for some moderate or conservative voters skeptical of Trump this time around.\n\nWalz also had the most Capitol Hill experience of anyone on Harris' reported short list, with relationships in Congress that could help a new president move a legislative agenda.\n\nAs governor, Walz has overseen a bonanza of progressive policy accomplishments -- particularly during his second term, during which Democrats have also controlled both chambers of the Legislature.\n\nHe has signed laws protecting abortion rights, legalizing recreational marijuana, restricting gun access and providing legal refuge to trans youths whose access to gender-affirming and other medical care has been restricted elsewhere. Progressives elsewhere have pointed to Minnesota as a case study in how to effectively use the power of a legislative trifecta to achieve policy priorities.\n\nWalz also enacted laws expanding paid family leave, banning most non-compete agreements, providing universal school meals for students and capping the price of insulin in Minnesota (three years before Biden did it nationally) -- a list of legislative wins his colleagues and supporters have said would translate nationally.\n\nWalz doesn't have the same degree of name recognition as many of his presumed competitors to be Harris' running mate, though he spent a year leading fundraising efforts for Democratic governors as chair of the Democratic Governors Association. In recent days, Walz has turned up the publicity dial, trying out attack lines against Trump and Sen. JD Vance in a slew of media appearances.\n\nIn a late July interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" he ripped Trump and Vance as \"weird,\" gaining wider notice. Harris herself began using the \"weird\" line almost immediately.\n\nWalz also explicitly used his media appearances to attack the GOP ticket by playing up his strong cultural ties to the middle of the country -- and to demonstrate to Democrats how he would intend for the party to win over those voters.\n\n\"What I know is that people like JD Vance know nothing about small town America,\" Walz said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on July 23. \"My town had 400 people, 24 kids in my graduating class, 12 were cousins. And he gets it all wrong.\"\n\n\"It's not about hate. It's not about collapsing in. The golden rule there is mind your own damn business,\" Walz said, adding that Republican \"policies are what destroyed rural America. They divided us. They're in our exam rooms. They're telling us what books to read.\"\n\n\"And what I think what Kamala Harris knows is bringing people together around the shared values, strong public schools, strong labor unions that create the middle class, health care that's affordable and accessible, those are the things,\" Walz said.\n\nPicking Walz doesn't come without risks. While his selection underscores Democrats' effort to aggressively go after Midwestern voters, he doesn't bring a specific battleground state advantage: Minnesota hasn't gone red in a presidential race since 1972.\n\nIn addition, as Walz's stock has risen in recent days, critics have reintroduced questions about his governing record. They include concerns over a delay calling in the National Guard as protests engulfed Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd by city police officers in May 2020, as well as the fact that the biggest pandemic fraud case in the U.S. happened under his watch.\n\nAnother presumed liability for Walz's VP chances early on had been his role as a co-chair of the Democratic National Convention rules committee -- a job that, in the chaotic days after Biden dropped out of the race, led him to help Harris quickly become the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nAny potential criticism over a conflict of interest was largely rendered moot when precisely zero high-profile competitors challenged Harris for the nomination.\n\nWalz told reporters that \"anybody [who] wants to put their name in\" to be nominated\" can do so.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type":

The US is still guessing who will make the final decision.\n\nThe choice will then be formally unveiled at a Harris meeting in Philadelphia on Tuesday afternoon. The Secret Service is ready for both candidates to be chosen.\n\nThe end of Harris' vice presidential search comes as the Middle East teeters on the brink after a base housing U.S. troops in Iraq was hit by a missile attack and as Iran prepares to attack Israel.\n\nFollow all the developments via DailyMail.com's American politics blog.\n\nJD Vance follows Harris this week\n\nBy Emily Goodin, Senior White House Correspondent\n\nKamala Harris and JD Vance could run into each other on an airport tarmac this week, as they're both campaigning in the same swing states on the same day.\n\nHarris and her running mate are planning a tour of several key states where the election is still uncertain, with Donald Trump's running mate Vance hot on their heels.\n\nThe Republican senator from Ohio will campaign in Philadelphia hours before Harris holds a rally at Temple University -- her first meeting with her vice presidential candidate.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris and Vance will both be in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and then they will both head to Michigan: Harris in Detroit and Vance in Shelby Township, a suburb of Detroit.\n\nOn Thursday, Harris and Vance are both in North Carolina's Research Triangle.\n\n\"We are pleased that JD Vance is offering voters in swing states exactly the split screen that will define their choice this November: a ticket focused on building an America of opportunity, lower costs and more freedom - or an America modeled on the Trump-Vance Project 2025 agenda of extremism, less freedom and an economy that benefits only billionaires and big business,\" Charles Lutvak, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, told DailyMail.com.\n\nVoters favor Harris VP pick who may no longer be in the race\n\nBy Katelyn Caralle, Senior U.S. Political Reporter\n\nSen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has the highest popularity rating of the running mate candidates for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut as of Tuesday morning, it appears the Democratic lawmaker is no longer eligible to join Harris.\n\nThe top two appear to be Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\nAnd this is a pattern that is occurring among most of the candidates Harris is considering as her running mate.\n\nTwenty-five percent of Americans have a positive view of Shapiro, 23 percent are negative, and 53 percent have either never heard of the governor or have no opinion of him.\n\nBiden's Quiet Day\n\nBy Emily Goodin, Senior White House Correspondent\n\nPresident Joe Biden has no public events scheduled for Tuesday, the day Kamala Harris is expected to name her running mate.\n\nThe only item on Biden's schedule is his daily presidential briefing at 2:15 p.m. The schedule is not indicative of all of his activities. Many phone calls and meetings are not listed.\n\nBiden returned to the White House Monday afternoon after a long weekend in Wilmington, Delaware. He went straight to the Situation Room for an update on the situation in the Middle East.\n\nHarris was present at his briefing.\n\nDay 16 of VP Harris Avoiding Answering the Press\n\nBy Katelyn Caralle, Senior U.S. Political Reporter\n\nIt's been 16 days since Kamala Harris entered the 2024 race and she still hasn't held a press conference.\n\nThe vice president has also not given any interviews or answered any questions from the media since President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign last month.\n\nAlthough Harris has been busy campaigning over the past two weeks since announcing her candidacy, she has managed to avoid the press.\n\nIt's unclear how long Harris can last, but some people online are already asking questions, wondering out loud how the vice president will handle \"unforeseen moments\" as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nTrump V Kamala is up next as Harris secures the Democratic presidential nomination, with a new poll revealing her ahead by 48 points to 44.\n\nDeputy Director Kamala Harris has officially secured the Democratic presidential nomination, with a new poll showing her with a four-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump as the two prepare for a battle.\n\nHarris is ahead at 48% and former President Trump is at 44%, according to a survey of 11,265 voters conducted by Morning Consult between August 2 and 4.\n\nThe company described it as a \"record-high margin in its favor\" and the \"largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year.\"\n\nThe latest poll shows a possible narrow gap between the Democratic and Republican nominees. An earlier poll suggested a neck-and-neck race between the two.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll from over the weekend found Harris leading Trump nationally, 50 percent to 49 percent among likely voters. In the swing states, they were tied at 50 percent.\n\nNow that Harris has secured the nomination, she will announce her choice for vice president. According to commentators, the choice will be limited to Governor Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Governor Walz of Minnesota.\n\nKamala Harris' running mate decision hinges on final moments\n\nBy Katelyn Caralle, Senior US Political Reporter and Emily Goodin, Senior White House Correspondent\n\nKamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate today, though she had not made a final decision as of Monday evening.\n\nA source familiar with the vice-presidential selection process told DailyMail.com as the decision comes at the last minute:\n\nHarris had not made a final decision last night, as she wanted to sleep on it. Today she will call the finalists to inform them of her choice.\n\nHer team has printed multiple versions of campaign signs for tonight's rally, with her name next to the top candidates, so they'll be ready no matter who is elected.\n\nSpeculation continues that Harris will select Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after narrowing her choices to him and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nThe vice president is preparing to appear with her candidate at a rally in Philadelphia later Tuesday night, kicking off a five-day, seven-state campaign that will play out in the 2024 battleground.\n\nIn addition to Walz and Shapiro, others on Harris' shortlist include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nMost establishment Democrats still appear to favor Shapiro, saying he gives the party a better chance of winning the swing state of Pennsylvania.\n\nA Democratic strategist told Politico:\n\nWe were seven months behind, so where we are now feels like we're winning. But we're tied again, we're not winning. And a point in Pennsylvania is worth a hundred points, because in a 50-50 race, it's everything.\n\nAfter she announces her running mate, the duo will have less than two weeks to campaign together before the Democratic National Convention this month, where Harris and her pick are expected to become the party's presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\nMontana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester accused of 'covering up' Biden's decline in brazen ad launched in swing state\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jon Tester lied about Joe Biden's ability to do the job of president. That's the brazen message of a new attack ad in Montana, a high-stakes race where both sides know a victory in November could mean control of the Senate.\n\nThe 30-second commercial, produced by More Jobs, Less Government, a super PAC backing Republican opponent Tim Sheehy, airs Tuesday.\n\nIt starts with Democrat Tester's own words.\n\n\"Joe Biden, when I'm around him, and it's not every day ... he's absolutely 100 percent there,\" he says in the ad produced by More Jobs, Less Government, a super PAC backing his Republican opponent Tim Sheehy.\n\n\"That wasn't true,\" the narrator says. \"Tester lied.\"", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person",

Since then, she has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and recast the race against Republican Donald Trump with a boost of energy from her party's base.\n\nAlthough she had gathered enough delegates to be her party's nominee, the Democratic National Committee said late on Monday that she had officially secured the nomination.\n\nHarris is expected to appear with her running mate at an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening. Her selection will demonstrate her thinking about her best pathway to winning the presidency and show who she believes would serve as an effective governing partner should she prevail against Trump.\n\nShapiro, 51, is a rising star in the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes make it a must-win state for both Harris and Trump.\n\nWalz, 60, serves as governor in a solidly Democratic state but has proven appeal to rural, white voters, who in recent years have voted broadly for Trump.\n\nAmericans typically focus on the person at the top of the ticket when choosing whom to vote for, but vice presidential candidates can help or hurt their running mates based on their backgrounds, home state popularity and ability to sway important constituencies or independent voters.\n\nTrump's vice presidential pick, US Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has had a rocky start since joining the Republican ticket, with old comments criticizing \"childless cat ladies\" drawing unwelcome attention and potentially alienating women voters.\n\nVance will follow Harris and her new running mate to several swing states this week, the Trump campaign said, including stops in South Philadelphia on Tuesday and Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday.

Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of the running mate.\n\nAfter a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris must decide on her wingman before the two set off Tuesday on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the stakes of the election.\n\nEverything about her campaign has been rapid-fire out of necessity. She's only been a candidate for a little over two weeks, since President Joe Biden bowed out of the race following a dismal debate performance and escalating calls within the Democratic party for him to step aside. The Democratic National Committee chair said Friday that Harris had already secured enough votes to become the party's nominee and will accept the nomination Monday night when voting ends.\n\nAnd about 8 in 10 Democrats say they would be somewhat or very satisfied if Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted after Biden withdrew from the race.\n\nHarris has had to do condensed vetting of her potential running mates as the party's convention draws near. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks get in their final licks.\n\nHarris was zeroing in on three running mate contenders, whom she interviewed Sunday in Washington. They were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to a person familiar with the process who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. Three other men have been in the mix: Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz is in his second term as governor of Minnesota. He has made his state a bastion of liberal policy and, this year, one of the few states to protect fans buying tickets online for Taylor Swift concerts and other live events. He comes from rural America and in his first race for Congress, Walz upset a Republican incumbent.\n\nWalz spoke before an energetic crowd at a fundraiser Monday evening in downtown Minneapolis, but didn't drop any hints about his status on Harris' shortlist. But the governor spoke of a \"politics of joy\" that he hopes to spread on the campaign trail on behalf of Harris.\n\n\"We've got to run this campaign against the serious threat that's there, but we have to do it every single day with a sense of joy,\" he said.\n\nWalz also criticized Donald Trump and Republicans who wanted to regulate what books children read and undermine abortion rights.\n\nThe Minnesota Democratic Party, meanwhile, posted a booster for Walz online. \"IMPORTANT PSA: There's no 'T' sound in 'Walz' (But there is one in 'Vice President Walz'),\" the group wrote with a winking smiley face emoji.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles or 600 kilometers of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed.\n\nShapiro has prominent supporters, too, like Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate. A person familiar with the mayor's thinking said she had no insider knowledge about Harris' intentions.\n\nWhen asked about the veepstakes Monday, Shapiro said he had no information.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nSen.

The senator's office counters that while he did not co-sponsor the proposed legislation, he has said he would vote for it.\n\nThe nonprofit Institute for Middle East Understanding has been vocal about Shapiro, saying in a statement last week that he was not the right candidate for the job.\n\nShapiro has aggressively confronted what he views as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas as it Israel battles the militants in Gaza. But he's also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while suggesting that any end to the Israel-Hamas war requires the removal of Hamas from power.\n\nHarris and her running mate -- whoever that is -- will launch Tuesday into an aggressive battleground state tour that begins in Philadelphia on Tuesday and winds later in the week through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. A scheduled stop in Savannah, Georgia, was canceled due to the expected effects of Hurricane Debby.\n\nCampaign officials are aware that momentum can be fleeting and are working to capitalize on the energy now, while managing expectations by continuing to emphasize that the race with Republican nominee Donald Trump is tight. But the strong rollout has allowed the Harris campaign to put a number of states back in play that had been feared out of reach when Biden remained at the top of the ticket.\n\nTrump's running mate, JD Vance, was heading out on almost exactly the same campaign schedule as Harris: Philadelphia on Tuesday, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday and Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday.\n\nHe told Fox News on Sunday that Harris' pick doesn't matter to him. \"Whoever she chooses, the problem is going to be Kamala Harris' record and Kamala Harris' policies,\" he said, adding, \"It's not going to be good for the country.\"\n\nHarris' early rallies have attracted enthusiastic thousands. Campaign officials say each stop will be loaded with local election officials, religious leaders, union members and more in an effort to show the diversity of her coalition. Some Republicans will also appear with her, according to the campaign.\n\nThe campaign this week launched \"Republicans for Harris.\" The program will be a \"campaign within a campaign,\" according to Harris' team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael Goldberg in Minneapolis, Hannah Fingerhut in Des Moines, Iowa, Steve Peoples in New York and Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pa., contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@postandcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "colleen_long@postandcourier.com", "name": "Colleen Long", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz as her 2024 running mate Tuesday after replacing President Biden as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, sources say.\n\nHarris and Walz are expected to appear for the first time together at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening, four people close to the process told CNN.\n\nWalz spent 24 years in the Army National Guard and then a decade in the US House of Representatives, serving a largely rural district in southern Minnesota, before running for governor in 2018.\n\nThe Democrat would likely bring a more centrist image to the 2024 Democratic ticket after having won his gubernatorial election by double digits, with even more votes and more counties than Hillary Clinton did in the state during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nYet his first executive move as Minnesota's governor was launching a statewide Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) commission, which he renewed after being re-elected for another term in 2022.\n\nIn 2020, Walz also caught flak from the left after Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said he was too slow in deploying the National Guard to quell widespread riots in the city, which suffered $500 million in property damages and looting after the death of George Floyd.\n\nConservative critics have harped on his botched response during the COVID-19 pandemic, which included wasting more than $5 million in state funds to purchase a refrigerated warehouse for a potential morgue that remained vacant -- and permitting a $250 million scheme that defrauded the federal government of COVID stimulus dollars and exploited poor children.\n\nAs a Harris campaign surrogate, he has played the loyal foot soldier by attacking Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance as out of touch with middle America and far too socially conservative.\n\nHarris had to choose her No. 2 quickly after the Democratic National Committee adopted rules enforcing a virtual roll call vote to appoint both the presidential and vice presidential nominee in the first week of August.\n\nShe was reported to have fired off vetting materials just days after Biden suspended his presidential campaign last month.\n\nIn the days leading up to her announcement, Harris had zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists -- including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nOthers believed to be on her early vetting list had included North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\n\nOther reports indicated that Harris had also weighed Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nAll the potential candidates had come out in support of Harris, but Whitmer was the first to say she was not interested in the job, noting she did not want to in leave her post in Michigan and to run for office this year.\n\nOn Sunday, Kelly added confusion to the Democratic Party's veepstakes when he posted - then quickly deleted -- a message to X in which he said his focus was on \"serving Arizonans,\" suggesting he was not the VP pick.\n\nThe Democratic Party mostly coalesced around Harris within days of her accepting Biden's endorsement to replace him on the top of the ticket. The reported vetted candidates had been strong supporters of the Biden-Harris ticket and quickly pivoted to throw their weight behind Harris when Biden dropped his bid.\n\nOne strong Biden-Harris proponent was California Gov. Gavin Newsom, but he could not be considered because he hails from the same state as Harris.\n\nA vice presidential candidate from a swing-state could give Harris an extra boost from voters in her fight against former President Donald Trump.\n\nHarris' campaign is banking on being more successful with minority voters compared to Trump's reach, and is continuing to focus on the battleground states Biden was hoping to reach.\n\nThe potential list of VPs mostly came from the targeted swing states.\n\n\"We continue to focus on the Blue Wall states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania -- and the Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada,\" Harris for President Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon had said in a statement in the first week of the campaign shift.\n\nIt comes after Harris officially secured the Democratic presidential nomination Monday night after receiving votes from 99% of the DNC delegates during a five-day round of online voting.\n\nHarris was the only candidate who qualified for the virtual roll call electronic ballot - getting more than the required 300 delegates to back her.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate are set to spend the next few days flying thousands of miles around the country as they tour critical battleground states.\n\nThey will be tailed in some locations by Trump's vice presidential pick, JD Vance.\n\nHarris' No. 2 may have to face off in a debate against Vance, though the dates and logistics have yet to be set.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Frey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Frey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz to be her 2024 running mate, according to multiple reports, rounding out the new Democratic White House ticket.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, Harris had not formally announced her decision.\n\nWalz, 60, joined a rumored shortlist of vice presidential picks even before President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, as Democratic power brokers pondered what a strong, alternate ticket might look like.\n\nOther VP potentials who caught Harris' eye included Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Walz was initially a dark horse in the group, whose headline-generating media circuit quickly made him a serious contender.\n\nHarris had final interviews with her top running mate choices in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, which sealed the deal for Walz. The two will now hit the campaign trail together for a five-day tour of seven battleground states, beginning with a stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening.\n\nWalz is a former teacher, national guardsman and high school football coach who turned to politics in 2006 when he successfully ran for U.S. Congress as a Democrat in a historically Republican district. After 12 years in the House, during which he became a senior member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Walz soundly won the 2018 Minnesota gubernatorial race.\n\nSince his reelection, the governor has adopted a platform that aligns with a significant portion of the Biden-Harris administration. He's signed legislation into law that protected Minnesotans' access to abortion, legalized marijuana and addressed calls for police reform. A father of two, he has been open about his family's experience with IVF.\n\nThough Walz was once given an \"A\" rating by the NRA, he shifted his views on the organization after a series of mass shootings. Following the Las Vegas concert shooting in 2017, he donated the amount of all the money he'd received from the NRA to an organization that supports families of fallen soldiers. After the Parkland, Fla., school shooting in 2018, he wrote a Star Tribune op-ed about his evolving mindset. He has since helped shepherd gun safety legislation in Minnesota.\n\nWalz stands out as an experienced politician with surprising Gen Z appeal who could help Harris better speak to Midwest voters in the quest to lock down 270 Electoral College votes. Already on the campaign trail, he helped the Harris campaign find its voice by branding far-right Republican policies as \"weird\" -- a term that immediately stuck -- and in recent media appearances, he's been able to articulate a sharp ideological divide between J.D. Vance and rural Americans.\n\nRelated: J.D. Vance Isn't the Bridge-Building VP That Moderates Wanted: What He's Said About Women, Voting and Project 2025\n\nBiden, 81, made the last-minute decision on July 21 to abandon his reelection campaign amid mounting pressure from Democrats, who feared that he was not a strong enough candidate to defeat Donald Trump after seeing his performance in the first presidential debate.\n\nThe president promptly endorsed Harris to replace him on the ticket, creating a rapid trickle effect of Democratic lawmakers and delegates who determined that the most unifying path forward was to stand with Harris.\n\nRelated: Kamala Harris Raises Record $81 Million in First 24 Hours as Presidential Candidate\n\nThough other candidates could have jumped in and challenged Harris for the nomination, no major players decided to, clearing the way for Harris to become the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,\" Harris said after entering the presidential race. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dark horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

But her pick is still unknown. - The Boston Globe", "body": "Harris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will mark yet another major milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"},

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.\n\n- Hard fight - More from this section Flurry of diplomacy to ease Mideast tensions as Israel awaits Iran attack North Carolina-headquartered Barings named in Climate Action 100+ probe Lee shoots 67 to grab one-stroke LPGA Portland Classic lead\n\nShapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the center than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer who exudes folksy charm, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as \"weird\" gaining enormous traction.\n\nOther less likely contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a longstanding friend of Harris; and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nHarris threw her hat in the ring and began her search for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden exited the race on July 21.\n\nHe had been facing mounting concerns over his low popularity ratings and advanced years, and Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presiding over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Harris's rise continuing unabated ever since, with a Morning Consult survey notably placing her four points ahead of Trump nationally, 48 to 44 percent.\n\nBut a new CBS News poll found Harris's popularity among Black voters some way behind Biden's score as he defeated Trump in 2020, prompting some senior Democrats to caution against complacency.\n\n\"She has a lot of momentum, but if you do look at the polling, this is still a really tight race,\" Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod told political outlet The Hill. \"This is going to be a hard fight for either side.\"\n\nft/jgc/mlm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frankie_taggart@reformer.com", "name": "Frankie

Vance will also make a campaign stop in South Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nShapiro, 51, is a rising star of the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes makes it a must-win state for both Harris and Trump.\n\nA former state attorney general, Shapiro would add to the ticket's historical significance; he would be the country's first Jewish vice president, while Harris is seeking to become the first Black and South Asian American woman elected US president.\n\nShapiro's strong support for Israel could alienate some progressive voters, though it could also appeal to moderate voters and defang Republican efforts to turn the Israel-Gaza war into a wedge issue for Democrats.\n\nWalz, 60, is a former US Army National Guard member and a former teacher who has raised his profile in recent weeks as an effective advocate for Harris. He has attacked Trump and Vance as \"weird,\" a viral insult the Harris campaign has embraced.\n\nA former member of Congress from a Republican-leaning district, Walz has proven appeal to rural, white voters, though he has also championed progressive policies as governor, such as free school meals and expanded paid worker leave. While Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, it is close to Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial battlegrounds.\n\nSpeculation had focused on six finalists - four governors, a senator and a cabinet secretary in the Biden administration, all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.\n\nIn addition to Shapiro and Walz, contenders included US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nThe candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, sources told Reuters. The Harris campaign plans a social media announcement featuring the duo, campaign officials familiar with the arrangements said.\n\nHarris' search for a running mate began in earnest two weeks ago, shortly after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her to replace him.\n\nThere was no immediate indication that Monday's market selloff would have an impact on Harris' announcement timing. Trump, seeking to capitalize on the downturn, referred to the \"Kamala crash\" in a post on his social media site, Truth Social.\n\nOver the weekend, Harris met with her vetting team, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to multiple sources familiar with the process.\n\nHarris is weighing the decision with her husband, Doug Emhoff, brother-in-law Tony West and a small circle of aides and advisers, the sources said.", "source": {"uri": "thejakartapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jakarta Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Philadelphia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_West_(attorney)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony West (attorney)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

In picking Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice presidential nominee, Harris chooses a candidate who hasn't offended a significant wing of the Democratic base but can speak to rural and regional voters Democrats have been losing to Republicans on pocketbook issues.\n\nThis selection appears to be based on calculus rather than natural camaraderie. It is reminiscent of Joe Biden's selection of Harris as his nominee for vice president four years ago. Biden looked beyond fellow old white men to broaden his ticket's appeal. Harris, seeking to be the nation's first woman president, chose somebody complementary as well.\n\nHarris' choice of Walz implicitly says something significant about her and how she might lead at the top of the Democratic ticket. Harris chose to energize a wider swath of Democrats, wavering independents and disillusioned Republicans rather than narrowly gravitating to someone like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a former prosecutor like her.\n\nWith this pick, the native Bay Area resident (born in Oakland, and ascended to public office in San Francisco) is stepping out from President Joe Biden's shadow and the ranks of California political heavyweights Harris who once mentored her until she rose higher than any of them as the presidential nominee of their party.\n\nOpinion\n\nHarris could have shored up a bigger electoral prize in Pennsylvania with the selection of Shapiro. But he had baggage of his own, a devout Jew whose pro-Israel stances had already enflamed the pro-Palestine wing of the party.\n\nShe could have picked Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, Navy veteran and rising star who helped turn his once-red state blue.. But Kelly has rankled some union leaders for opposing legislation that would make it easier for workers to organize.\n\nShe could have gone with one of the party's most popular members and arguably the star of the Biden cabinet, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. But it's unclear whether the country is ready to elect a woman of Asian and Jamaican descent as president and a gay man as vice president, even one who served in the military.\n\nTo consider Walz as merely a candidate by deduction, however, underestimates his potential. The Democratic ticket has a sense of seriousness and stability that former President Donald Trump and Republican running mate J.D. Vance lack.\n\nWalz has captured considerable national attention thanks to a single-word utterance, recently calling Republican opponent Donald Trump \"weird.\" To large cross-sections of America, Walz may be the most potent Democrat on the campaign stump to go after Trump both personally and politically.\n\nTrump \"doesn't laugh unless he is laughing at someone,\" Walz recently said. Trump has \"weird stories and an inability to connect like a human being in any way.\"\n\nThe straight-shooting Walz is pure Middle America, born in Nebraska. He was drawn to a career as a high school teacher, coaching the football team one year to a state championship. By day he was a member of the National Guard. He chose politics and public policy in his \"retirement.\"\n\nWalz is 60, no spring chicken (Harris is 59), but no geriatric either. He poses quite the contrast to Trump's vice presidential pick, two-year Ohio Senator Vance, who has repeatedly questioned the wisdom of public service for women who have not had children themselves.\n\nShapiro and Kelly in particular had some appeal given how they were from swing states that are crucial for both Republicans and Democrats to win come November. Historically, however, selections based on perceived home-field advantages are the exception rather than the rule. Harris provided no geographic appeal to Biden, coming from California with her experience as state Attorney General and San Francisco District Attorney before her service in the Senate.\n\nHarris is a prosecutor who learned politics. In Walz, she picked somebody who is gifted at prosecuting the case against Trump. That's a skill that the top of this ticket truly values. And with precious little time to make its case, every campaign stop and every speech will matter to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\nNow Walz goes under the magnifying glass. He must endure the sometimes vicious vetting within his party and the coming insults from Trump, which are as sure as the sun.

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.\n\n- Hard fight -\n\nShapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the center than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer who exudes folksy charm, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as \"weird\" gaining enormous traction.\n\nOther less likely contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a longstanding friend of Harris; and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nHarris threw her hat in the ring and began her search for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden exited the race on July 21.\n\nHe had been facing mounting concerns over his low popularity ratings and advanced years, and Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presiding over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Harris's rise continuing unabated ever since, with a Morning Consult survey notably placing her four points ahead of Trump nationally, 48 to 44 percent.\n\nBut a new CBS News poll found Harris's popularity among Black voters some way behind Biden's score as he defeated Trump in 2020, prompting some senior Democrats to caution against complacency.\n\n\"She has a lot of momentum, but if you do look at the polling, this is still a really tight race,\" Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod told political outlet The Hill. \"This is going to be a hard fight for either side.\"\n\nft/jgc/mlm\n\nMore from this section\n\nThe UN Acknowledges Foundation for a Drug-Free World With Consultative Status\n\nAttorney Jenna Sutter Joins All Injuries Law

But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nElections Trump is making his 2024 campaign about Harris' race, whether Republicans want him to or not By STEVE PEOPLES and MATT BROWN Associated Press\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\nCrime-courts Civil Rights Movement Freedom Riders urge younger activists to get out the vote CHARLOTTE KRAMON Associated Press/Report for America\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nElections Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' race as he appears at gathering of Black journalists By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nElections Russia is relying on unwitting Americans to spread election disinformation, officials say DAVID KLEPPER Associated Press\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zeke_miller@pantagraph.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@pantagraph.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

A popular member of Congress, he reportedly had the backing of powerful former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in persuading Biden to leave the race.\n\nHarris and Walz will face Trump and his running mate JD Vance, also a military veteran from the Midwest, in a Nov. 5 election.\n\nStumping for Harris, sometimes in a camouflage baseball hat and T-shirt, Walz has attacked Trump and Vance as \"weird,\" a catchy insult that has been picked up by the Harris campaign, social media and Democratic activists.\n\nA 'UNICORN'\n\nWalz gave the nascent Harris campaign the new attack line in a late July interview: \"These are weird people on the other side: They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\" referring to book bans and women's reproductive consultations with doctors.\n\nWalz has also attacked the claims by Trump and Vance of having middle class credentials.\n\n\"They keep talking about the middle class. A robber baron real estate guy and a venture capitalist trying to tell us they understand who we are? They don't know who we are,\" Walz said in an MSNBC interview.\n\nThat approach has struck a chord with the young voters Harris needs to reengage. David Hogg, the co-founder of the gun safety group March for Our Lives, described him as a \"great communicator.\"\n\nWalz is \"somewhat of a unicorn,\" said Ryan Dawkins, a political science professor at Minnesota's Carleton College - a man born in a small town in rural Nebraska capable of conveying Harris' message to core Democratic voters, and those that the party has failed to reach in recent years.\n\nDawkins praised his ability to connect with rural voters. It is a group the Biden administration has tried to reach with infrastructure spending and other pragmatic policies, but with little show of messaging success so far.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Trump won 59% of rural voters; in 2020 that number rose to 65% even though Trump lost the election, according to Pew Research.\n\nIn the 2022 governor's race, Walz won with 52.27% to his Republican opponent's 44.61%, although swaths of rural Minnesota voted for the opponent.\n\nWhile Walz has supported Democratic Party orthodoxy on issues ranging from legalized abortion and same-sex marriage to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, he also racked up a centrist voting record during his congressional career.\n\nHe was a staunch defender of government support for farmers and military veterans, as well as gun-owner rights that won praise from the National Rifle Association, according to The Almanac of American Politics.\n\nHe subsequently registered a failing grade with the NRA after supporting gun-control measures during his first campaign for governor.\n\nWalz's shift from a centrist representing a single rural district in Congress to a more progressive politician as governor may have been in response to the demands of voters in major cities like Minneapolis-St. Paul. But it leaves him open to Republican attacks, Dawkins said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"He runs the risk of reinforcing some of the worst fears people have of Kamala Harris being a San Francisco liberal,\" Dawkins said.\n\nWalz has a ready counter-attack.\n\n\"What a monster. Kids are eating and having full bellies, so they can go learn and women are making their own healthcare decisions,\" Walz said in a July CNN interview. \"So if that's where they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label.\"\n\nAs the state's top executive, Walz mandated the use of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic and signed a law making marital rape illegal. He presided over several years of budget surpluses in Minnesota on the road to his 2022 reelection.\n\nDuring that campaign, Walz touted the backing of several influential labor unions, including the state AFL-CIO, firefighters, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), teachers and others.\n\nHis tenure was marked by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murder. Walz assigned the state's attorney general to lead the prosecution in the case, saying people \"don't believe justice can be served.\"\n\n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Richard Cowan; Editing by

Tim Walz as running mate", "body": "WASHINGTON - Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, The Associated Press and CNN reported Tuesday morning. She was expected to make the announcement later in the day before the two appeared together at a Philadelphia rally.\n\nHarris' choice of Walz as a running mate was based on a number of factors, including the governor's ties to Capitol Hill and relationship with the nation's Democratic governors.\n\nHarris was searching for a vice president who could be a governing partner and has executive experience and would bring demographic balance to the first major party ticket that will be headed by a woman of color.\n\nWalz fit the bill.\n\nBut he also has other strengths. He represented a red district in southern Minnesota in Congress for a dozen years and did so, colleagues say, by the strength of personality and willingness to consider the concerns of conservative and moderate constituents when he cast his votes.\n\nWalz beat out other candidates, including Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Walz has deep relations on Capitol Hill which President Biden has but Harris was unable to develop during her four years in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAnd Walz, once a member of the moderate wing of U.S. House Democrats, had the support from across the party's ideological spectrum on Capitol Hill. Both members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, like Rep. Angie Craig, D-2 District, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, backed Walz's candidacy.\n\nOne progressive, Rep. Mark Takano, D-California, was once locked into a bitter rivalry with Walz. According to U.S. House Democratic rules, lawmakers can only belong to two standing committees, but Walz, a former National Guard commander, obtained a waiver from Democratic leadership to add the House Veterans Affairs Committee to his resume.\n\nThen Walz sought to be the top Democrat on the committee, arguing he had more seniority than Takano, who was poised to take that job as the longest-serving Democrat on the panel. A skirmish ensued.\n\n\"I had to stand my ground,\" Takano said. \"I thought I performed very strongly, but for the sake of unity I stepped aside.\"\n\nHowever, Takano said Walz included him in major decisions, including the overhaul of staff on the committee and the interviews of new staffers.\n\nA few months into leading the committee, Walz announced he was running for governor. \"That meant the spot would be vacant,\" Takano said.\n\nA progressive, Takano needed the support of moderate Democrats -- a group that Walz belonged to in Congress -- to persuade Democratic leaders to allow him to lead the committee after he left the U.S. Capitol for the governor's mansion.\n\n\"He endorsed me. He told folks he had confidence in me,\" Takano said. \"That allowed me to amass support for the leadership of the committee.\"\n\nAs far as his onetime rival, Takano now says he has \"great fondness\" for Walz and that the governor \"is a natural\" for the job of vice president.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, who also served with Walz on the Veterans Affairs Committee, called Walz \"the real deal\" in a post on X that endorsed the governor for vice president.\n\nRep. Betty McCollum, D-4th District, also served alongside Walz in Congress.\n\n\"I helped recruit Tim in 2006, but he was never expected to win that first race for Congress in a tough rural Republican district. He won because he and Gwen campaigned so hard, tirelessly, and Tim was always true to his values, his community, and his commitment to service,\" McCollum said.\n\nShe also said Walz's life experience as a teacher, football coach and soldier \"is what he brought to Congress, along with a real Midwestern work ethic.\"\n\n\"Tim knows how to work across the aisle and deliver in the halls of Congress, which is something a Harris administration will need,\" McCollum said.\n\nHead of the Democratic Governors Association, Walz has also made friends with many of the nation's Democratic governors. He responded to their concerns over President Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump by arranging a White House meeting between these governors and the president. Biden dropped his bid for reelection about two weeks later.\n\nRutgers University political science professor Ross Baker said Walz's relationship with congressional lawmakers and knowledge of the way Congress works boosted his candidacy \"very much,\" as well as his experience as governor.\n\n\"He knows Washington and the states,\" Baker said. \"He's a very experienced, very successful politician and he's obviously a hard worker.\"\n\nWalz was also boosted by the nation's labor unions, who lobbied for his candidacy. Shapiro's support of vouchers infuriated the teacher's unions, and Kelly ran afoul of organized labor for failing to support pro-union legislation in the U.S. Senate.\n\nOn \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, before Harris made her decision, United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Walz were the union's two top picks for the vice presidency.\n\nHarris selected and vetted candidates for running mate with breakneck speed. That swift decision making was governed by the desire to show unity and strength at the Democratic National Convention that begins on Aug. 19 and the rapidly approaching general election in November.\n\n\"The average search for a vice president takes 18 weeks, and she's done it in two,\" said Jacob Rubashkin of Inside Elections.\n\nIf the Harris-Walz ticket is victorious in November, Walz would follow two Minnesotans who were accomplished vice presidents and left their mark on history -- Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nAs Minneapolis mayor, just months before he was elected U.S. Senator from Minnesota, Humphrey led the opposition to his party's tepid approach to civil rights at the 1948 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nHe was successful in changing the party's platform on civil rights, which helped elect Harry Truman as president because that attracted Black voters.\n\nAs Lyndon Johnson's vice president, Humphrey continued to press for greater civil rights and promote Johnson's \"Great Society,\" a wide-scale fight against poverty.\n\nWhile Humphrey helped to found the DFL Party, Mondale was a chief party strategist. He was appointed to Humphrey's U.S. Senate seat after Humphrey won the vice presidency, then was later selected as Jimmy Carter's vice president.\n\nAs vice president, Mondale expanded the role from figurehead to presidential adviser, with an office in the West Wing and a home in Observatory Circle. He was the first vice president to be a full-time participant in White House affairs and was given a lead on foreign policy. As part of that, Mondale intervened to save refugees from the Vietnam War, known as \"boat people,\" and offer them asylum, which resulted in the resettlement of Vietnamese, Laotians, Hmong and Cambodians in Minnesota and other parts of the country.", "source": {"uri": "minnpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MinnPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_radelat@minnpost.com", "name": "Ana

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nShapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the center than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer who exudes folksy charm, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as \"weird\" gaining enormous traction.\n\nOther less likely contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a longstanding friend of Harris; and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nHarris threw her hat in the ring and began her search for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden exited the race on July 21.\n\nHe had been facing mounting concerns over his low popularity ratings and advanced years, and Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presiding over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Harris's rise continuing unabated ever since, with a Morning Consult survey notably placing her four points ahead of Trump nationally, 48 to 44 percent.", "source": {"uri":

She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThat the schedule was set before her running mate was identified recalls a cliffhanger-like scenario that Trump created by holding off on making his choice of vice presidential hopeful, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention was under way in Milwaukee.\n\nVance, meanwhile, is aiming to detract from the debut of Harris' pick on Tuesday. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic ticket and offer his own speech at midday, as counterprogramming.\n\nThe senator then announced he'd shadow Harris and her running mate with his own events in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. It was unclear how the weather might affect his southern swing.\n\nIn announcing Vance's travels, the Trump campaign laid the blame for a litany of woes on Harris and Democratic policies, saying that \"prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, and crime is running rampant. The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies.\"\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, welcomed the overlapping destinations.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it has invited faith leaders, union members and state and local elected officials to participate in the upcoming events. Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as friendly to organized labor as they'd like.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tim Walz after narrowing down her choices to him and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nBut the Democratic campaign had to print signs with the VP's name along with multiple of the finalists to be prepared for when she unveils who will run alongside her in November as her decision comes down to the wire.\n\nHarris is preparing to appear alongside her VP pick at a rally in Philadelphia later Tuesday evening, which will kickoff a five-day, seven-state campaign swing through 2024 battleground territory.\n\nBeside Walz and Shapiro, others thought to be on Harris' shortlist are Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nMost establishment Democrats appear to still be rooting for Shapiro and say he provides the party a higher chance of winning the swing state of Pennsylvania.\n\nOne Democratic strategist told Politico:\n\nWe were down for seven months, so where we are today feels like we're winning. But we are just back to even, we're not winning. And a point in Pennsylvania is worth a hundred points, because in a 50-50 race, it's everything.\n\nAfter announcing her running mate, the duo will have less than two weeks to campaign together before the Democratic National Convention this month where Harris and her pick are expected to become the Party's presidential and vice presidential nominees.\n\nDay 16 of VP Harris avoiding answering to the press\n\nBy Katelyn Caralle, Senior U.S. Political Reporter\n\nIt's been 16 days since Kamala Harris entered the 2024 race and she has still not held a press conference.\n\nThe vice president has also not sat down for any interviews or taken a single questions from media since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid last month.\n\nWhile Harris has engaged in a hefty campaigning schedule in the more than two weeks since announcing her candidacy, she has managed to avoid answering to the press.\n\nIt's unclear how long Harris will be able to hold off, but some online are already raising questions and wondering out loud how the VP will hanlde 'unscripted moments' as the Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump V Kamala is on as Harris secures Democratic presidential nomination and new poll reveals she is leading 48 points to 44\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination - with a new poll revealing she has a four-point lead over Donald Trump as the two prepare to battle it out.\n\nHarris is ahead with 48% while former President Trump is on 44%, according to a survey of 11,265 voters conducted by Morning Consult between August 2 and 4.\n\nThe firm described it as a 'record-high margin in her favor' and is the 'largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year.'\n\nThe latest poll suggests a marginal gap may be opening up between the Democrat and Republican nominees - with a previous poll pointing to a dead heat between the pair.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll over the weekend found that nationally, Harris was leading Trump with 50% to 49% among likely voters. In battleground states, they were said to be tied at 50 percent each.\n\nWith the nomination under her belt, Harris is now set to announce her choice for VP - a decision which commentators say is believed to be narrowing down to Pennsylvania Governor Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Walz.\n\nMontana's Democratic Senator Jon Tester accused of 'covering up' Biden's decline in brutal ad launched in battleground state\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jon Tester lied about Joe Biden's ability to do the job of president -- that is the brutal message of a new attack ad in Montana, a high stakes election contest where both sides know that victory in November could deliver control of the Senate.\n\nThe 30-second spot, produced by More Jobs, Less Government, a super PAC supporting his Republican opponent Tim Sheehy, goes up on Tuesday.\n\nIt opens with Democrat Tester's own words.\n\n'Joe Biden, when I've been around him, and that's not every day ... he's absolutely 100 per cent with it,' he says in the ad produced by More Jobs, Less Government, a super PAC supporting his Republican opponent Tim Sheehy.\n\n'That wasn't true, says the narrator.

Harris will hold a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, where Walz is expected to attend.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal previously reported that the Harris campaign sought vetting materials from Walz, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois.\n\nKentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg had also been widely mentioned as possible contenders.\n\nHarris became the likely Democratic candidate for president after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping down from the race, following weeks of calls for him to do so after a widely criticized debate performance against Republican nominee Donald Trump. Biden endorsed Harris shortly after announcing his decision. Harris has also received endorsements from other top Democratic names, including former President Barack Obama.\n\nHarris officially become the Democratic nominee for president on Monday night and will accept the nomination at the Democratic National Convention later in August.\n\nWalz serves as the Democratic governor of Minnesota, a seat he has held since 2019. He previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Minnesota's 1st Congressional District from 2007 to 2019.\n\nIn 2018, Walz defeated Republican challenger Jeff Johnson to win Minnesota's gubernatorial election.\n\nWalz married to Gwen Walz, who's maiden name is Whipple, in 1994. Gwen is an educator with roots in public service. She grew up in Minnesota and graduated from Gustavus Adolphus College and Minnesota State University. After graduation, she taught English in western Nebraska and served as an administrator and coordinator for the Mankato Area Public Schools.\n\nGwen has played a crucial role in advocating for educational reform and wellness initiatives across the state of Minnesota.\n\nWalz and Whipple are parents to two children, Hope and Gus, whom they raised in Mankato, Minnesota, before moving to St. Paul after he was elected governor.\n\nIn February, Walz spoke about his two children in a Facebook post saying, \"Gwen and I have two beautiful children because of reproductive health care like IVF. This issue is deeply personal to our family and so many others.\"\n\nIn 2021, Walz also shared a Father's Day post on Facebook with his two children saying \"I am so lucky to be a dad to these two amazing kids!\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_impelli@newsweek.com", "name": "Matthew Impelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nElections Trump is making his 2024 campaign about Harris' race, whether Republicans want him to or not By STEVE PEOPLES and MATT BROWN Associated Press\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\nGovernment-politics Civil Rights Movement Freedom Riders urge younger activists to get out the vote CHARLOTTE KRAMON Associated Press/Report for America\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nElections Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' race as he appears at gathering of Black journalists By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nElections Russia is relying on unwitting Americans to spread election disinformation, officials say DAVID KLEPPER Associated Press\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016.

A popular member of Congress, he reportedly had the backing of powerful former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in persuading Biden to leave the race.\n\nHarris and Walz will face Trump and his running mate JD Vance, also a military veteran from the Midwest, in a Nov. 5 election.\n\nStumping for Harris, sometimes in a camouflage baseball hat and T-shirt, Walz has attacked Trump and Vance as \"weird,\" a catchy insult that has been picked up by the Harris campaign, social media and Democratic activists.\n\nA 'UNICORN'\n\nWalz gave the nascent Harris campaign the new attack line in a late July interview: \"These are weird people on the other side: They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\" referring to book bans and women's reproductive consultations with doctors.\n\nWalz has also attacked the claims by Trump and Vance of having middle class credentials.\n\n\"They keep talking about the middle class. A robber baron real estate guy and a venture capitalist trying to tell us they understand who we are? They don't know who we are,\" Walz said in an MSNBC interview.\n\nThat approach has struck a chord with the young voters Harris needs to reengage. David Hogg, the co-founder of the gun safety group March for Our Lives, described him as a \"great communicator.\"\n\nSign up for free: Weekly 7 Catch up with a rundown of the 7 most important and interesting stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

View all of our newsletters.\n\nWalz is \"somewhat of a unicorn,\" said Ryan Dawkins, a political science professor at Minnesota's Carleton College - a man born in a small town in rural Nebraska capable of conveying Harris' message to core Democratic voters, and those that the party has failed to reach in recent years.\n\nDawkins praised his ability to connect with rural voters. It is a group the Biden administration has tried to reach with infrastructure spending and other pragmatic policies, but with little show of messaging success so far.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Trump won 59% of rural voters; in 2020 that number rose to 65% even though Trump lost the election, according to Pew Research.\n\nIn the 2022 governor's race, Walz won with 52.27% to his Republican opponent's 44.61%, although swaths of rural Minnesota voted for the opponent.\n\nWhile Walz has supported Democratic Party orthodoxy on issues ranging from legalized abortion and same-sex marriage to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, he also racked up a centrist voting record during his congressional career.\n\nHe was a staunch defender of government support for farmers and military veterans, as well as gun-owner rights that won praise from the National Rifle Association, according to The Almanac of American Politics.\n\nHe subsequently registered a failing grade with the NRA after supporting gun-control measures during his first campaign for governor.\n\nWalz's shift from a centrist representing a single rural district in Congress to a more progressive politician as governor may have been in response to the demands of voters in major cities like Minneapolis-St. Paul. But it leaves him open to Republican attacks, Dawkins said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"He runs the risk of reinforcing some of the worst fears people have of Kamala Harris being a San Francisco liberal,\" Dawkins said.\n\nWalz has a ready counter-attack.\n\n\"What a monster. Kids are eating and having full bellies, so they can go learn and women are making their own healthcare decisions,\" Walz said in a July CNN interview. \"So if that's where they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label.\"\n\nAs the state's top executive, Walz mandated the use of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic and signed a law making marital rape illegal. He presided over several years of budget surpluses in Minnesota on the road to his 2022 reelection.\n\nDuring that campaign, Walz touted the backing of several influential labor unions, including the state AFL-CIO, firefighters, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), teachers and others.\n\nHis tenure was marked by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murder. Walz assigned the state's attorney general to lead the prosecution in the case, saying people \"don't believe justice can be served.\"\n\n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Richard Cowan; Editing by

This is not an insult to the Minnesota governor. Minnesota is not a crucial swing state. And Walz, a 60-year-old former geography teacher-turned congressman-turned governor with the genial bearing of \"a guy you would meet at a backyard barbecue in the Midwest,\" as one colleague described him, was not exactly a rising star of the Democratic party or a well-known national figure. But then he went on television and called Donald Trump and JD Vance \"weird\".\n\n\"They want to take books away, they want to be in your exam room,\" Walz said during the MSNBC interview on 23 July. \"These are weird ideas.\" He posted a clip on Twitter, which at the time of writing has 5.6 million views. More importantly, the term \"weird\" immediately permeated the Democratic political firmament. Within days, Harris had worked the attack line into her campaign speeches and prominent Democrats, including the top vice-presidential contenders, could not stop talking about how \"weird\" their Republican opponents were.\n\nWalz embarked on a blitz of television studios, podcasts, and campaign events, expounding on his \"weird\" philosophy. Whereas Democrats had previously tended towards grave warnings about Trump and Vance as an existential threat to democracy, Walz poked fun at them. \"These guys are just weird, that's who they are,\" Walz told supporters in St Paul, Minnesota, on 27 July. \"But we're not afraid of weird people. We're a little bit creeped out, but we're not afraid.\" The New York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein spoke for many on the left when he asked: \"Is Tim Walz the Midwestern Dad Democrats Need?\" Harris apparently thinks so: on 6 August, Walz was chosen to be her running mate.\n\nBorn in rural Nebraska in 1964, Walz likes to talk about how he grew up in a small town of 400 people, contrasting his own experience of life in the American midwest with the version depicted in JD Vance's best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. \"My hillbilly cousins did not go to Yale,\" he told one interviewer recently. \"But I'll tell you what they did. They contributed to our community and they're proud of it.\" Vance is right to diagnose the anger of struggling communities in the former manufacturing heartlands, Walz says, but wrong about where to direct the blame. \"We're angry because robber barons like him gutted middle America,\" he said. \"They took our jobs.\"\n\nAfter graduating high school at 17, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard, part of the US reserve forces, where he served in a field artillery battalion and rose to the rank of command sergeant major over the next 24 years before he retired in 2005. He studied social science education at university and taught English in China for a year after graduating in 1989, before becoming a high school geography teacher in Minnesota. He met his future wife, Gwen, a fellow teacher, at the school, who complained that his voice was so loud it interrupted her lessons.\n\nWalz was the first faculty adviser to the high school's gay-straight alliance and coached the football team to win the state championship in 1999. He volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign in 2004 and ran for congress in 2006, defeating the Republican incumbent and winning re-election five times in a predominantly rural, previously Republican-leaning district. He was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and re-elected in 2022, where he has pushed through legislation to provide free meals for all schoolchildren and vowed to make Minnesota the best state in the country to raise a family.\n\nWalz is also a passionate hunter, who has boasted of his prowess at shooting pheasants, but he has supported an assault weapon ban and tighter restrictions on gun ownership since the mass shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. He subsequently denounced the National Rifle Association (NRA) and said that he would donate the equivalent of the money they had previously donated to his campaigns to charity.\n\nThe Republican line of attack on Walz will be that he is too left-wing. Trump and Vance have already been pushing the message that Harris is a \"dangerously liberal\" progressive from California. By selecting Walz as her running mate, they will argue that Harris has caved to the demands of the left, which mounted a concerted campaign against Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro becoming her running mate in the days leading up to the announcement. Shapiro, who is Jewish, was attacked by members of his own party over his past support for private school vouchers, fracking, and most significantly Israel, with pro-Palestinian campaigners calling him \"genocide Josh\". By contrast, Walz had emerged as the consensus choice among progressives and the anti-Shapiro crowd.\n\nYet unlike Shapiro, who is wildly popular in Pennsylvania, a must-win battleground state for the Democrats, Walz does not come with a significant home state advantage. Minnesota should already be well within Harris's grasp. She will hope instead that his combination of midwestern appeal, small town roots, and backing from veterans' groups and teachers' unions will enable him to push back against Trump and Vance in the crucial northern rustbelt states and assuage swing voters' concerns. In her first major test in this campaign, Harris has chosen party unity, concerned that Shapiro's candidacy would have divided the left. Certainly, Tim Walz offends no one, but the affable Minnesota governor will now need to show that he can win.", "source": {"uri": "newstatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Statesman"},

A popular member of Congress, he reportedly had the backing of powerful former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in persuading Biden to leave the race.\n\nMs Harris and Mr Walz will face Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, also a military veteran from the Midwest, in a Nov 5 election.\n\nStumping for Ms Harris, sometimes in a camouflage baseball hat and T-shirt, Mr Walz has attacked Trump and Mr Vance as \"weird,\" a catchy insult that has been picked up by the Harris campaign, social media and Democratic activists.\n\nMr Walz gave the nascent Harris campaign the new attack line in a late July interview: \"These are weird people on the other side: They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\" referring to book bans and women's reproductive consultations with doctors.\n\nMr Walz has also attacked the claims by Trump and Vance of having middle class credentials.\n\n\"They keep talking about the middle class. A robber baron real estate guy and a venture capitalist trying to tell us they understand who we are? They don't know who we are,\" Mr Walz said in an MSNBC interview.\n\nThat approach has struck a chord with the young voters Ms Harris needs to reengage. Mr David Hogg, the co-founder of the gun safety group March for Our Lives, described him as a \"great communicator.\"", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits

Tim Walz as running mate, aiming to add Midwest muscle to ticket", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "newsadvance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsAdvance.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zeke_miller@newsadvance.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@newsadvance.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Midwest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016.

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.\n\n- Hard fight -\n\nShapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the center than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer who exudes folksy charm, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as \"weird\" gaining enormous traction.\n\nOther less likely contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a longstanding friend of Harris; and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nHarris threw her hat in the ring and began her search for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden exited the race on July 21.\n\nHe had been facing mounting concerns over his low popularity ratings and advanced years, and Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presiding over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Harris's rise continuing unabated ever since, with a Morning Consult survey notably placing her four points ahead of Trump nationally, 48 to 44 percent.\n\nBut a new CBS News poll found Harris's popularity among Black voters some way behind Biden's score as he defeated Trump in 2020, prompting some senior Democrats to caution against complacency.\n\n\"She has a lot of momentum, but if you do look at the polling, this is still a really tight race,\" Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod told political outlet The Hill. \"This is going to be a hard fight

Tim Walz to be her vice president running mate, according to a report by The Washington Post.\n\nVice President Harris has told allies that she has selected the 60-year-old Walz, with the Washington Post citing \"two people familiar with the pick\" in their Tuesday morning story.\n\nWalz was reportedly preferred due to his status as a military veteran and a gun owner who formerly represented a conservative Republican part of Minnesota while in Congress, said the Washington Post.\n\nBen Shapiro, a prominent conservative activist and co-founder of The Daily Wire, took to social media shortly after the news broke to claim that the selection would benefit Republicans.\n\n\"Picking Walz is a massive gift to the Republicans. He's a radical Leftist from a non-swing state with a long history of insane statements, who presided over the burning down of his state in 2020. Kamala picked him because he's not a Jew,\" he tweeted.\n\nLast month, following questions about his mental and physical fitness, President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek reelection, and endorsed Harris for the Democrat Party nomination.\n\n\"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made,\" Biden stated last month.\n\n\"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats -- it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nSince then, Harris has garnered support and endorsements from many prominent Democrat politicians and leaders, among them former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama.\n\nWhen it came to selecting a running mate, Reuters reported on Monday that Harris had narrowed her choice down to either Walz or Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, with the outlet citing \"three sources with knowledge of the matter.\"\n\nHarris was expected to make a final choice on a vice presidential running mate by Tuesday, when she was scheduled to make a public appearance at Temple University in Philadelphia, noted Reuters.\n\nHarris' selection of Walz comes as the current vice president has successfully secured enough delegate votes from the Democrat Party to officially secure the nomination for president.\n\nWhile many progressives have hailed this accomplishment, some, among them the Black Lives Matter organization, have taken issue with the way in which she clenched the nomination.\n\n\"We do not live in a dictatorship,\" Black Lives Matter stated last month. \"Installing Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee and an unknown vice president without any public voting process would make the modern Democratic Party a party of hypocrites.\"", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"},

Tim Walz appears at Minneapolis fundraiser for Kamala Harris ahead of her vice president announcement", "body": "By Briana Bierschbach, Elliot Hughes and Sydney Kashiwagi, Star Tribune The Tribune Content Agency\n\nMINNEAPOLIS - Gov. Tim Walz rallied Democrats at a private Minneapolis fundraiser for presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on Monday as she prepared to announce whether he - or someone else - will run alongside her on the November ballot.\n\nWalz didn't address whether he was still in the running for vice president in his speech, but he praised Harris as someone who has brought energy and laughter back into politics after former President Donald Trump \"stole our joy.\"\n\n\"We've got an opportunity in front of us, we've got a chance to spread joy, we've got a chance to put an end to the division in this country and we have an opportunity to bring folks back in,\" Walz told the crowd.\n\nHarris' campaign is expected to announce her running mate sometime before a Tuesday evening rally in Philadelphia, where she will kick off a tour of battleground states with her new running mate, including an event in Eau Claire, Wis., on Wednesday.\n\nWalz canceled other planned campaign stops in New Hampshire on Sunday and reportedly flew to Washington, D.C., where Harris was conducting final interviews for her vice presidential nominee with a shortlist of candidates. Along with Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were also reportedly on the list of finalists interviewed over the weekend.\n\nSome attendees at Monday's fundraiser wore blue T-shirts supporting Walz for vice president that said \"don't be weird,\" referencing his line of attack against the Republican ticket that has reframed Democratic messaging in recent weeks.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird, it was an observation,\" he told the crowd. \"No one is asking to raise the price of insulin, nobody is asking to not fund Social Security. No one is sitting in a bar saying 'You know what we really need to do in this country? We need to ban Animal Farm.'\"\n\nDFL Party Chair Ken Martin and Minnesota U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith also rallied on behalf of Harris. Klobuchar praised Walz, who she has endorsed for vice president.\n\n\"Tim's been in the news,\" Klobuchar told the crowd. \"The country and the world is seeing the guy that we have loved so much. They are seeing someone who came from humble roots, worked his way up as a teacher, as a veteran who served our country in every way possible.\"\n\nThe fundraiser in Minneapolis is one of several Walz has headlined for Harris in recent days. Last week he appeared at a fundraiser at Urban Growler in St. Paul, which was attended by as many as 200 guests. Tickets ranged from $150 to $2,500 and the invite included a who's who of Democratic operatives in the state.\n\nThe fundraisers could be an opportunity to show off Walz's money-raising capabilities and connections as he auditions for vice president.\n\n\"Media and money are key elements of veepstakes auditions; who can praise and who can raise,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, a former presidential candidate who's backing Walz for VP.\n\nWalz's name quickly rose to the top of Harris' shortlist for her running mate after Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21. Since then, he has appeared almost daily on cable news networks on behalf of Harris.\n\nIn his appearances, Walz has also woven in details of his life as a high school geography teacher, military veteran and football coach who represented a largely rural district in Congress for a dozen years, a contrast to Harris' r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a former attorney general and U.S. Senator from California.\n\nWalz has been coy about whether he's being vetted by Harris for vice president. At a news conference last week, he said the attention has been surreal.\n\n\"I don't know if every high school geography teacher expects to be in this position at some point,\" he said, adding: \"That's a decision that needs to be made by the vice president and she will make it on what she sees. I am who I am.\"\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's how the process worked\n\nDemocratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nElections Trump is making his 2024 campaign about Harris' race, whether Republicans want him to or not By STEVE PEOPLES and MATT BROWN Associated Press\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\nPolitics Civil Rights Movement Freedom Riders urge younger activists to get out the vote CHARLOTTE KRAMON Associated Press/Report for America\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nElections Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' race as he appears at gathering of Black journalists By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act.

Here's how the process worked\n\nDemocratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nElections Trump is making his 2024 campaign about Harris' race, whether Republicans want him to or not By STEVE PEOPLES and MATT BROWN Associated Press\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\nElections Civil Rights Movement Freedom Riders urge younger activists to get out the vote CHARLOTTE KRAMON Associated Press/Report for America\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nElections Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' race as he appears at gathering of Black journalists By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nElections Russia is relying on unwitting Americans to spread election disinformation, officials say DAVID KLEPPER Associated Press\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016.

Since then, she has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and recast the race against Republican Donald Trump with a boost of energy from her party's base.\n\nAlthough she had gathered enough delegates to be her party's nominee, the Democratic National Committee said late on Monday that she had officially secured the nomination.\n\nHarris is expected to appear with her running mate at an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening. Her selection will demonstrate her thinking about her best pathway to winning the presidency and show who she believes would serve as an effective governing partner should she prevail against Trump.\n\nShapiro, 51, is a rising star in the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes make it a must-win state for both Harris and Trump.\n\nWalz, 60, serves as governor in a solidly Democratic state but has proven appeal to rural, white voters, who in recent years have voted broadly for Trump.\n\nAmericans typically focus on the person at the top of the ticket when choosing whom to vote for, but vice-presidential candidates can help or hurt their running mates based on their backgrounds, home state popularity and ability to sway important constituencies or independent voters.\n\nTrump's vice-presidential pick, US Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has had a rocky start since joining the Republican ticket, with old comments criticising \"childless cat ladies\" drawing unwelcome attention and potentially alienating women voters.\n\nVance will follow Harris and her new running mate to several swing states this week, the Trump campaign said, including stops in South Philadelphia on Tuesday and Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday.

Tim Walz as her VP pick: reports", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris has named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her 2024 running mate. Walz served for six terms in the US House before winning the 2018 Minnesota gubernatorial election. As governor, Walz has overseen a raft of liberal priorities become law.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential pick, according to CNN, Washington Post, and the Associated Press, tapping a Midwestern mainstay who has deep roots in rural America to balance out the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\nHarris' selection effectively ends a whirlwind process for the Democratic Party after President Joe Biden decided to exit the 2024 race. Harris became the presumptive nominee, buoyed by Biden's endorsement, after clearing the field of any major challengers.\n\nWalz, 60, has served both in Congress and as Minnesota governor, boasting an expansive resume that set him a part from the other two reported finalists, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.\n\nA Republican presidential nominee has not won Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972, but the Trump campaign is optimistic that they can make the state competitive. The former president held a rally in Minnesota not long before Walz's selection was announced.\n\nLike others who wanted to join the ticket, Walz made sure to complete a media blitz in recent days. During his quasi audition, the Minnesotan showed that he was more than willing to embrace the \"attack dog\" role often adopted by running mates. Walz blasted Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee, as someone who didn't understand what small town America was really about.\n\n\"What I know is that people like JD Vance know nothing about small town America,\" Walz recently told MSNBC. \"My town had 400 people in it, 2,400 kids in my graduating class, 12 were cousins, and he gets it all wrong. It's not about hate. It's not about collapsing in. The golden rule is mind your own damn business. Their policies are what have destroyed rural America.\"\n\nAs governor, Walz has signed a raft of liberal priorities into law, including a guarantee for paid family and medical leave, protection of abortion rights, universal background checks on firearms, and recreational marijuana. He also led the state through the response to unrest and riots after George Floyd's murder in 2020. Voters handed Democrats narrow control of the state Senate in 2022, giving Walz a trifecta to kick off his second term and paving the wave for many of his achievements in St. Paul.\n\nVirtually unknown on the national stage, Walz has expanded his profile since being elected chair of the powerful Democratic Governors Association. Two former chairs, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, went on to become US presidents. Walz is also the co-chair of the Democratic National Convention's Rules Committee, which has put him in the middle of the fight over holding a virtual vote before the actual convention kicks off in Chicago on August 19.\n\nWalz's life has been shaped by rural America\n\nHarris' campaign is likely to tout Walz's biography as one that's similar to that of many Americans, especially in the Midwest.\n\nWalz grew up in rural Nebraska. At 17, he enlisted in the Army National Guard and spent 24 years in the Guard. He attended Chadron State College, a public university, before following in his father's footsteps and becoming a teacher. According to the Omaha World Herald, Walz's first teaching job was on the Pine Ridge Reservation, home to the Oglala Lakota tribe.\n\nWalz met his wife, Gwen, while teaching in Nebraska. The couple later moved to Minnesota. Walz has been open about how he and his wife needed in vitro fertilization in order to have children.\n\nWhen Walz launched his first run for Congress in 2005, he was still teaching high school. In 2006, he ousted Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht during a banner year for Democrats, who retook both houses in Congress as the nation turned against the war in Iraq.\n\nWalz represented his mostly rural district, which bordered Iowa, for six terms.\n\nAccording to GovTrack, Walz crafted a centrist record over his 12 years in Congress, likely a testament to a district that has conservative leanings. In 2018, Republicans won back the House seat.\n\nDuring Walz's five reelection campaigns, he boasted an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association, according to MinnPost. But when Walz ran for governor, he said his perspective on the issue had changed.\n\nWalz's selection gives the party a credible Midwestern voice at the highest level of Democratic politics, a major asset as the campaign sees victories in Michigan and Wisconsin as a core part of its electoral calculus in November.\n\nWhile Republicans are poised to win most rural locales across the Midwest, Democrats aren't giving up on those areas. If the Harris-Walz ticket can dominate in urban areas while also winning smaller cities and tamping down the GOP's rural margins, they have a chance to perform at levels not seen since President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_l_dorman@businessinsider.nl", "name": "John L.

Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\nAs a former House member and a second-term governor, Walz brings moderate views that could appeal to working-class voters in key battleground states, along with executive experience that would aid Harris in governing if she wins the presidency. Walz coined the now-popular term \"weird\" to describe the Trump-Vance ticket.\n\nShapiro, a popular governor from a critical swing state with 19 electoral votes who has been mentioned as a potential first Jewish president since his 2022 gubernatorial campaign, was seen as a formidable choice for Democrats.\n\nBut a campaign by pro-Palestinian activists and progressives to keep him off the ticket because of his stance on Israel and the campus protests gained steam in recent days. It fueled accusations that antisemitism derailed his nomination. Sen John Fetterman, an outspoken supporter of Israel and Pennsylvania's junior senator, also reportedly expressed his concern about picking Shapiro.\n\nCommentators described Walz as a safe no-harm pick who could help Harris gain ground with traditionally Democratic voters who were disillusioned with Biden over his position on the war in Gaza.\n\nWhile compared to Harris, Shapiro and Kelly, Walz has no direct Jewish connections, American Jews will overwhelmingly vote for the Democratic nominee, as they have historically.\n\nProgressives who cast \"uncommitted\" in the Democratic primaries this spring indicated they would be happier if Walz was picked. They pointed to his remarks on CNN after 19% of the Democratic electorate in the state's presidential primary participated in the protest vote. \"They are asking to be heard and that's what they should be doing,\" Walz said. \"Their message is clear that they think this is an intolerable situation and that we can do more. And I think the president is hearing that.\"\n\nAfter the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Walz ordered state flags to be flown at half-mast and criticized those who did not condemn the attack. \"If you did not find moral clarity on Saturday morning, and you find yourself waiting to think about what you needed to say, you need to reevaluate where you're at,\" Walz said at a vigil held at Congregation Beth El in Minneapolis.\n\nIn early March, Walz endorsed calls for a permanent \"working\" ceasefire, just days after Harris drew praise from the progressive base by calling for an \"immediate\" six-week ceasefire in a speech in Selma, Alabama.\n\nWalz, a retired Army officer, visited Israel and the occupied West Bank in 2009 on a diplomatic tour to the Middle East, during which he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He said he told the Israelis he believed that the growing number of Jewish settlements in the West Bank were hampering the prospects for peace.\n\nWalz spoke at the annual AIPAC policy conference in 2010 amid tension between the Israeli government and the Obama administration over the construction of settlements in East Jerusalem. \"Especially now when there is a little tension in the relationship, it's important to hear what people are thinking,\" he said, according to the Minnesota Post. \"Israel is our truest and closest ally in the region, with a commitment to values of personal freedoms and liberties, surrounded by a pretty tough neighborhood.\"\n\nWalz voted with his party in favor of aid to Israel and supported the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Earlier this year, he faced protests over his state's pension funds investments in Israel bonds.\n\n\"We are committed to confronting hate and bias crimes, and recognize that antisemitism represents a unique and millennia-old enduring hatred of Jewish people,\" Walz said in a 2019 proclamation marking the first anniversary of the deadly attack at the Tree of Life synagogue, which killed 11 worshippers in the deadliest act of antisemitism in the nation's history.\n\nIn April, Walz condemned the hostility toward Jewish students at the pro-Palestinian campus protests. \"I think when Jewish students are telling us they feel unsafe in that, we need to believe them, and I do believe them,\" he said on a local PBS program.\n\nSpeaking at an annual event by Minnesota's Jewish Community Relations Council, Walz called for strengthening Holocaust education and ethnic studies in his state's school system.\n\nDuring his reelection campaign, Walz decried his Republican opponent, Scott Jensen, comparing COVID policies to the Holocaust. Walz called on Jensen to apologize for the \"hurtful and dangerous\" comments.", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Since then, she has gathered enough delegates to be her party's nominee, raised hundreds of millions of dollars and recast the race against Republican Donald Trump with a boost of energy from her party's base.\n\nHarris is expected to appear with her running mate at an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening. Her selection will demonstrate her thinking about her best pathway to winning the presidency and show who she believes would serve as an effective governing partner should she prevail against Trump.\n\nShapiro, 51, is a rising star in the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes make it a must-win state for both Harris and Trump.\n\nWalz, 60, serves as governor in a solidly Democratic state but has proven appeal to rural, white voters, who in recent years have voted broadly for Trump.\n\nAmericans typically focus on the person at the top of the ticket when choosing whom to vote for, but vice presidential candidates can help or hurt their running mates based on their backgrounds, home state popularity and ability to sway important constituencies or independent voters.\n\nTrump's vice presidential pick, U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has had a rocky start since joining the Republican ticket, with old comments criticizing \"childless cat ladies\" drawing unwelcome attention and potentially alienating women voters.\n\nVance will follow Harris and her new running mate to several swing states this week, the Trump campaign said, including stops in South Philadelphia on Tuesday and Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday. He plans to criticize Harris on economic issues and immigration.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Nandita Bose; additional reporting by Nathan Layne; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Stephen Coates)",

Since then, she has gathered enough delegates to be her party's nominee, raised hundreds of millions of dollars and recast the race against Republican Donald Trump with a boost of energy from her party's base.\n\nHarris is expected to appear with her running mate at an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening. Her selection will demonstrate her thinking about her best pathway to winning the presidency and show who she believes would serve as an effective governing partner should she prevail against Trump.\n\nShapiro, 51, is a rising star in the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes make it a must-win state for both Harris and Trump.\n\nWalz, 60, serves as governor in a solidly Democratic state but has proven appeal to rural, white voters, who in recent years have voted broadly for Trump.\n\nAmericans typically focus on the person at the top of the ticket when choosing whom to vote for, but vice presidential candidates can help or hurt their running mates based on their backgrounds, home state popularity and ability to sway important constituencies or independent voters.\n\nTrump's vice presidential pick, U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has had a rocky start since joining the Republican ticket, with old comments criticizing \"childless cat ladies\" drawing unwelcome attention and potentially alienating women voters.\n\nVance will follow Harris and her new running mate to several swing states this week, the Trump campaign said, including stops in South Philadelphia on Tuesday and Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday. He plans to criticize Harris on economic issues and immigration.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Nandita Bose; additional reporting by Nathan Layne; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Stephen Coates)",

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.\n\nShapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the center than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer who exudes folksy charm, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as \"weird\" gaining enormous traction.\n\nOther less likely contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a longstanding friend of Harris; and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nHarris threw her hat in the ring and began her search for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden exited the race on July 21.\n\nHe had been facing mounting concerns over his low popularity ratings and advanced years, and Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presiding over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Harris's rise continuing unabated ever since, with a Morning Consult survey notably placing her four points ahead of Trump nationally, 48 to 44 percent.\n\nBut a new CBS News poll found Harris's popularity among Black voters some way behind Biden's score as he defeated Trump in 2020, prompting some senior Democrats to caution against complacency.\n\n\"She has a lot of momentum, but if you do look at the polling, this is still a really tight race,\" Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod told political outlet The Hill. \"This is going to be a hard fight

Here's how the process worked\n\nDemocratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\nGovernment-politics Civil Rights Movement Freedom Riders urge younger activists to get out the vote CHARLOTTE KRAMON Associated Press/Report for America\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nElections Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' race as he appears at gathering of Black journalists By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nElections Russia is relying on unwitting Americans to spread election disinformation, officials say DAVID KLEPPER Associated Press\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on

Tim Walz as Running Mate in 2024 Presidential Bid", "body": "Hamptons Film Festival to Open With R.J. Cutler's Martha Stewart Documentary (Exclusive)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate in her 2024 presidential bid, according to multiple reports.\n\nAhead of the decision being officially announced by the VP on X (formerly Twitter), CNN, The Hill and The Associated Press all reported, per multiple sources, Walz as her pick early on Tuesday morning.\n\nHarris, who secured enough votes from delegates to become the Democratic nominee for president via a virtual event on Friday, officially entered the 2024 presidential race after President Joe Biden ended his own re-election bid on July 21 in a surprise announcement after weeks of calls to drop out following the 81-year-old's poor performance in a debate against former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president.\n\nBiden swiftly endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee and she quickly gained support from prominent Democratic figures like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, becoming the first woman to serve as a major party's presidential nominee; former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer; House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; Senator Elizabeth Warren; and Governors Gavin Newsom, of California, and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan; as well as Hollywood figures like Aaron Sorkin, Barbra Streisand and George Clooney, who penned a headline-making column in The New York Times earlier in July calling on Biden to drop out and saying that the president's condition in a recent fundraiser was similar to how he seemed in the much-maligned debate.\n\nHarris had been considering a number of contenders to serve as her vice president should she win in November. The politicians under serious consideration, according to multiple reports, in the days leading up to her announcement, included Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper had been seen as a possible running mate but withdrew his name from consideration, it was revealed last week, due to concerns about regularly traveling out of state.\n\nHarris was reportedly interviewing the leading contenders over the weekend, with Shapiro, Walz and Kelly considered to be the frontrunners according to various reports, including the Associated Press, NY Times and Axios.\n\nOn Tuesday, she was set to appear with her running mate at a Philadelphia fundraiser, which will launch a tour of multiple battleground states ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from Aug. 19-22.\n\nWalz, 60, spent 12 years in the House of Representatives, where he was well-respected and forged strong relationships with fellow legislators before being elected to Minnesota governor in 2018. His characterization of Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, as \"weird,\" was quickly picked up by Harris and other Democrats.\n\nThe former teacher and football coach has enacted progressive legislation in Minnesota like universal school lunches and laying the groundwork to get the state to 100 percent clean energy by 2040. And he signed a law that would seemingly be appreciated by Taylor Swift fans: House File 1989 that provides more transparency and protection for people buying tickets online for concerts, sports and other live events in Minnesota, prompted by the frustration felt by a local legislator and numerous other fans, trying to buy tickets to Swift's concerts.\n\nThough Trump is reportedly still trying to flip Minnesota, the state went for the Democratic presidential candidate in both 2016 and 2020, so it's less of a swing state than places like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Bernie Sanders and United Auto Workers boss Shawn Fain have also backed Walz.\n\nDemocrats moved to have their presidential candidate nominated virtually, ahead of the convention, due to an Aug. 7 deadline to ensure candidates appear on the Ohio ballot. The online voting process ends on Monday.\n\nThere will still be a state-by-state roll call at the convention, but this will be purely ceremonial.\n\nHarris will be the first woman of color atop a major party's ticket and, if she wins, the first female president in U.S. history.\n\nHarris' campaign has generated a new level of excitement for Democrats, as reflected in memes, star-studded Zooms that have seen record-breaking attendance and crowded rallies, like one in Atlanta last week, where Megan Thee Stallion stumped (and danced and rapped) for Harris. On Friday it was revealed that her campaign raised $310 million in July, more than Trump raised over the same period and giving her campaign the most cash on hand for any presidential candidate at this point in the cycle, according to the Associated Press. This comes after a number of top donors said they were withholding presidential campaign contributions in the wake of Biden's debate performance.\n\nTrump has selected Ohio Senator Vance as his vice presidential candidate, announcing the pick on July 15, the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and just two days after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilary_lewis@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Hilary Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martha Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. If those names are unfamiliar to you, count yourself among the majority of Americans who don't know or have never heard of the Democrats who could be the next vice president, according to an NPR/PBS News Marist poll.\n\nThe survey found Kelly has the highest favorability of the three candidates for the No. 2 job in the White House, 31% favorable to 18% unfavorable, but 52% of respondents still said they were unsure or have never heard of him.\n\nShapiro, who is speculated to be the front-runner in the veepstakes since Harris will make her first appearance with her running mate in Philadelphia, has a 25%-23% favorable to unfavorable rating. Still, 53% of Americans are unsure.\n\nHarris is scheduled to announce her selection at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening.\n\nThis will be Harris' first visit to Pennsylvania as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, after formerly securing the nomination on Monday. The trip also marks her seventh visit to the commonwealth this year and the 17th since she was sworn in as vice president in 2021.\n\nKelly, Shapiro and Walz are the finalists for the VP job in a truncated vetting process after President Biden shocked the nation by dropping out of the 2024 race and endorsed Harris to succeed him.\n\nHarris was in Washington, D.C., over the weekend conducting in-person interviews with her potential running mates, Democratic sources confirmed to Fox News. Others under consideration include Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and JB Pritzker of Illinois, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nAhead of her meetings with the contenders, Harris was briefed by a vetting team led by former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe rollout of the announcement is not known, but it's likely it could come through a video introduction, similar to how Biden announced Harris as his running mate four years ago. But the Harris campaign's plans could be upended on Monday or Tuesday by a media leak of the announcement.\n\nAfter the rally in Philadelphia, Harris and her to-be-named running mate will team for an ambitious and jam-packed swing state tour through Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, the seven battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nThe vice president drew over 10,000 at her first major rally since taking over for Biden at the top of the Democrats' ticket, last week at the Georgia State Convocation Center in Atlanta.\n\nHarris will be shadowed on her tour by Republican candidate for vice president JD Vance, forces confirmed to Fox News. The Ohio senator will act as the Trump campaign's attack dog, attempting to persuade voters against Harris in key swing states.\n\nFox News Digital's Paul Steinhauser and Landon Mion contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Convocation_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State Convocation Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz continues to garner attention on social media, with many people posting about how the Democratic governor has \"big dad energy\" and making wholesome jokes about him.\n\nPeople have taken to social media to talk about how Walz is the Midwestern dad everyone needs right now. Here are some of the best Midwest dad-isms out there:\n\nWes Burdine (@MnNiceFC) posted on X: \"Kamala, in the Oval Office: 'General, what do you think our response time should be?' *Walz stands up, walks over to the window, distracting everyone * General: 'Mr Vice President?'

Walz's \"big dad energy\" is also getting attention on TikTok.\n\nThis list will be updated as FOX 9 discovers more \"big dad energy\" gems. If you have a favorite, email them to melissa.turtinen@fox.com.\n\nWalz has been routinely mentioned as a possible running mate pick for Harris. In the weeks since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race for president, Walz has been campaigning for Harris as the Democratic nominee and next president -- and drawing a lot of attention while doing it despite not having much of a national profile.\n\nIn the hours after Biden dropped out, Walz was on the phone with Harris. He wouldn't quite say what the conversation was about but he enthusiastically praised the vice president, especially for her groundbreaking appearance in St. Paul when she became the first sitting VP or President to visit an abortion clinic.\n\nThe second-term DFL governor got a boost from social media and has created excitement after a series of appearances on national networks, including FOX News. Walz drew support from Democrats while making headlines and going viral for his comments, including starting the Harris campaign's \"weird\" attack line against former President Trump and JD Vance.\n\nIt's unclear where Walz stands on the list to be Harris' running mate though. He did cancel his plans to travel to New Hampshire to campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris over the weekend, as Harris reportedly interviews her potential running mates this weekend. And last week, Walz responded to questions from reporters on whether he could be the Harris VP pick.\n\n\"I'm not interviewing for anything, I am who I am,\" Gov. Walz said. \"I don't know if every high school geography teacher expects to be in this position at some point.\"\n\nThat being said, Minnesota DFL lawmakers have endorsed Walz to be Harris' running mate.", "source": {"uri": "fox5ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMSP-TV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KMSP-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2024/08/1280/720/walz-BDE.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788903", "eventUri": "eng-9788903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for specifics.\n\nShapiro is extremely popular in Pennsylvania, the largest of the six or seven swing states that have determined recent US elections, and is viewed as giving Harris an advantage in what is considered must-win territory for both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket that already includes the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis backing for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian rallies has provoked a leftist response, and Democrats want to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago is not tarnished by progressive and anti-Israel protesters.\n\nShapiro's supporters have stated that the criticism is based on anti-Semitism, and many experts feel that his moderate stance wins him more votes from the center than it loses to the progressive extreme.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer with a folksy appeal, would provide a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is perceived as belonging to the liberal half of the party.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has established himself as one of the Democrats' most successful communicators, with his critique of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as \"weird\" finding significant resonance.\n\nOther less likely candidates are Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Harris' longtime buddy; and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nHarris put her hat in the ring and began looking for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden dropped out of the campaign on July 21.\n\nHe had been facing rising concerns about his low popularity ratings and elderly age, but Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presided over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Harris's climb continuing unabated since, with a Morning Consult survey putting her four points ahead of Trump nationally, 48 to 44%.\n\nHowever, a new CBS News poll revealed Harris's support among Black voters to be significantly lower than Biden's when he defeated Trump in 2020, prompting several prominent Democrats to warn against complacency.\n\n\"She has a lot of momentum, but if you do look at the polling, this is still a really tight race,\" Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod told political outlet The Hill. \"This is going to be a hard fight

He is seen as a strong candidate who can appeal to rural, white voters and has championed popular progressive policies.\n\nThe Harris campaign is expected to officially announce the name of the running mate in a few hours.\n\n'Weird dudes'\n\nWalz has also gained attention for his effective attacks on Donald Trump and JD Vance, which the Harris campaign has embraced.\n\nHe has over the past week delivered a handful of memorable haymakers against Republicans, though his most notable contribution has been a determination to label the GOP, especially its presidential ticket of former President Donald Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance.\n\nWalz has referred to the duo as \"weird dudes\".\n\nThe phrase has stuck, becoming a central meme in the new, post-Biden version of the campaign, a development that is delighting Democrats and apparently frustrating many on the right.\n\nA strategic pick\n\nThe selection of Walz is seen as a strategic move to boost the Democratic ticket's chances in key battleground states like Wisconsin and Michigan. Minnesota, while solidly Democratic, is close to these crucial swing states.\n\nWalz's down-to-earth style and lived experiences that are comparable to many in rural America have helped him connect with ordinary Americans.\n\nHe has a proven track record of winning elections in Republican-leaning districts and defending his seat as governor.\n\nThe choice of Walz is expected to energise the Democratic base and provide a strong contrast to the Republican ticket.\n\nHarris will begin a tour of battleground states with her new running mate later in the week. On Tuesday, Harris is expected to address a rally in Philadelphia alongside her running mate.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nInterim superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools left previous job under fire Vatican rejects appeals to save two Catholic parishes in St. Louis A beloved South Grand convenience store employee was killed by customer, witnesses say Michael Siani's injury will throw open range of options in center field: Cardinals Extra Videos show CVPA shooter stalking hallways before police storm the St. Louis school McClellan: Maybe Outsiders aren't the answer for St. Louis Man claims to be editor of St. Louis' Riverfront Times, defends site's OnlyFans content Transgender woman's use of locker room at Ellisville gym sparks outcry from conservatives Firm with ties to Indian tech execs made $1.5 million donation to Missouri treasurer BenFred: Hey, maybe we weren't crazy for thinking Caitlin Clark should have made Team USA Editorial: Our endorsements in Missouri's GOP and Democratic gubernatorial primaries St. Louis restaurant openings and closings for July St. Louis County overpaid dozens of employees for years. Some had already quit. Sultan: What J.D. Vance's obsession with childless cat women is really about Target plans another location in St. Louis County\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "seung_min_kim@stltoday.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "zeke_miller@stltoday.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverfront_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverfront Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Public_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Public Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

(Scripps News)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is expected to name her running mate on Tuesday as she begins a tour of battleground states with her pick.\n\nHarris will be in Philadelphia on Tuesday for a rally at 5:30 p.m. Who she takes the stage with remains unknown, as of Tuesday morning.\n\nHer event comes one day after she officially became the party's nominee following days of virtual voting by delegates.\n\nThree contenders have emerged as her likely running mate: Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\nThe battleground tour is also expected to include stops in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Among the seven states Harris and her soon-to-be-named running mate will visit, six were narrowly won by President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nRELATED STORY | President Biden to give address on first night of Democratic National Convention, sources say\n\nBiden won Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia by less than 3%. Then President Donald Trump won North Carolina by 1.4%.\n\nHarris spent time interviewing each of the three vice presidential picks over the weekend.\n\nBeing from the swing state with the most electoral votes up for grabs, Shapiro could provide a favorable boost for Harris. He's only been in office since the start of last year but is a popular figure as he is Pennsylvania's highest vote-getter in gubernatorial history after winning the 2022 election by 15 percentage points.\n\nKelly, a retired astronaut, has served as a Democratic senator for the swing state of Arizona since taking over Sen. John McCain's seat in 2020. Kelly has deep ties to the military, having served in the U.S. Navy as a combat pilot. He is married to former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords.\n\nAnother contender, Walz, has deep Midwestern roots and a solid political resume. He became governor of Minnesota in 2019 and navigated the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the public outcry following the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer.\n\nAs Harris hits the campaign trail on Tuesday, she will be tailed by Trump's running mate Sen. JD Vance. Vance is holding an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "kxxv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KXXV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz said to be picked by Harris as her running mate * Michigan Advance", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday, in a move meant to boost the Democratic ticket's appeal in key Midwestern states and with blue-collar voters, according to media reports by CNN, Bloomberg and others.\n\nWalz, a former social studies teacher and Army National Guard veteran who won challenging elections in a rural U.S. House district before running for governor in 2018 and winning reelection in 2022, balances Harris geographically and demographically, while bringing a history of campaign wins in purple-to-red areas and a governing record among the most progressive of any contender to join the ticket.\n\nWalz was seen as the preferred vice presidential pick of the party's progressive wing, especially as an alternative to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Harris interviewed both governors, and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, in Washington Sunday as she whittled down her shortlist.\n\nLittle known until recently outside his home state to all but the closest political observers, Walz's laid-back style and approachable demeanor -- and straightforward attacks on Republican rivals Donald Trump and J.D. Vance -- over weeks of consistent national TV appearances won praise from Democratic officials and strategists who have struggled to break Trump's hold over white voters without college degrees.\n\nWalz, 60, emerged in recent weeks as one of the party's top communicators through the power of a single adjective for Republicans and their policy goals.\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" Walz said in a July 23 interview on MSNBC. \"They want to take books away, they want to be in your exam room ... These are weird ideas.\"\n\nDespite the best efforts of President Joe Biden's abandoned reelection bid to describe Republicans under Trump's leadership as a threat to U.S. democracy and reproductive rights who couldn't be trusted to responsibly govern, the attacks didn't stick and Trump continued to climb in the polls.\n\nBut shortly after Biden's July 21 exit from the race, Democrats embraced the succinct message that has been credited to the Minnesota governor.\n\n\"I am loving Tim Walz on TV,\" Rebecca Pearcey, a Democratic strategist, told States Newsroom in a July interview on potential vice presidential picks for Harris.\n\n\"I love that he's just so down-to-earth and so pithy and that he's like, 'These guys are weird,'\" she added. \"That's exactly it -- we are overcomplicating what this message has to be.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in a rural community in Nebraska, has slammed national Republicans for a relentless focus on cultural issues. He's trained that criticism recently on Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio whose rise to Republican vice presidential nominee was built on his controversial book detailing the lives of people in impoverished rural areas of Kentucky.\n\nVance and Republicans have \"obsessions\" with taking away rights, Walz has said, especially related to reproductive rights and education that includes discussion of gender and sexuality.\n\n\"The golden rule that makes small towns work so we're not at each other's throats all the time in a little town is: Mind your own damn business,\" Walz told MSNBC's Jen Psaki on July 25. \"I don't need him (Vance) to tell me about my family, I don't need him to tell me about my wife's health care and her reproductive rights, I don't need him telling my children what books to read.\"\n\nWalz instead projects a pragmatic vision of Democratic governance.\n\n\"They scream socialism, we just build roads and we build schools and we build prosperity into this,\" he told Psaki.\n\nAs governor, Walz has notched a series of policy wins he can boast to the party's progressive wing about. He signed laws to offer free meals to all public school students, expand abortion access and legalize some recreational uses of THC.\n\nBut the bespectacled former high school teacher and football coach, who has donned t-shirts and hunting caps in national TV hits, also projects an image of Midwestern pragmatism.\n\nThat may help balance voters' views of a Democratic ticket led by Harris, who would be the first woman president, the first president of South Asian descent and the second Black president, and who is seen as more liberal than most in the party after climbing the ranks through Democratic primaries in California.\n\nChristopher Devine, a political scientist at the University of Dayton, said Walz's appeal is not unlike that of Harris' last running mate.\n\n\"Walz has a message that kind of reminds me of Joe Biden's appeal, kind of a working-class focus,\" he said. \"He can speak from a rural background, he's been a teacher and a coach and has a military background as well. He seems to me like he's someone who could maybe help with kind of a working-class message.\"\n\nThe campaign will depend on Walz to carry that message to neighboring Wisconsin and other crucial Rust Belt states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.", "source": {"uri": "michiganadvance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Michigan Advance"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_fischler@michiganadvance.com", "name": "Jacob Fischler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Here's what we know", "body": "Weird that someone from one of the nation's most reliable Democratic states is on the presidential ticket. And \"weird\" being the Democratic catchphrase of the year so far, thanks to Walz.\n\nHe used the word last month during an MSNBC interview to describe Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance, and it's caught on among other Democrats.\n\nWalz, who media outlets reported Wednesday will be Kamala Harris's pick for vice president, brings to the Democratic ticket both a Midwestern folksiness but also an ability to twist rhetorical knives into opponents.\n\nHow much Walz will help the ticket of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who officially named Walz her running mate Monday, is uncertain.\n\nMinnesota is probably not a state that needs help to vote Democratic. It last gave its electoral votes to a Republican in 1972. It may be adjacent geographically to swing state Wisconsin, but that state's political leanings have not reliably spilled into the other over the years.\n\nHe also doesn't bring the sort of generational change that Vance, 39, adds to the GOP ticket. Walz is 60, six months younger than Harris.\n\nWhat he does bring, in addition to his style, is a command of issues. He's the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, where he has been an outspoken critic of Republican policy. Progressives appreciate his championing of social service reforms such as paid family leave.\n\n\"We have a saying in Minnesota: 'If you do something good and talk about it, it no longer counts,''' Walz told Politico last year. In President Joe Biden's case, \" I think there was a slowness to talk about the things they did.\"\n\nGovernor of Minnesota since 2019, Walz has been both a political insider and outsider.\n\nHe spent the early part of his adult life as a teacher in China, then in Nebraska, where he met his wife, and Minnesota. He helped coach the Monkato, Minn., football team in 1999 to the high school's first championship.\n\nHe spent 24 years in the Army National Guard, retiring in 2005.\n\nWalz then began his political career, winning a House seat in 2006 in a rural Minnesota district with strong Republican leanings. He nonetheless proved to be a reliable Democrat on abortion, labor, fiscal issues and other major policies.\n\nAs governor, Walz has generally stuck to those policies. He won his first term with 53% of the vote and his second term in 2022 with 52%.

Tim Walz as her VP", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nHarris could have potentially given herself a leg up in one of the seven swing states that decide the election. No state or potential running mate loomed larger than Pennsylvania and its governor, Josh Shapiro. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona was also reportedly a finalist as well.\n\nBut progressives and some party activists made clear they were less than thrilled with either man.\n\nShapiro faced intense scrutiny over his views of the war in Gaza. He has been critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he also previously compared some pro-Palestinian protesters to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nKey voices in the labor movement also grumbled about Shapiro and Kelly. Shapiro, despite having the backing of some unions in his state, alienated progressives over his past support for school vouchers. Kelly was viewed suspiciously after only offering a belated endorsement of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, Democrats' sweeping proposal to boost union power.\n\nWalz faced no such opposition. Despite being virtually unknown on the national stage, the Minnesota Democrat vaulted into contention with a series of media appearances. In one appearance, Walz helped pioneer the party's decision to label former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, \"weird.\"\n\nA former NRA-endorsed congressman, Walz has reinvented himself as a progressive governor who has overseen the passage of a raft of liberal priorities to become law thanks to Democrats' trifecta in state government. Under Walz, Minnesota has passed universal free school lunches and universal background checks on firearms. Recreational marijuana is legal. And abortion rights are enshrined in law. It's a record that leading progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont love.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to talk to your governor a few days ago and I am very impressed by him,\" Sanders said Saturday in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio. \"I think you have an excellent governor who understands the needs of working families.\"\n\nHarris has still taken risks in trying to keep the peace. Walz's home state of Minnesota is nowhere near as competitive as Pennsylvania or Arizona. And like the other reported finalists, Walz is barely known on the national stage.\n\nBeyond the \"weird\" label, Walz has shown he will enthusiastically embrace the vice presidential running mate's traditional role in leading the attack. Drawing on his rural Nebraska roots, Walz said Vance doesn't truly understand small-town America.\n\n\"What I know is that people like JD Vance know nothing about small town America,\" Walz recently told MSNBC. \"My town had 400 people in it, 2,400 kids in my graduating class, 12 were cousins, and he gets it all wrong. It's not about hate. It's not about collapsing in. The golden rule is mind your own damn business. Their policies are what have destroyed rural America.\"\n\nLike Vance, Walz served in the military. Unlike the Ohio Republican, Walz has far more experience in elected office. Vance, who could be the nation's first millennial vice president, has served just roughly 18 months in the US Senate. Walz served six terms in Congress before running for governor.\n\nWalz won't be alone, either. The first big event featuring the Democratic presidential ticket is in Philadelphia, and Shapiro may even be on hand.\n\nHarris decided that tapping Pennsylvania's popular lead was too big of a risk. But she'll need all the help she can get in the state that is likely to determine the entire race.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brent_d_griffiths@businessinsider.com", "name": "Brent D.

Tim Walz as running mate, aiming to add Midwest muscle to ticket", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nHarris wins Democratic nomination in virtual roll call. Here's how the process worked By ROBERT YOON - Associated Press\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nElections Trump is making his 2024 campaign about Harris' race, whether Republicans want him to or not By STEVE PEOPLES and MATT BROWN Associated Press\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\nCrime-courts Civil Rights Movement Freedom Riders urge younger activists to get out the vote CHARLOTTE KRAMON Associated Press/Report for America\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nElections Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' race as he appears at gathering of Black journalists By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nElections Russia is relying on unwitting Americans to spread election disinformation, officials say DAVID KLEPPER Associated Press\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "nwitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nwi.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zeke_miller@nwitimes.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@nwitimes.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Midwest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore, File)\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked. The people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been announced\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will be yet another milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states. They'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby 's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.\n\nShapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the center than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer who exudes folksy charm, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D.

This decision comes amidst growing speculation and debate about potential candidates, including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nAccording to an AP report quoting sources, Harris will formally introduce Walz as her running mate at a rally scheduled for Tuesday evening in Philadelphia. She officially claimed the nomination on Monday night after the Democratic National Committee (DNC) released the final results.\n\nThe choice of Walz marks a notable shift from the initial buzz surrounding Shapiro, who had garnered considerable support following President Joe Biden's announcement on July 21 that he would not seek a second term. Shapiro, a popular Democratic figure and first-term Governor of Pennsylvania, had been actively endorsed by state leaders and had campaigned vigorously for Harris, making him a prominent contender for the Vice Presidential spot.\n\nWalz, who has served as Minnesota's Governor since 2019, has emerged as a key figure in Harris's campaign strategy. Known for his focus on progressive policies and bipartisan cooperation, Walz's selection is seen as a strategic move to bolster the ticket's appeal across diverse voter bases.\n\nDuring his tenure, Walz has been recognized for his leadership on various issues, including education reform, healthcare access, and economic development. His record as a former high school teacher and veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard has resonated with many voters, positioning him as a relatable and effective choice for Harris's running mate.\n\nThe announcement of Walz as Harris's running mate highlights the campaign's emphasis on expanding its reach and appealing to a broad spectrum of voters.

Harris is expected to unveil Walz at a rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania later this afternoon.\n\nWalz was on a shortlist of potential running mates that also included Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nWalz, 60, was one of the lesser-known vice presidential contenders, but he exploded into the public eye when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month. On social media, Gen Z activists introduced Walz to their younger audience, some calling him \"the mid-western dad we need as VP.\"\n\nDemocrats hope Walz can help Harris whittle down the margins in battleground states like Wisconsin and Michigan. His folksy manner, casual dress style, small town background, and ability to talk to skeptical midwesterners are seen as assets for the progressive, coastal Harris.\n\nAt the outset of his career, the two-term governor and former congressman initially presented himself as a moderate. But over time, Walz has increasingly leaned Left and implemented a sweeping progressive agenda.\n\nAs governor, Walz signed a bill allowing illegal migrants to get driver's licenses, and gave more than 55,000 formerly incarcerated people the ability to vote again. He also signed legislation legalizing recreational marijuana, tightening gun laws, making abortion a \"fundamental right,\" and preserving legal transgender medical interventions for children.\n\nWalz was governor when the violent George Floyd riots swept Minneapolis. The riots resulted in at least two deaths, more than 600 arrests, and more than $500 million in property damage to hundreds of businesses. Afterward, the city's police force hemorrhaged officers.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR 'AM I RACIST?' -- A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI\n\nDuring the COVID pandemic, Walz declared a peacetime state of emergency, forcing schools and restaurants to close and mandating masks indoors. Republicans slammed Walz for his stringent COVID restrictions, as well as the state's nursing home deaths. They also accused him of refusing to build relationships with them, unlike other Democrat governors.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, a conservative group sued over Walz's mask mandate, arguing that Walz had made a power grab and that the law allowing the emergency declaration was unconstitutional. They lost their case in the spring.\n\nWalz is a veteran of the Army National Guard, where he served for 24 years. He also coached high school football and taught social studies before he was elected to Congress in 2006 as a Democrat in a red district. He was first elected governor in 2018 and shares two children with his wife, Gwen Whipple, a fellow teacher.\n\nIn recent weeks, Walz has frequently appeared on television to slam the Trump-Vance ticket, saying, \"These guys are just weird,\" during a recent MSNBC appearance.\n\nNotably, former President Donald Trump also chose a midwesterner as his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance.",

Tim Walz as running mate, aiming to add Midwest muscle to ticket", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid preempting the official announcenment later Tuesday.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest.

Some speculated that Shapiro would be picked after the Harris campaign told Politico she would stage her first rally with her running mate in Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nJournalist and editor Graham Starr first reported on X that Shapiro's Wikipedia page has seen dozens of edits, while Walz and Kelly have seen few. Though this phenomenon could indicate a future VP pick, as it has done in the past, many of the edits to Shapiro's page concerned criticism he received regarding past remarks about Palestinians and his stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nWalz, meanwhile, is a favorite among labor advocates.

Since then, she has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and recast the race against Republican Donald Trump with a boost of energy from her party's base.\n\nAlthough she had gathered enough delegates to be her party's nominee, the Democratic National Committee said late on Monday that she had officially secured the nomination.\n\nMs Harris is expected to appear with her running mate at an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening. Her selection will demonstrate her thinking about her best pathway to winning the presidency and show who she believes would serve as an effective governing partner should she prevail against Mr Trump.\n\nMr Shapiro (51) is a rising star in the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes make it a must-win state for both Ms Harris and Mr Trump.\n\nMr Walz (60) serves as governor in a solidly Democratic state but has proven appeal to rural, white voters, who in recent years have voted broadly for Mr Trump.\n\nAmericans typically focus on the person at the top of the ticket when choosing whom to vote for, but vice-presidential candidates can help or hurt their running mates based on their backgrounds, home state popularity and ability to sway important constituencies or independent voters.\n\nMr Trump's vice presidential pick, US senator JD Vance of Ohio, has had a rocky start since joining the Republican ticket, with old comments criticising \"childless cat ladies\" drawing unwelcome attention and potentially alienating women voters.\n\nMr Vance will follow Ms Harris and her new running mate to several swing states this week, the Trump campaign said, including stops in South Philadelphia on Tuesday and Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday. He plans to criticise Harris on economic issues and immigration. - Reuters", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"Vice-President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday morning, ending two weeks of intense speculation as the US hurtles towards November's presidential election.\n\nMs Harris interviewed several top contenders in Washington DC over the weekend, including Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly.\n\nHer choice will join her on a whirlwind five-day tour of seven cities this week as Ms Harris ramps up her campaign in key battleground states.\n\nThe most recent poll from CBS, the BBC's US partner, shows Ms Harris and Trump in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over her Republican challenger.\n\nThe poll released on Sunday shows Trump and Ms Harris tied in battleground states, where the former president held a five-point lead while Joe Biden remained in the race.\n\nFollowing the announcement expected on Tuesday morning, a campaign video will be released before Ms Harris and her new running mate jointly hold a rally in Philadelphia that evening.\n\nShe reportedly met her vetting team - led by former US attorney general Eric Holder - over the weekend and received in-depth presentations on their findings, including potential political vulnerabilities.\n\nShe met three of those candidates - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - on Sunday.\n\nShe also met another top contender - Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - on Friday and is understood to have spoken with other candidates virtually, US media report.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, in response to a report that Ms Harris had made her pick, a campaign spokesperson, Kevin Munoz, wrote on social media that she was still deciding.\n\n\"We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!\" he said.\n\nIt comes as the DNC finished a virtual roll call vote that saw Ms Harris officially become the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign.\n\nThe Harris campaign has met with a flurry of lobbying efforts on behalf of - or criticising - the candidates.\n\nMr Shapiro, for example, has drawn sharp opposition from some left-wing groups for his support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as well as his pro-Israel views.\n\nThe Philadelphia event will be followed by a string of campaign events across Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, before ending with a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10 August.\n\nTrump and his running mate, JD Vance, have both suggested that Ms Harris' choice of running mate will ultimately have no impact on the upcoming election.\n\nIn an episode of the \"Full Send\" podcast aired on Friday, Mr Vance said he believed the vice-presidential choice \"doesn't really matter, as much as this hits my ego\".\n\n\"People are going to vote primarily for Donald Trump or for Kamala Harris,\" he said. \"That's the way these things go.\"\n\nSimilarly, Trump has largely shrugged off questions about Ms Harris's choice, arguing last week that the vice-presidential role \"does not have any impact\".", "source": {"uri": "pmnewsnigeria.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pmnewsnigeria.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He then spent a year teaching abroad before returning home to serve full-time in the National Guard and teach high school, as well as accept a coaching position.\n\nWalz is married to Gwen Walz. They moved to Mankato, Minnesota, where they both worked at Mankato High School, where he taught social studies and helped coach the Mankato West football team.\n\nHe was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, representing Minnesota's First Congressional District, and was reelected for another five terms before running for governor of Minnesota.\n\nIn the weeks since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race for president, Walz has been campaigning for Harris as the Democratic nominee and next president -- and drawing a lot of attention while doing it despite not having much of a national profile.\n\nIn the hours after Biden dropped out, Walz was on the phone with Harris. He wouldn't quite say what the conversation was about but he enthusiastically praised the vice president, especially for her groundbreaking appearance in St. Paul when she became the first sitting VP or President to visit an abortion clinic.\n\nThe second-term DFL governor was seen as a dark horse early on but got a boost from social media and has created excitement after a series of appearances on national networks, including FOX News.\n\nWalz drew support from Democrats while making headlines and going viral for his comments, including starting the Harris campaign's \"weird\" attack line against former President Donald Trump and JD Vance. Those who support him have cited his experience passing liberal priorities in Minnesota, as well as his background as a teacher, coach and veteran of the National Guard.\n\nEven before Biden dropped out, some in Minnesota's Congressional Delegation said Walz would make a great vice president, including U.S. Sen. Tina Smith (she hasn't yet endorsed Walz for VP) and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum.\n\nHe's also drawn fire from Minnesota Republicans and Trump after being named to a \"short list\" for potential vice presidential candidates.\n\nIn an ABC News/Ipsos poll before Harris announced her running mate, found that about 9 in 10 U.S. adults don't know enough to have an opinion on Walz. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative.\n\nIf Harris and Walz are elected president and vice president, it sets off a chain of promotions in Minnesota, making Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan Minnesota's first female and first Native American governor, and state Sen. Bobby Jo Champion its first Black lieutenant governor.", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.

As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to announce her running mate, a new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that several of the top potential contenders for the role are largely unknown to voters.\n\nBy SEUNG MIN KIM, COLLEEN LONG, ZEKE MILLER and WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid preempting the official announcenment later Tuesday.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

announce her running mate", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday morning, ending two weeks of intense speculation as the US hurtles towards November's presidential election.\n\nMs Harris interviewed several top contenders in Washington DC over the weekend, including Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly.\n\nHer choice will join her on a whirlwind five-day tour of seven cities this week as Ms Harris ramps up her campaign in key battleground states.\n\nThe most recent poll from CBS, the BBC's US partner, shows Ms Harris and Trump in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over her Republican challenger.\n\nThe poll released on Sunday shows Trump and Ms Harris tied in battleground states, where the former president held a five-point lead while Joe Biden remained in the race.\n\nFollowing the announcement expected on Tuesday morning, a campaign video will be released before Ms Harris and her new running mate jointly hold a rally in Philadelphia that evening.\n\nShe reportedly met her vetting team - led by former US attorney general Eric Holder - over the weekend and received in-depth presentations on their findings, including potential political vulnerabilities.\n\nShe met three of those candidates - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - on Sunday.\n\nShe also met another top contender - Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - on Friday and is understood to have spoken with other candidates virtually, US media report.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, in response to a report that Ms Harris had made her pick, a campaign spokesperson, Kevin Munoz, wrote on social media that she was still deciding.\n\n\"We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!\" he said.\n\nIt comes as the DNC finished a virtual roll call vote that saw Ms Harris officially become the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign.\n\nThe Harris campaign has met with a flurry of lobbying efforts on behalf of - or criticizing - the candidates.\n\nShapiro, for example, has drawn sharp opposition from some left-wing groups for his support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as well as his pro-Israel views.\n\nThe Philadelphia event will be followed by a string of campaign events across Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, before ending with a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10 August.\n\nTrump and his running mate, JD Vance, have both suggested that Ms Harris' choice of running mate will ultimately have no impact on the upcoming election.\n\nIn an episode of the \"Full Send\" podcast aired on Friday, Vance said he believed the vice-presidential choice \"doesn't really matter, as much as this hits my ego\".\n\n\"People are going to vote primarily for Donald Trump or for Kamala Harris,\" he said. \"That's the way these things go.\"\n\nSimilarly, Trump has largely shrugged off questions about Ms Harris's choice, arguing last week that the vice-presidential role \"does not have any impact\".\n\nOn Sunday, however, Trump criticized Shapiro on Fox News, saying that Ms Harris could lose \"her little Palestinian base\" if she chose him.\n\nShapiro, who during his student days wrote in a college magazine that Palestinians were \"too battle-minded\", told reporters on Friday that he now supported a two-state solution. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) endorsed Walz over the weekend, saying he \"understands the needs of working families.\" United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain backed Walz and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear as the union's top two choices for the ticket. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) said Walz \"has all of the qualities that the vice president needs to balance out the ticket.\"\n\nIn picking Walz, Harris hands a win to progressive Democrats who opposed Shapiro over his support for Israel in the war against Hamas. Some Democrats expressed concern that Shapiro's Jewish faith would pose a political liability in battleground states like Michigan, whose large Muslim and Arab populations have hammered the Biden-Harris administration for supporting Israel against Hamas.\n\nWhile Harris may avoid blowback from the anti-Semitic wing of her party, Walz's policies as a blue state governor may not appeal to moderate voters in battleground states.\n\n\"One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness,\" Walz said at a \"White Dudes for Harris\" fundraiser last week.\n\nWalz, who served six terms in the House of Representatives, came under scrutiny over his response to both the coronavirus pandemic and riots in the wake of the death of George Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020.\n\nWalz waited days after riots in Minneapolis to call in the National Guard. By then, anti-police protesters had burned down a police station in Minneapolis and caused $500 million in damage.\n\nWalz signed a bill last year to restore voting rights to 55,000 convicted felons in Minnesota as part of an initiative to \"expand the right to vote.\" And Walz signed a bill last year to provide free college and health care to illegal immigrants, even as he raised taxes on

"Vice-President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday morning, ending two weeks of intense speculation as the US hurtles towards November's presidential election.\n\nMs Harris interviewed several top contenders in Washington DC over the weekend, including Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly.\n\nHer choice will join her on a whirlwind five-day tour of seven cities this week as Ms Harris ramps up her campaign in key battleground states.\n\nThe most recent poll from CBS, the BBC's US partner, shows Ms Harris and Trump in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over her Republican challenger.\n\nThe poll released on Sunday shows Trump and Ms Harris tied in battleground states, where the former president held a five-point lead while Joe Biden remained in the race.\n\nFollowing the announcement expected on Tuesday morning, a campaign video will be released before Ms Harris and her new running mate jointly hold a rally in Philadelphia that evening.\n\nShe reportedly met her vetting team - led by former US attorney general Eric Holder - over the weekend and received in-depth presentations on their findings, including potential political vulnerabilities.\n\nShe met three of those candidates - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - on Sunday.\n\nShe also met another top contender - Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - on Friday and is understood to have spoken with other candidates virtually, US media report.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, in response to a report that Ms Harris had made her pick, a campaign spokesperson, Kevin Munoz, wrote on social media that she was still deciding.\n\n\"We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!\" he said.\n\nIt comes as the DNC finished a virtual roll call vote that saw Ms Harris officially become the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign.\n\nThe Harris campaign has met with a flurry of lobbying efforts on behalf of - or criticising - the candidates.\n\nMr Shapiro, for example, has drawn sharp opposition from some left-wing groups for his support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as well as his pro-Israel views.\n\nThe Philadelphia event will be followed by a string of campaign events across Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, before ending with a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10 August.\n\nTrump and his running mate, JD Vance, have both suggested that Ms Harris' choice of running mate will ultimately have no impact on the upcoming election.\n\nIn an episode of the \"Full Send\" podcast aired on Friday, Mr Vance said he believed the vice-presidential choice \"doesn't really matter, as much as this hits my ego\".\n\n\"People are going to vote primarily for Donald Trump or for Kamala Harris,\" he said. \"That's the way these things go.\"\n\nSimilarly, Trump has largely shrugged off questions about Ms Harris's choice, arguing last week that the vice-presidential role \"does not have any impact\".\n\nOn Sunday, however, Trump criticised Mr Shapiro on Fox News, saying that Ms Harris could lose \"her little Palestinian base\" if she chooses him.\n\nMr Shapiro, who during his student days wrote in a college magazine that Palestinians were \"too battle minded\", told reporters on Friday that he now supported a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyJoyOnline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person",

As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to announce her running mate, a new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that several of the top potential contenders for the role are largely unknown to voters.\n\nBy SEUNG MIN KIM, COLLEEN LONG, ZEKE MILLER and WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid preempting the official announcenment later Tuesday.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response.

Tim Walz as running mate", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nPolitical Points\n\nGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and running mate J.D. Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch.

"body": "Vice-President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday morning, ending two weeks of intense speculation as the US hurtles towards November's presidential election.\n\nMs Harris interviewed several top contenders in Washington DC over the weekend, including Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly.\n\nThe most recent poll from CBS, the BBC's US partner, shows Ms Harris and Trump in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over her Republican challenger.\n\nThe poll released on Sunday shows Trump and Ms Harris tied in battleground states, where the former president held a five-point lead while Joe Biden remained in the race.\n\nFollowing the announcement expected on Tuesday morning, a campaign video will be released before Ms Harris and her new running mate jointly hold a rally in Philadelphia that evening.\n\nShe reportedly met her vetting team - led by former US attorney general Eric Holder - over the weekend and received in-depth presentations on their findings, including potential political vulnerabilities.\n\nShe met three of those candidates - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - on Sunday.\n\nShe also met another top contender - Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - on Friday and is understood to have spoken with other candidates virtually, US media report.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, in response to a report that Ms Harris had made her pick, a campaign spokesperson, Kevin Munoz, wrote on social media that she was still deciding.\n\n\"We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!\" he said.\n\nIt comes as the DNC finished a virtual roll call vote that saw Ms Harris officially become the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign.\n\nThe Harris campaign has met with a flurry of lobbying efforts on behalf of - or criticising - the candidates.\n\nMr Shapiro, for example, has drawn sharp opposition from some left-wing groups for his support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as well as his pro-Israel views.\n\nThe Philadelphia event will be followed by a string of campaign events across Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, before ending with a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10 August.\n\nTrump and his running mate, JD Vance, have both suggested that Ms Harris' choice of running mate will ultimately have no impact on the upcoming election.\n\nIn an episode of the \"Full Send\" podcast aired on Friday, Mr Vance said he believed the vice-presidential choice \"doesn't really matter, as much as this hits my ego\".\n\n\"People are going to vote primarily for Donald Trump or for Kamala Harris,\" he said. \"That's the way these things go.\"\n\nSimilarly, Trump has largely shrugged off questions about Ms Harris's choice, arguing last week that the vice-presidential role \"does not have any impact\".\n\nOn Sunday, however, Trump criticised Mr Shapiro on Fox News, saying that Ms Harris could lose \"her little Palestinian base\" if she chooses him.\n\nMr Shapiro, who during his student days wrote in a college magazine that Palestinians were \"too battle minded\", told reporters on Friday that he now supported a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "hiiraan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hiiraan Online"},

Tim Walz of Minnesota is her choice.\n\nThe selection caps the Midwestern Democrat's short but swift ascent from a relative unknown to a leading driver of the party's attacks on Donald Trump and the MAGA agenda.\n\nHarris had not formally called Walz to offer him the position, a source familiar with process told CNN.\n\nA former educator, Walz is currently in his second term as Minnesota governor and chairs the Democratic Governors Association. He previously served 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district that, both before and after his tenure, has been mostly dominated by Republicans.\n\nIn the time leading up to his selection as Harris' running mate, Walz had first been an outspoken defender of Joe Biden following his disastrous debate performance as calls for the president to end his reelection bid escalated. When Biden did drop out, Walz endorsed Harris the next day and has since emerged as a reliable, energetic and cutting advocate for the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nPicking Walz also underscores the Harris campaign's focus on a path to victory that puts a premium on the \"blue wall\" states of the Midwest. Minnesota is slightly outside that sphere, but Walz, once a high school football coach, has evolved during his time in office into something of a progressive populist folk hero - the exact kind of pugilistic voice that Democrats taking on Trump are keen to highlight.\n\nHe has over the past week delivered a handful of memorable haymakers against Republicans, though his most notable contribution has been a determination to label the GOP, especially its presidential ticket of Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Walz has referred to the duo as \"weird dudes,\" before lighting into their political agenda.\n\nThe phrase has stuck, becoming a central meme in the new, post-Biden version of the campaign, a development that is delighting Democrats and apparently frustrating many on the right.\n\nDuring recent remarks at a \"White Dudes for Harris\" fundraiser, Walz made a rough-and-ready case for the vice president before would-be small-dollar donors.\n\n\"How often in 100 days do you get to change the trajectory of the world? How often in 100 days do you get to do something that's going to impact generations to come?\" Walz asked. \"And how often in the world do you make that bastard wake up afterwards and know that a Black woman kicked his a**, sent him on the road?\"\n\nThe line was well received on the call and almost immediately grabbed headlines. For many Democrats, at least, the online virality - with apologies to Biden's \"Dark Brandon\" meme - was the kind they have pined for over the past few years.\n\nWalz also has a personal story befitting the zeitgeist - a family history, as he discussed last month, of infertility troubles, with his wife of three decades, Gwen, which allows him to speak with some authority against opponents or skeptics of in vitro fertilization, or IVF.\n\n\"My oldest daughter's name is Hope. That's because my wife and I spent seven years trying to get pregnant, needed fertility treatments, things like IVF - things (MAGA Republicans) would ban,\" Walz told Harris supporters. \"These guys are the anti-freedoms.\"\n\nAnd to draw a bright, cheeky line under his own childhood experience, Walz - not for the last time - recounted that he \"grew up in a small town: 400 people, 24 kids in the class, 12 cousins.\"\n\nPrior to Congress, Walz was a high school teacher and football coach and served in the Army National Guard. Over more than a decade in Congress, he assembled a fairly centrist voting record. As a first-time campaigner, he opposed a ban on same-sex marriage and supported abortion rights. And once in Congress, he balanced that out with comparatively more conservative positions on gun rights, which resulted in scoring a National Rifle Association endorsement. Walz has since fallen out of favor with the gun lobby over his support for gun safety actions as governor.\n\n\"I think he was a solid Democratic member of the House with a few twists - focus on ag, farmers, rural areas,\" said Democratic strategist Jeff Blodgett, a longtime aide to the late Sen. Paul Wellstone. \"I think that he wanted to protect rifles and things of that nature as a rural congressman.\"\n\nWalz ran for governor in 2018, emerging victorious by a double-digit margin. He won reelection in 2022 with 52 percent of the vote. As governor Walz had to grapple with divided government and slim majorities in the state Legislature. But in 2022, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (as the state's Democratic Party is known) won control of both the state House and Senate giving Walz's party a slim \"trifecta\" of legislative control.\n\nThat allowed Walz to sign into law a raft of expansive social welfare programs such as free lunch for public school students, expansive access to Medicaid, increased protections that allow workers to unionize and expanded medical and family paid family leave.\n\nThrough the trifecta, Minnesota Democrats were also able to codify abortion rights into law, increase transgender rights protections, pass a marijuana legalization bill and install new gun safety laws. Progressives hailed the work as an example of all that Democrats could achieve. Former President Barack Obama wrote in a tweet praising the most recent legislative session that it was a \"reminder that elections have consequences.\"\n\nWalz touted the trifecta's work in a combative 2023 State of the State address.\n\n\"There's nowhere quite like Minnesota right now,\" he told the audience of lawmakers. \"Together, we're not just showing the people of Minnesota what we're capable of in delivering on our promises. We're showing the entire American people just how much promise is contained in that progressive vision held by so many people.\"\n\n\"As governor, he's embraced the idea that it's really important to invest in people and infrastructure to grow the economy,\" Blodgett said. \"And to do it in a way that really helps people in the middle and down below. To me, it's just a huge focus on economic issues that are kitchen table issues that people care about.\"\n\nWhen speculation began about who Harris would pick as a running mate, Walz started out as the darkest of dark horses. He did get support from a few members of Congress such as Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig and Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, as well as encouragement from labor unions. In the end, Walz's background as a governor experienced in working with Democrats and Republicans and his roots in rural Minnesota made him an appealing choice for Harris.\n\nWalz was also a surprise to Republicans.\n\n\"Tim Walz doesn't even register on the fear-o-meter,\" Minnesota Republican strategist Kevin Poindexter said before the announcement, adding that Republicans had been more worried about Harris picking either Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly or Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. \"Him joining the ticket as VP does not bring anything.\"\n\nWalz's selection means that both the Trump and Harris campaigns have vice presidential nominees who their backers hope will help rally support across the Midwest. Democrats hope Walz's Minnesota roots will attract a wide swath of voters throughout the region, while Republicans feel that Ohio Sen. JD Vance's history of growing up in Ohio, as documented in his memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" will find appeal in blue states like Michigan or even Minnesota.\n\nDemocratic strategist Raghu Devaguptapu, a former Democratic Governors Association political director, characterized Walz as a \"real steady hand\" more than anything else as a governor.\n\n\"He's not the most charismatic guy, but he's a steady hand. He's really thoughtful, very likeable. He's done a really nice job of building a broad coalition of support. ... That's the center of strength around Tim Walz,\" Devaguptapu said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A majority of Democratic delegates voted to select Harris as the party's nominee for president in an early virtual roll call vote that happened Monday night.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is expected to officially announce her running mate sometime Tuesday morning, followed by a campaign video that will be released before their Philadelphia rally the same day, according to multiple people familiar with the selection process.\n\nPolitico first reported the campaign's plans.\n\nCBS News has learned Harris is selecting her running mate based on qualities President Biden believed were important when he chose her four years ago, which he has called \"the best decision he has ever made.\" She's looking for a governing partner who has the experience to step into the job and be effective immediately, and who is qualified to be president.

Tim Walz as running mate", "body": "WASHINGTON (TND) -- Vice President Kamala Harris has chosenMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate to take on former President Donald Trump in the November election, according to a CNN report.\n\nHarris is heading off on a blitz of events in swing states trying to capitalize on the early momentum of her campaign.\n\nWalz, a two-term governor with a military and public school teaching background, has been chosen to be Harris' No. 2. Walz has exploded onto the national political scene in the weeks since Harris became the likely nominee advocating on her behalf in interviews and has also received praise for turning a one-seat majority in the state's senate into a springboard for progressive policies.)\n\nHis addition to the ticket may help Harris shore up the Midwestern \"Blue Wall\" states that are vital to Democratic candidates' path to an Electoral College victory.\n\nHarris and her new running mate will start a seven-state battleground tour that begins in Philadelphia on Tuesday and winds through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada this week. Another stop in Georgia was canceled due to the effects of Hurricane Debby. Her early events have drawn large crowds and helped spur a record sum of campaign donations as she builds up her war chest to take on Trump.\n\nThe announcement of her VP pick comes after she became the official Democratic presidential nominee on Monday as a virtual roll call of the party's delegates wrapped up. The virtual call was planned ahead of Biden's sudden exit from the race to ensure the president would appear on the ballot in every state. She was forced into making a quick decision on a running mate with just a few months left until Election Day and spent the weekend prior meeting with six finalists -- Walz, Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThe nomination process became a little more complicated when Biden decided he would end his reelection bid amid mounting pressure from his party to step down after a disastrous debate performance in June enflamed concerns about his age and mental abilities and torpedoed his position against Trump and his candidacy.\n\nHarris received Biden's endorsement shortly after he announced his decision to drop out, and quickly had the party coalesce around her in the hours afterward. She had received pledges from enough delegates to secure the nomination during the second day of her candidacy as more party leaders rolled out endorsements and no challengers emerged.\n\nHer introduction to the race against Trump has flipped the race for the White House on its head again after a whirlwind month of shocking events that recalibrated the election several times over. Biden's poor debate performance inspired panic from Democratic voters and leaders and brought on an instant bump for Trump in polling in a race that had been mostly static for months.\n\nA few weeks later, the race got another shock when a 20-year-old opened fire at Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13. The attempt on his life was the most serious assassination effort since former President Ronald Reagan was shot in. Trump formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination at the party's convention the following week in a four-day event that displayed party unity and enthusiasm for Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance.\n\nThen Biden made his surprise decision to drop out of the race entirely on a Sunday afternoon in an announcement that launched Harris into leading a presidential ticket with 100-plus days left in the race. She saw an immediate bump in public opinion surveys nationally and in swing states, where she has recently overtaken Trump in some places and closed ground on his lead in others.", "source": {"uri": "fox11online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLUK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_denean@fox11online.com", "name": "Austin Denean", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType":

Tim Walz selected as VP Kamala Harris' running mate", "body": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has been selected by Vice President Kamala Harris to be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election, sources confirm to NBC News.\n\nWalz, who retired from the House of Representatives after being elected Minnesota's governor in 2019, has leapt onto the political scene in recent months with his fierce criticisms of former President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nHis most famed contribution to the current political climate was the introduction of the adjective \"weird,\" which he used during an MSNBC interview to describe Republican politicians who he said misrepresented small-town values.\n\n\"We do not like what has happened where we can't even go to Thanksgiving dinner with our uncle because you end in some weird fight that is unnecessary,\" he said. \"It's true. These guys are just weird.\"\n\nThe \"weird\" adjective has become a source of heated debate, with Republicans and Democrats slinging the term at one another as it became a viral hit on multiple social media platforms.\n\nWalz's folksy approach to politics has also endeared him to voters, and he'll aim to appeal to voters in the industrial Midwest, especially in battleground states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, as well as key locations like Nevada and Pennsylvania.\n\nA retired teacher, Walz served in the Air National Guard for more than two decades, retiring in 2005.\n\nHe ran for Congress for the first time in 2006 and won a seat in the House, serving on the Agriculture and Veterans Affairs committees, the latter of which he served on as a ranking member.\n\nHe was elected governor of Minnesota in 2019, and oversaw the state's response to a wide variety of challenges, including the shooting death of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nWalz was one of six finalists identified by NBC News who were tabbed to go through the vetting process as Harris' running mate. That group included Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nIt is expected that Harris' running mate will appear with her at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Tuesday. From there, the vice president and her running mate will travel to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada for a series of rallies to drum up support ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nWhile the DNC typically is the stage for candidates to officially be nominated for the ticket, this year's festivities will be different after Democratic Party officials expressed concerns about an Ohio law requiring candidates to submit their names for the ballot by Aug. 7.\n\nThe Ohio legislature passed a bill altering that timeline, but Democrats opted not to risk legal action and conducted a virtual roll call to nominate Harris over the weekend. It is expected that when Harris names her running mate that the candidate will be accepted by the DNC chair to expedite the nomination process.\n\nBoth candidates will participate in a ceremonial vote when the DNC kicks off in Chicago on Aug. 19. Harris' running mate is expected to address the convention on Aug. 21, with the vice president taking the stage on Aug. 22.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zeke_miller@pantagraph.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@pantagraph.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.", "source": {"uri": "tv360nigeria.com",

Tim Walz to serve as her running mate in the 2024 presidential race, CNN and the Associated Press reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources -- as Harris tries to gain ground on former President Donald Trump with just over three months until the November election.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nWalz has faced backlash from Minnesota Republicans largely over his actions to protect gender-affirming care -- a topic that has become central on GOP tickets. John Helmberger, the CEO of Christian conservative group Minnesota Family Council, argued Walz's executive order to protect gender-affirming care \"victimizes vulnerable young people.\" In the weeks leading up to the nomination announcement, Walz also sparked Republican outrage after he referred to \"weird people on the other side,\" and criticized Trump's laugh and apparent obsession of Hannibal Lecter as \"weird.\" In response, former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy called the \"weird\" argument \"dumb & juvenile,\" while Donald Trump. Jr. responded to claims that Trump running mate JD Vance is \"weird\" with a video posted of Harris with a drag queen.\n\nFormer Obama strategist David Axelrod argued Walz is \"running the most aggressive campaign\" for vice president, in a post on X. Sources close to Harris have also lauded Walz in the run-up to the decision: One person close to Harris' campaign told Politico Walz is \"doing an exceptional job,\" saying he has \"the Midwest grit\" and an appeal that \"goes beyond the Midwest,\" and adding he's more aggressive than vice presidential hopeful Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. Other supporters include Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., a group of 50 progressive lawmakers and the Gen Z focused left-wing Won't PAC Down political action group, whose director Travis Helwig told Politico Walz \"helps quell some of the fears of the 'San Francisco liberal' that Republicans have.\"\n\nPresidential candidates have a long history of strategically choosing running mates in swing states or candidates who appeal to certain voters in hopes of gaining ground in the presidential election. This November, Minnesota will be a critical swing state for Harris, one of seven key states Biden won in 2020 that polls have shown to be close matches in 2024, along with Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A Fox News poll conducted late last month found Harris leading Trump in Minnesota by six points (52%-46%) in a head-to-head match -- Harris leads Trump 47%-41% in the poll when including third-party candidates such as independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (7%). That lead marks a turnaround for the Democratic ticket in Minnesota: An Emerson College poll released one week before Biden's disastrous debate performance found the incumbent tied 45%-45% with Trump (10% undecided). Harris trails behind Trump in the four other swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin), according to recent polls, and the two are tied in Michigan and Pennsylvania, according to Fox News' poll.\n\nSince launching her campaign, Harris has landed major endorsements from Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. One of her biggest endorsements came last week from former President Barack Obama. Sources close to Obama had said the former president wanted to wait until after Biden's Oval Office address last week to make the announcement, and wanted his public endorsement to stand on its own, NBC News reported. Another source told The New York Times Obama wanted to wait until Harris was officially named the party nominee, a process that could unfold as early as Aug. 1, following a rules change approved by the Democratic National Convention's rules panel last week (party nominees are typically chosen by delegates at the Democratic National Convention after the conclusion of the primary cycle).\n\nEven before his disastrous performance in a June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump, Biden -- the oldest president in U.S. history -- had faced questions over his age, perhaps most prominently after the release of a Department of Justice special counsel report in February that found multiple cases of Biden's memory failing. Those concerns ramped up substantially after CNN's presidential debate, a 90-minute affair that resparked mounting concerns over Biden's advanced age and potential cognitive decline. Facing calls from donors, lawmakers and pundits to step down, Biden ultimately announced on Sunday he would end his reelection bid, and quickly endorsed Harris for president. Harris became the presumptive nominee the next day after swiftly amassing the support of enough delegates to clinch the nomination.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ramaswamy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vivek Ramaswamy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angie_Craig", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angie Craig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Axelrod_(political_consultant)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Axelrod (political consultant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Since then, she has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and recast the race against Republican Donald Trump with a boost of energy from her party's base.\n\nAlthough she had gathered enough delegates to be her party's nominee, the Democratic National Committee said late on Monday that she had officially secured the nomination.\n\nHarris is expected to appear with her running mate at an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening. Her selection will demonstrate her thinking about her best pathway to winning the presidency and show who she believes would serve as an effective governing partner should she prevail against Trump.\n\nShapiro, 51, is a rising star in the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes make it a must-win state for both Harris and Trump.\n\nWalz, 60, serves as governor in a solidly Democratic state but has proven appeal to rural, white voters, who in recent years have voted broadly for Trump.\n\nAmericans typically focus on the person at the top of the ticket when choosing whom to vote for, but vice presidential candidates can help or hurt their running mates based on their backgrounds, home state popularity and ability to sway important constituencies or independent voters.\n\nTrump's vice presidential pick, U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has had a rocky start since joining the Republican ticket, with old comments criticizing \"childless cat ladies\" drawing unwelcome attention and potentially alienating women voters.\n\nVance will follow Harris and her new running mate to several swing states this week, the Trump campaign said, including stops in South Philadelphia on Tuesday and Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday. He plans to criticize Harris on economic issues and immigration.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Nandita Bose; additional reporting by Nathan Layne and Chandni Shah; Editing by Colleen Jenkins,

Harris interviewed several top contenders, including state governors Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, during a weekend visit to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe announcement comes as Harris prepares to embark on a tour of pivotal swing states, starting with a rally in Philadelphia later on Tuesday. Harris and her running mate will immediately dive into a series of campaign stops across battleground regions in the days that follow, aiming to make their case directly to American voters.\n\nNotably, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, J.D. Vance, is planning to trail the Democratic ticket to a number of these key states, seeking to counter Harris and her running mate's messaging. Vance is scheduled to speak in Philadelphia on Tuesday, prior to the Democratic event, and will follow Harris to Detroit and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Harris and Vance had also been eyeing a trip to Raleigh, North Carolina, later this week. However, plans for this stop have been disrupted by flooding caused by Tropical Storm Debby, which is expected to make landfall in the region.\n\nThe high-stakes campaign blitz underscores the pivotal role that battleground states will play in determining the outcome of the 2024 election. With the race expected to be fiercely contested, Harris and her running mate will be tasked with energizing Democratic voters and persuading independents and moderate Republicans in these crucial swing regions.", "source": {"uri": "dimsumdaily.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dimsum Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dimsumdaily_hong_kong@dimsumdaily.hk", "name": "Dimsumdaily Hong Kong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nMr Shapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania - the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections - and is seen as giving Ms Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nHis support for Israel and handling of pro-Palestinian protests has sparked a leftist backlash, however, and Democrats are keen to ensure that their mid-August convention in Chicago isn't marred by progressive and anti-Israel activists.\n\nMr Shapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the center than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nMr Walz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance as \"weird\" gaining enormous traction.\n\nOther less likely contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a longstanding friend of Ms Harris; and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.\n\nMs Harris threw her hat in the ring and began her search for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden exited the race on 21 July.\n\nRead more:\n\nLatest US stories\n\nHe had been facing mounting concerns over his low popularity ratings and advanced years, and Mr Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presiding over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Ms Harris's rise continuing unabated ever since, with a Morning Consult survey notably placing her four points ahead of Mr Trump nationally, 48% to 44%.\n\nBut a new CBS News poll found Ms Harris's popularity among black voters some way behind Mr Biden's score as he defeated Mr Trump in 2020, prompting some senior Democrats to caution against complacency.\n\n\"She has a lot of momentum, but if you do look at the polling, this is still a really tight race,\" Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod told political outlet The Hill. \"This is going to be a hard fight for either side.\"", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Walz brings rural, military background to Harris ticket - Roll Call", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket for 2024 on Tuesday.\n\nThe selection was reported by CNN and The Associated Press, citing sources.\n\nWalz, who was first elected governor in 2018 and won reelection in 2022, previously served 12 years in the House, rising to be the top Democrat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n\nShortly after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection, Walz told Minnesota Public Radio that he was prepared to take on the role of running mate if Harris asked, and said that his inclusion on the prospect list was a \"testament to Minnesota. We are the land of vice presidents.\"\n\nBoth Democrats Hubert H. Humphrey and Walter Mondale hailed from Minnesota, winning election as vice president but not faring as well on their own. Humphrey lost the nomination when he ran for president in 1968 after President Lyndon B. Johnson opted against seeking a second full term (the last time that happened before Biden). Mondale won the nomination but was trounced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984.\n\nWalz grew up in Nebraska and joined the National Guard as a teenager to help pay for his college education. He eventually became a teacher in China, and then in Nebraska, before moving in 1996 to Mankato, Minn., where he taught at Mankato West High School. The governor often talks about the challenges of supervising students in a high school cafeteria.\n\n\"You do not leave that job with a full head of hair. Trust me,\" Walz, 60, posted on X in response to a comment about his age.\n\nWalz was a first-time candidate when he ran for Congress in 2006 as the nominee of the state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, ousting six-term Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht in a significantly rural congressional district. Mankato and Rochester, home to the Mayo Clinic, were the population centers of the district Walz represented before winning the governor's race in 2018.\n\nIn addition to classroom teaching, he was a football coach and has previously described himself as \"a big pheasant hunter.\" His ability to engage with more rural voters and Midwestern farmers may be part of why Harris selected Walz over other contenders for the vice presidential nomination. His military experience also provides a counterpoint to that of Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance of Ohio, a Marine Corps veteran.\n\nWalz's boosters included Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers union, who said that either Walz or Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear would be the union's top picks. Fain told CBS News over the weekend that Beshear was his favorite of the half-dozen names floated as finalists.\n\n\"We really like Tim Walz from Minnesota also, think he's an awesome guy for labor. One hundred percent, behind labor. And those would be our top two if we had to pick any,\" Fain said.\n\nWhile in Congress, Walz was one of just 31 Democrats to vote in 2014 and one of just 29 to vote in 2015 to support construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project backed by unions and opposed by environmental groups that President Joe Biden halted after he took office in 2021.\n\nOn votes like those where majorities of the two parties were on opposite sides, Walz voted with fellow Democrats 90.9 percent of the time during his six terms in Congress, according to CQ Vote Studies.\n\nOne vote where he bucked the party, however, could have made vetting for the 2024 ticket dicey. In June 2012, Walz was one of just 17 Democrats to vote to hold then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena from Congress related to the \"Fast and Furious\" program targeting gun trafficking. Holder was tapped by Harris to review potential running mates' backgrounds.\n\nHarris spent the weekend ahead of the announcement interviewing final candidates before selecting Walz. He will make his debut alongside the current vice president on Tuesday evening in Philadelphia before embarking on a cross-country tour with Harris. That includes a stop in Eau Claire, Wis., about an hour-and-a-half drive east of the Twin Cities.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "herb_jackson@rollcall.com", "name": "Herb Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Humphrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Mondale", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walter Mondale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Veterans'_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Tim Walz as her running mate", "body": "For more on the 2024 election, head to the NPR Network's live updates page.\n\nTim Walz, the second-term Minnesota governor with a folksy demeanor, gained a spot on the Democratic ticket as Kamala Harris' vice presidential choice, two sources close to the campaign tell NPR's Deepa Shivaram.\n\nThe former high school geography teacher and National Guard veteran, who helped green light a slate of progressive policy priorities in Minnesota, could help win over voters in Midwestern swing states.\n\nIn recent interviews, Walz has described former President Donald Trump's policy priorities as \"weird\" and said Democrats would expand reproductive health, voting and workers' rights, if elected.\n\nBut the 60-year-old governor could also face questions about his response to riots in Minneapolis following the 2020 murder of George Floyd and widespread fraud during COVID-19 under a federal program intended to feed kids. Audits have suggested lapses in oversight by the state Department of Education.\n\nWalz is fond of one-liners and dad jokes that he uses to poke at political rivals. He recycles them often. He's also not afraid to look frumpy and often sports a plain T-shirt and a ballcap to more casual occasions instead of a suit. He talks fast -- a symptom of being a former high school football coach -- which often makes him trip over words or leads to some confusing run-on sentences.\n\nThe announcement comes as Democrats have rallied around Harris following President Biden's decision to end his reelection campaign. With Harris as the party's new leader, Democrats have seen renewed enthusiasm at rallies and with donors. The Harris campaign says the vice president and her running mate will begin a tour battleground states, starting today in Philadelphia and ending Saturday in Las Vegas.\n\nHarris, who became the official presidential nominee Monday evening, went with Walz over Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania -- a crucial swing state Democrats will likely need to win the election.\n\nWalz was born and raised in rural Nebraska and enlisted in the Army National Guard at age 17. He frequently points to his upbringing in a small community, noting that several of his cousins were classmates.\n\nHe earned a social science degree from Chadron State College in Nebraska in 1989 funded by the GI Bill, then spent a year teaching in China through a Harvard University exchange program before returning to teach students in his home state. He met his wife, Gwen Whipple, while teaching. The pair moved to Minnesota in 1996 and taught at a high school in Mankato, Minn. Walz also spent time coaching football and was an assistant on a state title winning team.\n\nAs Walz was tiptoeing into politics, he took a group of students to a campaign rally for then-President George W. Bush. Walz said they were asked to leave because some were wearing stickers supporting Bush's opponent, John Kerry.\n\n\"This individual says, 'You're not going to be allowed to enter, you've been deemed a threat,'\" Walz told Minnesota Public Radio years after the exchange with a security guard. \"It was a combination of being a little bit frustrated and a kind of epiphany moment of how it felt for people to be looked right through.\"\n\nNot long after that, he was making a move to run for Congress in a year when Democrats were recruiting candidates with military credentials.\n\nAfter a race that focused on the Iraq war and state of the economy, Walz upset longtime Republican U.S. Rep. Gil Gutknecht in 2006. He represented southern Minnesota in Congress for more than a decade before announcing his bid for governor in 2017.\n\nWalz won the race for governor over Republican Jeff Johnson.\n\nMinnesota Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, who Walz defeated in the primary for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination, worked with him to usher in progressive policy wins at the Capitol.\n\n\"I have gotten to know Governor Walz from a very unique perspective. I have deep respect for his candidacy when he and I ran together for the same office,\" Murphy said. \"He's skilled. And he's been a great governor.\"\n\nIn his first term, Walz faced a divided government -- a Democrat-led House and GOP-led Senate. He worked with lawmakers in 2019 to pass a budget with wins for both sides -- boosted spending for schools and a tax cut.\n\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a Republican, said he had a good working relationship with Walz.\n\n\"We found compromises that worked well for the state of Minnesota,\" Gazelka said. \"He did eventually agree to the tax cuts that I was pushing and, and I agreed to fund education at levels higher than I thought we should.\"\n\nBut that relationship was tested as COVID-19 spread around the world and took hold in Minnesota.\n\nAiming to curb the spread of the virus, Walz ordered schools be emptied. Later, he ordered restaurants and houses of worship shut their doors and Minnesotans stay home and required that face masks be worn in public places.\n\nThe restrictions that were initially intended to be brief stretched on and some grew frustrated about the limitations on their lives and Walz's authority.\n\nIn May of 2020, Minnesota faced another moment of crisis. In an incident screened around the world, Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd's neck as he asked for help. Floyd died, and frustration ignited protests and riots around the city.\n\nWalz called in thousands of National Guard soldiers and state troopers to police the Twin Cities, but not quickly enough to prevent the burning of a police precinct and looting of several businesses.\n\n\"We cannot have the looting and the recklessness that went on, we cannot have it because we can't function as a society and I refuse to have it take away the attention of the state that we need to be working on,\" Walz told reporters days into the riots.\n\nWalz and Minneapolis Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey publicly disagreed over who should have taken charge. Gazelka, the former Senate majority leader, said the governor acted too late.\n\n\"I felt like he froze,\" Gazelka said. \"And that delayed getting the National Guard out three days beyond what Mayor Frey had requested. And that's just unacceptable to not be able to handle the crisis in a way that I think it should have been handled.\"\n\nThe timing of the National Guard call-up is part of the presidential race already, with Trump taking credit for the soldiers being sent in after his administration's conversations with the Walz administration.\n\nIn 2022, Walz won reelection after campaigning on a promise to protect access to abortion services in Minnesota after the rollback of Roe v. Wade. And by the narrowest of margins, voters handed Democrats control of the state legislature.\n\nIn their first year with a government trifecta, Democrats checked off every item on their wish list: free breakfast and lunch for students, legal protections for abortion and those seeking gender-affirming care, new clean energy mandates for utility companies, restrictions on guns, legalized marijuana, restoration of voter rights to the formerly incarcerated and paid family and medical leave benefits for workers.\n\nEducation Minnesota President Denise Specht, who leads the state's largest teachers' union, said Walz hasn't forgotten his teaching roots while in office.\n\n\"He's been a great governor to work with, you know, his record for investing in public education. Everything that he's done to improve working lives for working families, protecting collective bargaining,\" Specht said. \"He has a great track record that I think would resonate across this country.\"\n\nWalz's policy wins helped launch the governor's national profile. He became chair of the Democratic Governors Association and co-chair of the Democratic National Convention's Rules Committee.\n\nAsked about whether the raft of Minnesota policy changes would make him too progressive a candidate, Walz joked that he was a \"monster\" for supporting efforts to fund school lunches and guarantee legal protections for those seeking abortions.\n\n\"What a monster. Kids are eating, eating and having full bellies so they can go learn and women are making their own health care decisions,\" Walz told CNN's State of the Union in late July. \"So if that's where they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Former President Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance, is also set to campaign in the city after both held a rally in Georgia on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "erienewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Erie News Now - Your News Team"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://WICU.images.worldnow.com/images/21716717_G.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788903", "eventUri": "eng-9788903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The Associated Press reported Tuesday morning that she has made her decision, which will be made public in a matter of hours.\n\nHarris has whittled a list of a half-dozen finalists down to two, according to Reuters: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Wal\n\nWalz has become the favorite of progressives, while others in the party have pushed for Shapiro and the possibility that he can help deliver Harris to the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes in the election.\n\nWalz attended a fundraiser in Minnesota for the Harris campaign on Monday night. Shapiro was seen playing basketball outside his home in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe tour will also include stops in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Detroit, Michigan, Durham, South Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, Phoenix, Arizona, and Las Vegas, Nevada according to Politico.\n\nBetting odds soar for Walz, Shapiro:\n\nIn recent days, betting odds have surged in favor of either Shapiro or Walz becoming the vice-presidential pick. On Monday, reports suggested that Harris narrowed her shortlist to these two candidates.\n\nThe betting odds on Tuesday are presented as follows: At Oddschecker, Shapiro is favored at -154, meaning a wager of $154 is needed to win $100. Walz, on the other hand, is listed at +188, indicating a $100 bet would win $188 if successful. Kelly and Beshear are long shots, with odds of +2900 and +5900, respectively.\n\nThe matchup between Shapiro and Walz grew closer leading into Tuesday morning. Monday's betting odds had shown Shapiro as the clear favorite.\n\nPolling data from various sources supports this trend. At Polymarket, Shapiro and Walz are tied at 43% each, Kelly at 3%, and Beshear at 1%.

Tim Walz fused his everyman personality with an optimistic progressive message to win the most important audition of his political career the past few weeks, winning the quick admiration of Democratic activists -- and Vice President Kamala Harris, who announced Walz as her running mate Tuesday.\n\nHarris' selection of Walz rockets the former geography teacher from Midwest obscurity into the highest stratosphere of American politics, potentially joining Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale as Minnesotan vice presidents.\n\nWalz's selection follows his splashy arrival on the national stage during a series of high-profile TV interviews since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month and threw his weight behind his vice president.\n\nALSO READ: We asked 10 Republican senators: 'Is Kamala Harris Black?' Things got weird fast.\n\nWalz, who tends to talk in a Diet Mountain Dew-fueled, regular guy patois, has impressed Democrats with his ability to communicate the party's message, while using a one-word zinger -- \"weird\" -- to hammer Republicans for book bans and pushing to outlaw abortion nationwide.\n\nThe two-term governor, who also served a dozen years in Congress, has racked up an impressive legislative record, especially in his second term. He signed bills to create a paid family and medical leave program; provide for universal free school meals; legalize recreational marijuana; sharply increase tax credits for low-income families; and boost sales and gas taxes for transportation and housing.\n\n\"Governor Walz has been a strong leader, a great partner with the Legislature, and is an excellent choice for vice president,\" said Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park. \"We worked together over the last two years on the most productive session in Minnesota in decades, passing policies that will help Minnesotans build better lives for themselves and their families.\"\n\nMinnesota Republicans say Walz has changed the North Star State for the worse. Minnesota House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, wrote recently that \"past two years featured some of the most extreme and irresponsible policies we've ever seen in our state,\" citing tax and fee increases, unsustainable new spending, energy mandates that will hike rates and a rise in the cost of Uber and Lyft rides.\n\nWalz brings a resume that suggests both achievement and middle class roots: He was a high school teacher and assistant football coach in the southern Minnesota city of Mankato, population 45,000, before his election to Congress in 2006, becoming the first Democrat to win the 1st Congressional District in more than a decade.\n\nHe retired from the National Guard after 24 years in 2005 with the rank of command sergeant major, which made him the highest ranking enlisted man to ever serve in the U.S. Congress. Walz underwent surgery to restore his hearing, damaged after years of exposure to artillery ranges. He recently said he can hunt pheasants better than the GOP vice presidential nominee, U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance.\n\nExpect Walz to post up in the so-called blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where the Harris campaign hopes his middle class demeanor will appeal to white, non-college voters who comprise a strong plurality of those battleground states.\n\nA top Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor operative said Walz is well positioned to help Harris carry those crucial states.\n\n\"Tim Walz is a great pick because in addition to his blue collar background and his cultural fit with the blue wall states, as governor his accomplishments are mostly about improving the lives of middle class and working families,\" said Jeff Blodgett, who was chief strategist for Sens. Paul Wellstone and Al Franken. \"This ticket can now powerfully argue that they are the team that is squarely on the side of America's working families.\"\n\nWalz is married to Gwen Walz, a career educator, and is father to an adult daughter Hope and teenaged son Gus, both born with help of in vitro-fertilization. IVF, which accounts for about 2.5% of all children born in the United States, has become a potent political issue in the past year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos created during IVF are legally classified as children; fertility clinics paused use of the technique out of fear of civil and criminal liability.\n\n\"It's not by chance that we named our daughter Hope,\" Walz said in response to the IVF controversy.\n\nWalz will use his compelling biography to introduce himself to the American public, but he will also be forced to defend his five-and-a-half-year tenure as governor of the nation's 22nd most populous state.\n\nWalz's first term especially was marked by the management of crises, from the COVID-19 pandemic to the aftermath of the police killings of George Floyd and Daunte Wright.\n\nRepublicans will almost certainly broadcast images of flaming buildings on Lake Street in Minneapolis, including the 3rd precinct headquarters of the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nOn the second night of protests, as a Lake Street Target was being looted, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called Walz's office and requested help from the National Guard, he later told the Star Tribune, which corroborated the account with state and local records.\n\nWalz publicly assumed command Thursday morning, which is when he called up the National Guard. They were on the ground Thursday evening, but still the city burned; MPD evacuated the 3rd precinct headquarters that night, and looters and rioters ransacked it. The fires continued Friday night.\n\nFormer Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka alleged recently that he called the White House, then occupied by former President Donald Trump, and lobbied the administration to push Walz into action.\n\nWalz blamed outsiders for the destruction, a claim that turned out to be mostly false.\n\nLess than a year later, the Twin Cities was on edge at the outset of the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, accused of Floyd's murder. That's when Brooklyn Center officer Kim Potter killed Daunte Wright, an unarmed Black man, when she drew and fired her service weapon instead of her Taser as she said she intended.\n\nALSO READ:Texas sheriffs engage conspiracy theorist who created Trump enemies 'target list'\n\nAs protests and scattered looting broke out, Walz took a much firmer line, imposing a curfew on three urban counties and bolstering the defense of the Brooklyn Center police headquarters with a massive State Patrol presence.\n\nAs during the Floyd protests, journalists and demonstrators were targeted by police, who used tear gas and less-lethal projectiles to subdue crowds. Walz was criticized for the response, including by many progressive Democrats who broke with him.\n\nEven as Walz dealt with the Floyd and Wright police killings and their aftermath, he was also managing the public health crisis of COVID-19. He leaned on Minnesota's robust public health assets, including the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic. The state's COVID-19 death rate and overall mortality rate during the pandemic were among the nation's lowest.\n\nRepublicans attacked his COVID-19 restrictions as tyrannical, including a directive to avoid large family gatherings during the holiday season of 2020. They also criticized -- and in some cases filed lawsuits over -- his restrictions on youth sports, which accompanied long periods of remote schooling.\n\nThe administration's aggressive posture toward the pandemic extended to getting help to people who needed it, including workers suddenly out of work and hungry children. Minnesota was the first state to get unemployment benefits out to gig workers.\n\nCritics say the Walz administration was also blind to a massive fraud happening in plain sight.\n\nWalz's Department of Education administered a federal program intended to feed hungry children during the pandemic but instead became a cash cow for fraudsters. Legislative audits have sharply criticized the administration's failure to stop more than $250 million in fraudulent payments in what has become known as the Feeding Our Future fraud; 70 people have been charged and nearly two dozen convicted.\n\n\"Under Governor Walz's watch, fraud and waste in our state public programs has exploded,\" Demuth charged.\n\nDespite the tumultuous tenure, Walz was easily reelected in 2022 and delivered major coattails: A Democratic trifecta took command of state government in 2023 for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nDemocrats got to work on a wish list which has become the envy of progressives across the country.\n\nWalz pushed for a tax rebate that came in smaller than what he proposed but still amounted to $1,300 for a family of four.\n\nLawmakers passed a package of $2.6 billion for infrastructure, which has allowed Walz to pose for photos at a bevy of construction projects on roads, bridges and other key infrastructure.\n\nThe deal included $300 million for nursing homes, which are newly subject to a labor-friendly sectoral bargaining system.\n\nIn one of the Legislature's first official acts, Minnesota codified abortion rights, becoming a haven in the Upper Midwest even as neighboring states enacted restrictions.\n\nWalz, who was once a fierce gun rights supporter until the 2018 massacre at Parkland High School -- which happened as he campaigned for governor -- signed two gun control bills in 2023. One extended background checks to all private sales, while a so-called red flag law allows a judge to take a person's guns if he's deemed a threat to himself or others.\n\nWalz signed a bill to restore voting rights to people leaving prison. Undocumented people can now get a driver's license thanks to a bill Walz signed.\n\nA new law mandates a carbon-free electric grid by 2040.\n\nIt's not yet clear what impact these policies will have on the future of Minnesota.\n\nOn measures like life expectancy, family income, unemployment, education attainment and violent crime, the Minnesota metrics during Walz's tenurehave mostly risen and fallen alongside national trends, with Minnesota near the top in many of these quality-of-life metrics.\n\nThose measures don't apply to all Minnesotans, however. The gap between white and Black homeownership in Minnesota is 48 percentage points, for instance. Walz and Democratic lawmakers say that's precisely why they passed a robust first-time homebuyer assistance program for people with modest incomes.\n\nWalz has said his goal is to make Minnesota the best place in the nation to raise a family, including factors like cost-of-living, housing affordability, good paying jobs, education and child care.\n\nThe most troubling metric for Walz, who as a teacher was presumed to be well positioned to be an education governor, is the state's lackluster performance on student achievement tests in recent years.\n\nMinnesota ranks in the top five best states for children, according to a scorecard compiled by the Anne E. Casey Foundation. But in the same study, Minnesota's education system dropped to 19th.\n\nMinnesota has long struggled with some of the nation's worst opportunity gaps, especially for Black and Indigenous students, even as the student population has become steadily more diverse over time.\n\nWalz told the Star Tribune in 2019 that his tenure should be judged by how well he closes the gaps: \"It's a reality I clearly understood and I said during the campaign that I'll be judged and should be judged by how well we close [those disparities], as long as we're given the tools, and I take that responsibility,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Click here to subscribe!\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democratic rising star, is considered the favourite to join Harris as her vice-presidential pick, ahead of several other state governors, a US senator and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nUS media reported Monday that Harris had narrowed one of the most consequential choices of her political career to Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and would likely make her decision public in a video announcement.\n\nLess than a day before their swing state journey, Harris was maintaining the suspense about her running mate, telling supporters in a text message Monday evening that \"I have not made my decision yet.\"\n\nHarris, 59, and her newly minted deputy will hold a rally Tuesday at Temple University in Philadelphia before hitting Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday, Arizona on Friday and Nevada on Saturday.\n\nShe was also intending to hold events in battlegrounds North Carolina on Thursday and Georgia on Friday, but local media outlets reported that a tropical storm battering southeastern states had forced their postponement. There was no response from the Harris campaign on a request for details.\n\nShapiro is enormously popular in Pennsylvania -- the largest of the six or seven swing states that have decided recent US elections -- and is seen as giving Harris a boost in what is considered must-win real estate for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe 51-year-old would be the country's first Jewish vice president, adding to the diversity of a ticket already boasting what would be the only woman ever sent to the Oval Office.\n\nShapiro's backers have argued in any case that the criticism is rooted in anti-Semitism, and many analysts believe his moderate profile gains him more votes from the centre than it loses on the progressive fringe.\n\nWalz, a 60-year-old former National Guard officer who exudes folksy charm, would bring a rural Midwestern perspective to the ticket but is seen as being from the liberal wing of the party.\n\nHe has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators in recent weeks, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as \"weird\" gaining enormous traction.\n\nOther less likely contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and war veteran; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a longstanding friend of Harris; and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\nHarris threw her hat in the ring and began her search for a running mate after 81-year-old Biden exited the race on July 21.\n\nHe had been facing mounting concerns over his low popularity ratings and advanced years, and Trump was surging after surviving an assassination attempt and presiding over a united party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMultiple recent polls have shown Harris's rise continuing unabated ever since, with a Morning Consult survey notably placing her four points ahead of Trump nationally, 48 to 44 per cent.\n\nBut a new CBS News poll found Harris's popularity among Black voters some way behind Biden's score as he defeated Trump in 2020, prompting some senior Democrats to caution against complacency.\n\n\"She has a lot of momentum, but if you do look at the polling, this is still a really tight race,\" Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod told political outlet The Hill. \"This is going to be a hard fight for either side.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenewsguru.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheNewsGuru"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emman_ovuakporie@thenewsguru.com", "name": "Emman Ovuakporie", "type":

Tim Walz as Running Mate", "body": "After a rapid-fire process to vet potential vice presidential candidates, Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to join her on the 2024 Democratic ticket.\n\nCNN was the first to report the news Tuesday morning, which came shortly after reports emerged that Harris had made a decision and would be announcing her pick within hours. Walz will join Harris at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night.\n\nVice President Harris was slingshotted to the top of the ticket last month after President Joe Biden announced that he would be suspending his reelection bid. With the Democratic National Convention approaching, the months-long process typically involved in vetting vice presidential candidates was condensed into a matter of weeks.\n\nFrom the start, Harris' vice presidential search appeared to favor white, middle-of-the-road Democratic men, as the party seeks to shore up support among moderate and independent voters.\n\nWalz, the Minnesota governor, has been on a media blitz since Biden dropped from the race, demonstrating to the campaign that he's as comfortable dressing down Republicans on the nightly news as he is speaking to voters in dad-fit and a baseball cap. As governor, Walz has signed legislation codifying reproductive rights, paid family leave, free school meals, and the legalization of marijuana in Minnesota -- and he's done it all with a narrow legislative majority.\n\nWalz may be a little less well-known than some of the other VP hopefuls, but if the last few weeks are anything to go by, he'll have no problem making an impression.\n\nBy picking Walz, Harris hopes to keep up the momentum in a campaign that is off to a lightspeed start. In July alone, the Harris campaign reported raising $310 million -- bringing her total cash on hand to a whopping $377 million.\n\nTrump, by contrast, has been struggling to find his footing in the aftermath of Biden's exit from the race. His own VP pick -- Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) -- has been a disaster for the campaign. According to an ABC News/IPSOS poll released earlier this week, Vance's favorability rating is underwater by a staggering 15 points.\n\nWhile Harris is hosting sold-out rallies featuring Megan Thee Stallion and Quavo, Vance is struggling to explain away a series of comments in which he made clear he holds a deep disdain for childless Americans and women, combating false memes that suggest he enjoys sex with furniture, and failing to shake the label of being \"weird.\"\n\nTrump himself has had a series of public meltdowns in his attempts to cut through Harris' early dominance. Last week, the former president participated in a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists' convention in Chicago and launched a racist broadside against Harris, questioning her racial identity.\n\n\"She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black,\" Trump said. \"So I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?\"\n\nHarris responded to the comments later that afternoon at an event in Houston. \"This afternoon, Donald Trump spoke at the annual meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists. And it was the same old show: the divisiveness, and the disrespect. And let me just say the American people deserve better.\"\n\nSo far, it seems the American people are listening.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalization_of_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parental leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Tim Walz as her running mate", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, sources familiar with the decision confirmed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe two are set to make their first joint appearance at a rally in Philadelphia later Tuesday.\n\nThe decision caps a hectic period in American politics that began with President Joe Biden's decision to step aside from the Democratic ticket last month and endorse Harris to take his place - and the groundswell of support in the days that followed.\n\nWalz, who was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018, has been touted by Democrats as an effective communicator for the party. He has been widely credited with starting the messaging strategy that has taken off within the Harris campaign of branding the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance as \"weird.\"\n\nTrump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Spectrum News, but his Super PAC, Maga Inc., sent a press release with a headline reading: \"Tim Walz is an incompetent liberal.\"\n\nWalz, a former public school teacher and military veteran, also serves as a co-chair of the DNC Rules Committee and the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. He previously served in the House of Representatives representing a district that had leaned Republican.\n\nBut Walz does not hail from what is considered to be a major battleground state and has a record that some consider more progressive and therefore potentially less enticing to swing voters.\n\nSince the vice president announced she would seek the nomination, Harris has been swamped with support from the party's biggest names - from former presidents like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton to party leaders like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries - as well as record-setting fundraising, notching $310 million in July.\n\nShe's also virtually erased Trump's leads in polling in both nationwide and state-level polls in must-win battlegrounds, closing the gap with the Republican former president and, in some surveys, overtaking him.\n\nHarris' announcement comes the day after the Democratic National Committee's roll call vote closed, allowing her to formally clinch the party's presidential nomination. She's the first woman of color to lead a major political party's ticket. If elected, she would become the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to become president.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Tim Walz as her running mate, CNN and the Associated Press reported. Harris is expected to make the announcement official later on Tuesday.\n\nA six-term congressman from a largely rural southern district who was elected to the governor's office in 2018, Walz was not much of a household name for most Democrats outside the Midwest until a few weeks ago, when, in an interview with Morning Joe about Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, he struck a bit of messaging gold.\n\n\"We do not like what has happened where we can't even go to Thanksgiving dinner with our uncle because you end up in some weird fight that is unnecessary,\" Walz said.\n\n\"It's true,\" he continued. \"These guys are just weird!\"\n\nWhile Harris vetted and interviewed a slate of white male elected officials (and one white male Cabinet secretary), Walz emerged as a favorite of online and tuned-in progressives, and \"weird\" became a rallying cry of all sorts for pundits and politicos looking to put their finger on the, well, strange obsessions of the Late Trump GOP. Even the reported runner-up for the VP nod, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, tried the term out.\n\nBut Walz was not just a 60-year-old guy with a catchphrase. He was respected enough as a member of Congress that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly advocated on his behalf last week. And, while not exactly a leftist himself, Walz had support from members of the House Progressive Caucus and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said Walz was one of the union's two favorites for the job.\n\nAs governor, Walz has used narrow legislative majorities to secure free school lunches for students; he got paid family and medical leave for workers. And even though he once boasted an A-rating from the National Rifle Association -- one of the last elected Democrats to receive such an endorsement -- Walz eventually broke with the organization and signed a new background checks law as governor.\n\nVice presidential candidates generally only affect voters' choices at the margins, but Walz's background is at least part of the appeal as Harris attempts to shore up support in the Midwestern states that former President Barack Obama carried twice and Joe Biden once, but which Donald Trump flipped in 2016. A former command sergeant major in the Army National Guard, Walz was raised in Valentine, Nebraska. He graduated from Chadron State College and then taught geography and coached football and girls basketball in the small town of Alliance, Nebraska. Eventually, he coached and taught in Mankato, Minnesota, where he moved with his wife, Gwen. In a 2002 profile for the Chadron Record, after he was one of six teachers in the state to receive an Ethics in Education award, a colleague said that Walz \"has the ability to reach kids -- the rich kids, the poor kids, the white kids, the minority kids, the not-so-great students.\"\n\nWalz told the Omaha World-Herald that he first took a serious interest in politics in 2004, when he took his students to see a campaign rally for President George W. Bush. After the students were denied entry because one of them had a John Kerry sticker on his wallet, Walz told the paper, the Mankato West linebackers coach began volunteering at the local Democratic field office. The next year, with almost nothing in the way of national support until the final weeks of the race, he ran for office against a six-term Republican congressman and won by six points. Over the weekend, Politico's Meredith Lee posted a radio ad from that race that is worth listening to for anyone wanting to understand how Walz has thrived in politics:\n\nLike every other prospective running mate under consideration, Walz will have his current job filled by a Democrat if his ticket wins in the fall. Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, would become the first Native American woman to be a governor in American history.", "source": {"uri": "motherjones.com", "dataType":

Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate on Tuesday, Reuters reported citing CNN, thrusting the outspoken Midwestern statesman into the national spotlight while adding a key ally to her fast-moving campaign for the presidency.\n\nWalz, 60, brings political mastery, suburban-and-rural appeal and progressive patriotism to a competition where all three criteria are seen as helpful for Democrats to clinch a 2024 win against the Republican ticket of former President Donald Trump and and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.\n\nA military veteran, former public school teacher and six-term congressman, Walz is now serving the sixth year of his eight-year stint as governor of the North Star State.\n\nHe has been an ardent supporter of President Joe Biden and was a surrogate for his reelection campaign. After the president's disastrous debate performance in June, Walz often took to the airwaves to defend Biden and boast about the administration's accomplishments, even in the face of Democratic doubts.\n\nAfter Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 amid rising concerns about his age, Walz took to X, formerly Twitter, calling him \"an American hero\" and saying that history \"will look fondly on his legacy.\"\n\nBiden endorsed Harris as his successor shortly after announcing his decision.\n\nIn naming Walz as her running mate, Harris selected a pro-union Democrat who can speak to the concerns of blue-collar workers in Midwestern states - and beyond.\n\nThe big question: As President Joe Biden steps aside, is America ready for President Kamala Harris?\n\nBorn and raised in rural Nebraska by a public school administrator and a community activist, Walz spent summers working on his family farm before enlisting in the Army National Guard at 17.\n\nHe spent the next quarter century serving his country while holding down a series of positions as a school teacher - first at a Native American reservation in South Dakota, then overseas in China, then back home in Nebraska and finally in Minnesota, where he and his family relocated in 1996.\n\nWalz decided to run for office a decade later, in 2006, seeking to represent a staunchly Republican-held district in the southern part of the state.\n\nHis win against the six-term incumbent came as somewhat of a surprise to political observers, but Walz proved a popular candidate who styled himself as a plain-spoken moderate able to connect with the district's mostly rural voters.\n\nWalz's ability to bridge the tricky divide between progressive policies and conservative values resonated with his constituents, who elected him to serve five additional terms in Congress. It's also a talent the Harris campaign will seek to wield as it crisscrosses the nation in an effort to sway voters of all stripes - especially those with conservative leanings in swing states.\n\nDuring his tenure, Walz sat on the House Agriculture Committee, Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Armed Services Committee, and proved a solid supporter of key Democratic issues - voting, for example, to raise the federal minimum wage, protect abortion rights and advance the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHis affable personality and penchant for public service propelled Walz's political rise from Congress to the governor's mansion.\n\nWalz entered the gubernatorial race in 2018 after then-Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton chose not to seek reelection, and he defeated his Republican challenger by a wide margin. He easily won re-election four years later, alongside Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Nation of Ojibwe.\n\nWalz raised $11.6 million in his 2022 reelection campaign and $5.3 million in his first gubernatorial campaign in 2018, campaign finance records show.\n\nWith a slim Democratic majority in Minnesota's House and Senate, Walz during his two terms has been able to usher into law several progressive measures sure to appeal to liberal voters nationwide.\n\nIn the 2023 legislative session alone, he and his Democratic allies accomplished major policy goals, including restoring voting rights to people convicted of felonies post-incarceration, expanding paid family and medical leave for Minnesota workers and providing universal free meals for public school students.\n\nThe school meal bill Walz signed ensures that every student can receive breakfast and lunch for no cost, part of an effort to reduce childhood food insecurity. Its cost - estimated at $400 million over the first few years and increasing over time - sparked opposition from some Republican lawmakers.\n\n\"The haves and the have-nots in the school lunchroom is not a necessary thing,\" Walz said during a press conference at the time defending the measure. \"Just feed our children.\"\n\nHis tenure has not been without controversy, though.\n\nWalz received intense local and national backlash for his failure to control the unrest sparked by the police murder of George Floyd and the destructive riots that ensued.\n\nFloyd's murder by Derek Chauvin catapulted Minneapolis into the national spotlight, acting as a microcosm of racial justice reform in the 21st century and public pressure to address police brutality.\n\nSome protests turned violent as demonstrators vandalized and destroyed public property, including burning down the Minneapolis Police Department's 3rd precinct. Estimates total over half a billion dollars in damages. Walz activated the National Guard.\n\nChauvin was later convicted of Floyd's murder, among other charges related to his death, as were three other officers.\n\nWalz also faced criticism for a massive $250 million post-pandemic-relief fraud scheme by a Minnesota-based nonprofit, Feeding Our Future and Partners in Nutrition, that was meant to feed children in need.\n\nOver 70 defendants have been charged in connection to what prosecutors have called the biggest pandemic-fraud scheme in the nation, with seven people already tried and five found guilty.\n\nWalz accepted responsibility for the lack of fraud protection and proper oversight at the state's Department of Education under his administration after a scathing legislative audit was released.\n\nThese things could come back to haunt Walz on the campaign trail as he and Harris seek to tout their public safety and government spending bona fides.\n\nPerhaps Walz's biggest advantage to the campaign is his track record as a bulwark of women's rights. Through the years, Walz has used his position to protect access to reproductive care in Minnesota and beyond.\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Minnesota became the first state to codify abortion rights via the state legislature.\n\nThe Protection of Reproductive Options Act, which Walz signed in January 2023, enshrines women's rights to reproductive freedom without interference from politicians.\n\nOne year later, during a roundtable event with members of Planned Parenthood, Walz called Minnesota an \"island of decency\" that welcomes women from other states seeking abortions.\n\nSince the bill's passage, Minnesota has seen an influx of out-of-state patients seeking care.\n\nAnd during his 2024 State of the State address, Walz briefly disclosed his own family's painful struggle to conceive and their use of in vitro fertilization, a procedure that has come under attack in the conservative movement to restrict reproductive freedom.\n\n\"Your personal decisions about your family are no one's business but your own,\" he said at the time. \"You have my pledge as long as I am governor, IVF will continue to offer a lifeline of hope for Minnesota families.\"\n\nWalz gained national exposure when he was named co-chair of the president's Council of Governors in 2021. In 2023, he was elected chair of the Democratic Governors Association, where he was a part of critical talks concerning Biden's fitness for office just weeks before the octogenarian ended his campaign.\n\nAnd this spring he was elected as co-chair of the Democratic National Convention rules committee.\n\nWalz joined the Biden-Harris campaign in Milwaukee in mid-July during the Republican National Convention. While there, he criticized his now-vice presidential opponent, Vance, the Ohio senator, on his abortion stance and small-town roots.\n\nVance said in a January 2022 podcast while he was running for the U.S. Senate that he \"certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally,\" a comment he has since tried to walk back by aligning with Trump's recent statement that abortion should be a state issue.\n\nWalz reiterated his criticism of Vance on social media the same week.\n\n\"I grew up in a small town. JD Vance is dead wrong about what makes small-town America tick. Small towns don't work because everyone is closed-minded and prejudiced,\" he wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"They work because people mind their own damn business. JD Vance seems to have a real problem minding his.\"\n\nWalz holds a bachelor's degree in social science education from Chadron State College in Nebraska and a master's of science degree in educational leadership from Minnesota State University Mankato.\n\nIn addition to being a veteran and a school teacher, Walz served as a high school football coach and led his team to win its first state championship.\n\nHe is married to Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz, also a former educator, and has two children, Hope and Gus.\n\nWalz's current term ends in 2026. If Harris and Walz win this November, the governor would have to resign from his current office and Flanagan would serve out the remainder of his term.\n\nIn being picked for the ticket by Harris, Walz beat out several other high-profile politicians considered by the campaign. Among them were Generation X governors Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan; swing state allies like U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania; seasoned pros like Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina; billionaire businessman and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker; as well as rising political star U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nSam Woodward is an election reporting fellow for USA TODAY.

Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\n0 Comments Get Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "missoulian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "missoulian.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zeke_miller@missoulian.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@missoulian.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missoula,_Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missoula, Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missoula, Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Berkoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Katharine Berkoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Horse_Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hungry Horse Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going-to-the-Sun_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Going-to-the-Sun Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Tim Walz as her running mate in bid for must-win states", "body": "The Minnesota governor could help boost the ticket's appeal among white rural voters, especially in swing states.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, a selection that Democrats hope will boost the ticket's chances among white rural voters in must-win swing states, NBC News reported on Tuesday, citing three sources with knowledge of the decision.\n\nHarris' choice of Walz as her running mate could broaden the ticket's appeal: Harris as a Black, Asian woman from California with experience as a prosecutor, and Walz as a white, folksy Midwesterner with a record of enacting progressive policies.\n\nWalz, picked from a formidable pool of candidates, is by no means a national figure in the Democratic Party. But he quickly rose to the top of Harris' VP shortlist in recent weeks as he stumped for the de facto Democratic nominee on cable news, earning wide praise for his sharp criticism of the Donald Trump-JD Vance agenda. His labeling of Republicans as \"weird\" also caught on fast -- and has appeared to strike a nerve among some Republicans.\n\nAlthough Minnesota is not considered a battleground state, Democrats are hoping that Walz's personal story and his progressive credentials can help the ticket win over voters in rural areas who have been more drawn to the GOP in recent elections.\n\nWalz's allies have touted his background and his resume as a boon to the Harris ticket. A Nebraska native, the twice-elected Minnesota governor is a military veteran and a former schoolteacher and high school football coach. He represented a traditionally red-leaning district in Minnesota in the U.S. House for 12 years before being elected governor in 2019.\n\nSince 2022, when Democrats won control of the state Legislature, Walz has passed billions in funding for schools, including free school lunches; shored up abortion rights; secured stricter gun violence prevention laws; expanded up legal protections for transgender youth; and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.\n\nAsked recently whether his progressive record could expose the Democratic ticket to more attacks, Walz suggested he wasn't bothered by labels.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, where you see the policies that Vice President Harris was a part of making, Democratic governors across the country executed those policies, and quality of life is higher, the economies are better, all of those things,\" he said. \"If that's what they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label.\"", "source": {"uri":

She is set to name her running mate soon, with the two scheduled to embark Tuesday on a seven-state trip of some of the biggest battleground state in the election, according to her campaign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, are set to speak to voters through scheduled rallies and events throughout the week, too. Vance will also be visiting the same battleground states as Harris and her newly minted vice presidential pick.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign is touting its robust ground game in Pennsylvania, saying it's taking \"nothing for granted\" in the state, ahead of her running mate reveal, which is expected on Tuesday.\n\nAbout 33,000 people signed up to volunteer for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the last 15 days, according to a campaign memo. The campaign boasts nearly 300 staffers across three dozen offices in the state, the memo said.\n\nThe campaign also said it was \"doing the work to make inroads in historically-safe Republican areas.\"\n\nThe campaign sought to contrast Harris' record with former President Donald Trump's, citing the vice president's time as a prosecutor and saying she \"is committed to keeping our communities safe and locking up dangerous crooks, criminals, and predators.\"\n\n\"With only three months until Election Day, Trump's campaign still lags far behind in the infrastructure needed to win with just three offices in Pennsylvania,\" the Harris campaign memo said. \"He's shown he doesn't want these voters.\"\n\nKamala Harris earns majority of Democratic roll call votes\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has officially gotten the vast majority of delegate votes in the virtual roll call that nominates her as the Democratic presidential nominee, the Democratic National Committee said in a statement released late Monday.\n\nThe roll call, which concluded on Monday evening, still needs to be certified by Convention Secretary Jason Rae, according to the statement, but the announcement makes Harris's historic nomination effectively official.\n\nSens. Sanders, Warren join Progressives for Harris Call: 'We have to beat Trump in November'\n\nOn a three-hour organizing call with over 100,000 attendees, numerous high-profile progressive democrats came out to support Vice President Kamala's Harris' presidential bid.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Reps. Joaquin Castro, Ro Khanna, Ilhan Omar and Jamie Raskin and UAW President Shawn Fain all showed up as well as members of the uncommitted movement who had not yet endorsed Harris but strongly hope she'll win them over in the next few months.\n\n\"The energy and the momentum in this election is on our side. And I am so inspired by the organizing in support of Vice President Harris, starting with the win with black women that mobilized a massive zoom call. And now here tonight, we have progressives coming together,\" Warren said on the call.\n\nSanders, who has not officially said he endorses Harris -- although he has encouraged voters to go out and support the candidate -- told attendees that \"Trump must be defeated\" and Harris \"must be elected.\" He noted that it's \"imperative that Democrats gain control over the House and the Senate.\"\n\n\"And we in the progressive movement must do all that we can to make that happen,\" he added.\n\n\"I don't know if I can add to what has already been said tonight, but my message is pretty clear, and that is all of us together must do everything that we can to defeat Donald Trump and elect Kamala Harris as our next president,\" said Sanders.\n\nHarris campaign selling yard signs without revealing running mate's name\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign is promoting pre-orders for a campaign yard sign with a mockup image featuring her last name and tape and question marks over where her yet-to-be-announced running mate's last name would be.\n\n\"Be one of the first to proudly display your support for Kamala Harris and her running mate,\" the campaign said on its website.\n\nJD Vance to also give remarks in same states as Harris this week\n\nRepublican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is scheduled to give remarks in the same states on the same days as Vice President Kamala Harris this week, the Trump-Vance campaign announced, as Harris embarks on a battleground state tour.\n\nVance is scheduled to speak at noon ET in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The event comes as Harris is set to hold a rally with her yet-to-be-announced running mate Tuesday night in the city.\n\nOn Wednesday, he is scheduled to deliver remarks in the Detroit suburb of Shelby Township, Michigan, and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, as Harris also campaigns in those states then.\n\nThen on Thursday, he is set to speak in Raleigh and Oakboro in North Carolina, aligning with Harris' scheduled visit to the state.\n\nBon Iver will join Harris and her running mate on Wednesday in Eau Claire, Wisconsin -- where the Grammy-winning indie folk band was founded -- for a \"special performance\" as part of the campaign's battleground state tour, the Harris campaign announced on Monday.\n\n-ABC News' Gabriella Abdul-Hakim, Fritz Farrow, Will McDuffie and Isabella Murray\n\nHarris still deliberating on VP pick: Source\n\nAt this moment, Vice President Harris has not decided on a running mate and is still deliberating, according to a source.\n\nMore than 10K people expected at Harris' Philly rally: Source\n\nMore than 10,000 people are expected to attend Harris' rally Tuesday night in Philadelphia, where she'll be joined by her new running mate, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n\nThat would make this the biggest event yet for the Harris campaign.\n\nHarris is looking to build off her momentum. Pennsylvania kicks off her swing through seven battleground states in five days.\n\nThe pace of her campaign is in stark contrast to Trump's, which has only one rally scheduled this week -- in Montana on Friday.\n\nUsha Vance says husband's 'childless cat ladies' comment was a 'quip'\n\nIn her first interview since her husband was named former President Donald Trump's running mate, Usha Vance sat down with Fox & Friends where she discussed her husband's \"childless cat ladies\" comment that has gained attention recently -- calling it a \"quip.\"\n\n\"The reality is, JD made a quote - I mean, he made a quip, and he made a quip in service of making a point that he wanted to make that was substantive,\" Usha Vance said of the comments her husband made in 2021. \"And I just wish sometimes that people would talk about those things and that we would spend a lot less time just sort of going through this three-word phrase or that three-word phrase.\"\n\nShe continued, \"What he was really saying is that it can be really hard to be a parent in this country, and sometimes our policies are designed in a way that make it even harder.\"\n\nShe added that her husband \"would never ever ever want to say something to hurt someone who was trying to have a family who really was struggling with that.\"\n\nJD Vance has called the comments \"sarcastic.\"\n\n\"Let's try to look at the real conversation that he's trying to have and engage with it and understand for those of us who do have families, for the many of us who want to have families, and for whom it's really hard,\" Usha Vance said on Monday. \"What can we do to make it better? What can we do to make it easier to live in 2024?\"\n\n-ABC News' Kelsey Walsh, Hannah Demissie, Lalee Ibssa and Soorin Kim\n\nPelosi says she spoke with Biden ahead of his withdrawal 'asking for a campaign that would win'\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, in an interview with Good Morning America anchor George Stephanopolous on Monday morning, said that she spoke with President Joe Biden ahead of his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race \"asking for a campaign that would win.\" She also said Biden was \"the only person that I spoke to\" about Biden possibly withdrawing.\n\n\"The only person that I spoke to about this was the president. Other people called me about what their views were about it, and -- but I rarely even returned a call, much less initiated one,\" Pelosi said.\n\nLater, she added, \"I wasn't asking him to step down. I was asking for a campaign that would win, and I wasn't seeing that on the horizon.\"\n\n-ABC News' Oren Openheim\n\nHarris VP pick 'most important' decision, Pelosi says\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' choice for her running mate is a the \"most important\" decision she has to make as her campaign gets started, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.\n\nAll of her choices appear to be good, Pelosi added.\n\n\"It's a difficult decision because they are all so great,\" she told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America on Monday. \"It is the most important decision for her to make. Not just about who can help win, but who can help serve and lead and whose confidence she trusts.\"\n\nHarris and to-be-announced running mate to launch seven-state tour Tuesday\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, who is yet to be named, will go on tour, hitting seven battleground states in five days, the Harris campaign said Monday.\n\nThe tour will be an effort to \"introduce the new Democratic ticket\" and \"speak directly with voters in their communities and cement the contrast between our ticket and Trump's,\" campaign said.\n\nThe tour, which kicks off Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, will feature rallies in cities and stops at college campuses, including HBCUs, union halls, family-owned restaurants and their field offices, the campaign said.\n\nThe tour will continue through Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada, the campaign said.\n\nHarris interviewing top VP contenders today at her residence: Source\n\nVice President Harris is meeting with top running mate candidates Sunday at her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nHarris is meeting with at least three leading contenders -- Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, according to the source.\n\nThe meetings were earlier reported by The New York Times.\n\nSen. JD Vance says he wears VP pick criticism as a 'badge of honor'\n\nIn a Fox News interview Sunday, Sen. JD Vance responded to criticism of him being picked as former President Donald Trump's running mate, saying he takes it as a \"badge of honor.\"\n\n\"All I can do is go out there and prosecute the case against Kamala Harris to remind people that things were more prosperous and more peaceful when Donald Trump was president,\" Vance said. \"Look, I recognize there are a lot of folks even in the GOP establishment and certainly on the far left who don't like the fact that Donald Trump picked me, I actually take their criticism as a badge of honor.\"\n\nVance also hit back at Democrats who've called him \"weird,\" calling it \"a lot of projection.\"\n\n\"They can call me whatever they want to. The middle school taunts don't bother me,\" he said. \"What offends me is what Kamala Harris has done to this country over three and a half years.\"\n\nHarris campaign launches 'Republicans for Harris' outreach program\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign announced Sunday that it would be launching a \"Republicans for Harris\" program aimed at reaching Republican voters who could be convinced to vote for Harris. The program will include digital advertising, phone banking, events and other initiatives, according to the campaign.\n\nThe program -- and Harris herself -- have been endorsed by a number of Republican figures, including former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.\n\n\"I might not agree with Vice President Kamala Harris on everything, but I know that she will fight for our freedom, protect our democracy, and represent America with honor and dignity on the world stage,\" Grisham wrote in a statement released by the Harris campaign.\n\nThe \"Republicans for Harris\" program will hold kickoff events starting this week, per the campaign.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She is expected to announce her choice on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe intensive process of vetting a vice presidential candidate typically lasts months.\n\nBut Ms Harris, 59, has had only days to make her selection following Joe Biden's decision to end his re-election bid.\n\nMs Harris is scheduled to make her first public appearance with her running mate at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the first of a five-day, seven-state battleground tour the pair will embark on this week.\n\nThe seven states will likely decide the presidential election, which is just three months away, on November 5.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign was said to have been caught off-guard by Ms Harris's surge in momentum following Mr Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nThe former president's running mate, the Ohio senator JD Vance, has been dispatched to respond to Ms Harris's VP selection, starting with a campaign stop of his own in Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nMs Harris's selection process has exposed some divisions within the Democratic Party.\n\nGiven Ms Harris's lightning-fast ascension to becoming the party's nominee, the hunt for a vice presidential candidate has played out as a proxy primary with acrimonious lobbying campaigns for and against the candidates.\n\nMr Shapiro, the bookies' favourite, has been championed by moderates and is popular in his home state of Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes make it a must-win state for both Ms Harris and Mr Trump.\n\nHowever, he has faced resistance from progressives, who have cited concerns over his staunch support for Israel.\n\nMr Walz, 60, has become the favourite candidate of the party's Left flank. A former teacher and officer in the National Guard, he served as both a football coach and faculty adviser for the Gay-Straight Alliance student organisation during his two-decade teaching career.\n\nHe was elected to the House of Representatives in 2006 in a Republican-leaning district and is currently serving his second term as governor of Minnesota, where he has delivered on a string of progressive priorities such as free school meals and expanding paid leave.\n\nMs Harris's reported short-list of running mates has solely consisted of white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.\n\nIn addition to Mr Shapiro, Mr Walz and Mr Kelly, potential contenders include transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear and Illinois governor JB Pritzker.\n\nThe candidates will be informed of Ms Harris's decision on Monday night or Tuesday morning, according to Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz as her presidential running mate, three sources tell CBS News. While Walz might not be a household name, his political star has been on the rise in recent weeks after making several viral cable news appearances.\n\nWalz was also credited with helping launch the \"weird\" movement among his fellow Democrats, which has gained traction and put former President Donald Trump, his vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance and other Republicans on the defensive.\n\nHe has also been applauded and condemned for several progressive laws passed while in Minnesota's highest office, especially in his second term when the DFL Party took total control of state government following the 2022 elections.\n\nHe also faced severe criticism in his first term for how he handled the duel crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and the violent uprising that followed the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020.\n\nIn an interview with CNN last month, host Jake Tapper pressed Walz about whether he could harm the Democratic ticket, as the Trump campaign works hard to portray Harris as an ultraliberal. Walz said he was \"more than happy\" to take any label they have.\n\n\"What a monster! Kids are eating and having full bellies so they can go learn, and women are making their own health care decisions. And we're a top-five business state and we also rank in the top three of happiness,\" Walz said.\n\nLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, believes Walz is an asset to Harris' campaign because of his \"attack dog\" skills.\n\n\"I think we'd see Tim Walz really going after the Trump-Vance ticket, and it'd probably be a harsher tone than what we've seen here in Minnesota in his everyday conduct. And he'd really be counted on to win the key states in the Upper Midwest,\" Jacobs said.\n\nHere are several of Walz's accomplishments -- with an unusual number of legislative successes scored in March 2023 alone -- and setbacks during his tenure as governor.\n\nWalz's use of emergency powers during the pandemic -- including the institution of a mask mandate, business shutdowns and a hotline number established to report people violating social distancing guidelines -- outraged his critics.\n\nSeveral lawsuits followed, including one filed in 2020 by the conservative Upper Midwest Law Center alleging Walz misinterpreted the Minnesota Emergency Management Act and illegally bypassed state lawmakers when issuing a peacetime emergency.\n\nThe case, which focused on the mask mandate, eventually made its way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which sent it back to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In July 2023, that court ruled that Walz indeed had the authority.\n\nDuring his 2022 reelection campaign against GOP candidate Dr. Scott Jensen, who was banned from some social media platforms for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, Walz consistently defended the \"hard decisions\" he made during the pandemic. He went on to defeat Jensen by nearly 200,000 votes.\n\nConservatives lashed out at Walz in March 2020 for his delay in the historic activation of the Minnesota National Guard, which helped restore order on Twin Cities streets during the unrest.\n\nThe delay drew the ire of then-President Trump, who went on to falsely claim he ultimately made the call. Months after the chaos, Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he asked Walz for troops three days before he gave the green light.\n\nWalz, who served in the Army National Guard for nearly a quarter of a century, clapped back at Frey.\n\n\"I don't think the mayor knew what he was asking for,\" Walz said. \"I think the mayor said, 'I request the National Guard, this is great. We're going to have massively-trained troops.' No, you're going to have 19-year-olds who are cooks!\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News, Minnesota Republican Party Chair David Hann accused Walz of delaying guard activation because \"he was fearful of alienating his progressive base, who were supporting the riots.\"\n\n\"[Walz has] been a disaster for Minnesota and is by far the most partisan governor that I can remember having,\" Hann said. \"He displayed a remarkable lack of leadership in dealing with the riot that was very destructive, and the aftermath of which is still affecting the quality of life and the business climate in Minneapolis.\"\n\nIn a 1995 ruling, the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld abortion rights in Minnesota. In January 2023, Walz signed the PRO Act (Protect Reproductive Options Act) into law, making abortion a \"fundamental right,\" as well as access to contraception, fertility treatments, sterilization and other reproductive health care.\n\nThe law made Minnesota the first state to codify abortion rights in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which nullified Roe. v. Wade after nearly 50 years of precedent.\n\n\"Your access to reproductive health and your right to make your own health care decisions are preserved and protected,\" Walz said during the signing ceremony. \"And because of this law, that won't change with the political wins or makeup of the Supreme Court. This is a bill for Minnesota today and all future generations.\"\n\nRepublicans vigorously opposed the PRO Act, which was labeled as an \"extreme law\" by the party's top lawmakers, who failed to add amendments that would've banned third-trimester abortions and required clinics to be licensed.\n\nIn April 2023, Walz signed the Reproductive Freedom Defense Act into law, shielding women and providers from any legal action originating from the patient's state.\n\nIn March 2023, Walz signed an executive order to protect the right of residents to have access to gender-affirming health care. Weeks later, he signed the \"Trans Refuge\" bill, banning the enforcement of arrest warrants, extradition requests and out-of-state subpoenas for those who traveled to Minnesota for care.\n\n\"When someone else is given basic rights, others don't lose theirs,\" Walz said. \"We aren't cutting a pie here. We're giving basic rights to every single Minnesotan.\"\n\nRepublicans sought to place an amendment in a separate bill to outlaw access in line with some neighboring states.\n\nOther critics, including Christian conservative groups, claimed the law places vulnerable youths in danger of irreparable harm.\n\nProponents say gender-affirming care treatments are evidence-based with plans developed on a person-by-person basis, taking into consideration the patient's developmental stage.\n\nThe practice of putting LGBTQIA+ youths into \"conversion therapy,\" which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, was also formally banned in early 2023, although Walz issued an executive order two years earlier to restrict the practice.\n\nOpponents of conversion therapy, like Children's Minnesota pediatrician Dr. Angela Kade Goepferd, say the practice can cause psychological trauma, and increase the risk of self-harm and suicide.\n\nOpponents of the ban said it was ultimately an attack on religious freedom.\n\nLater that year, Walz signed a public safety package including a \"red flag\" law that allows family members, roommates or law enforcement to petition the courts to remove firearms from the possession of anyone deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\nAnother law within the package required private gun transfers to be subject to background checks.\n\n\"This is not about the second amendment,\" Walz said. \"This is about the safety and security of our communities. That's what's happening here today.\"\n\nRepublicans and gun rights advocates accused Walz and DFL lawmakers of burying the gun control measures into the enormous package, and unfairly impacting the rights of lawful gun owners.\n\nIn May 2023, Walz signed a law creating a state-run program to provide paid family and medical leave for Minnesota workers, funded by a 0.7% payroll tax on employers, by 2026.\n\nWhile proponents say the law is an \"equalizer\" that provides a road map for a similar federal effort, critics claim it would cost much more than estimated and devastate small businesses.\n\nIn May 2023, Minnesota became the 23rd state in the nation to legalize recreational cannabis use. Three months later, people 21 and older could start to possess certain amounts of marijuana at home and on their person, in addition to legally growing up to eight plants at a time.\n\nMinnesotans with minor marijuana convictions are also eligible to have their criminal records expunged, and residents from communities of color -- which were disproportionately targeted for arrests and convictions for possession for decades -- are given preferential status in applying for cannabis-related business licenses.\n\nRepublican lawmakers accused the Democratic majority at the Capitol of forcing through legislation that was full of loopholes that ultimately endanger youths and increase public safety risks, especially the prospect of more impaired drivers on state roads.\n\nWalz also signed a bill into law in March 2023 that allows Minnesota residents of any immigration status the ability to obtain a driver's license.\n\nAdvocates for the bill, which had strong backing from law enforcement, business and religious groups, said it would lead to safer roads and a stronger economy.\n\nOpponents accused lawmakers and Walz of potentially opening up a Pandora's box that could blur eligibility for voting and enrollment in other state programs.\n\nRepublican lawmakers also unsuccessfully sought to make special licenses for undocumented Minnesotans that would be easily distinguishable from the standard cards.\n\nIn that same watershed month, Walz signed a bill that restored the right to vote to more than 50,000 convicted felons who had already served their time.\n\n\"We are in a country of second chances, we're a country of welcoming people back in. And the idea of not allowing those voices to have a say in the very governing of the communities they live in is simply unacceptable,\" Walz said.\n\nSeveral Republicans lambasted the legislation, saying those still serving probation for felonies should not have the right to vote. Sen. Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, went further, saying the law \"opens our elections to being influenced by convicted felons and illegal immigrants.\"\n\nAmid the increase in food insecurity for many Minnesotans during the pandemic, and the subsequent strain on the state's food shelves that remains to this day, Walz signed a bill in March 2023 that ensures all K-12 students in the state have access to free breakfast and lunch on school days.\n\n\"As a former teacher, I know that providing free breakfast and lunch for our students is one of the best investments we can make to lower costs, support Minnesota's working families, and care for our young learners and the future of our state,\" Walz said.\n\nInitially pegged to cost $388 million in the state's two-year budget, the cost ballooned by more than $80 million, stoking sentiment among Republican lawmakers that the program is a waste of taxpayer funds, and largely provides meals for students of families that can easily afford to pay for them.\n\nIn April 2023, Walz became the first Minnesota governor in three decades to reroute a criminal case from a county attorney to the state attorney general's office.\n\nThe case involved the 2022 murder of 23-year-old Zaria McKeever. The father of her young child was sentenced to life in prison earlier this year for orchestrating her death. Two teenage brothers, one of whom fired the fatal shots inside her Brooklyn Park apartment, were also sent to prison.\n\nHennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty originally put together a plea deal for the brothers that would've see them serve time in juvenile detention instead of being sent to adult facilites. The move angered McKeever's family and community members, and their outcry led Walz to intervene and place the case in the hands of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.\n\nEarlier this year, Moriarty faced fierce criticism for charging a White Minnesota state trooper in the death of a Black motorist in 2023. Her office eventually dropped the charges, and Walz told reporters soon after he had planned to intervene again if Moriarty hadn't made \"the right decision.\"\n\nMoriarty called Walz's move in the McKeever case \"deeply troubling\" and alarming to \"prosecutors across the state.\" That sentiment was shared by the National Lawyers Guild, which called Walz's conduct \"not just wrong, but in the context of other decisions, shows that you are making these sensitive decisions based on political expedience.\"\n\nFollowing the end of the state trooper case in June 2024, Moriarty accused Walz of unfair treatment due to her gender and sexuality, as she is the first openly LGBTQIA+ Hennepin County attorney, pointing to the lack of criticism her predecessor Mike Freeman enjoyed.\n\nWhen pressed by the media about Moriarty's claims, Walz simply responded they were \"false.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In battleground states, they were said to be tied at 50 percent each.\n\nWith the nomination under her belt, Harris is now set to announce her choice for VP - a decision which commentators say is believed to be narrowing down to Pennsylvania Governor Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Walz.\n\nKamala Harris officially Democratic presidential nomineeHarris is ahead with 48% while former President Trump is on 44% in a survey of 11,265 voters conducted by Morning Consult.

Tim Walz after narrowing down her choices to him and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nBut the Democratic campaign had to print signs with the VP's name along with multiple of the finalists to be prepared for when she unveils who will run alongside her in November as her decision comes down to the wire.\n\nHarris is preparing to appear alongside her VP pick at a rally in Philadelphia later Tuesday evening, which will kickoff a five-day, seven-state campaign swing through 2024 battleground territory.\n\nBeside Walz and Shapiro, others thought to be on Harris' shortlist are Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nMost establishment Democrats appear to still be rooting for Shapiro and say he provides the party a higher chance of winning the swing state of Pennsylvania.\n\nOne Democratic strategist told Politico:\n\nWe were down for seven months, so where we are today feels like we're winning. But we are just back to even, we're not winning. And a point in Pennsylvania is worth a hundred points, because in a 50-50 race, it's everything.\n\nAfter announcing her running mate, the duo will have less than two weeks to campaign together before the Democratic National Convention this month where Harris and her pick are expected to become the Party's presidential and vice presidential nominees.\n\n11:40Montana's Democratic Senator Jon Tester accused of 'covering up' Biden's decline in brutal ad launched in battleground state\n\nDemocratic Sen.

Will Democrat presumptive candidate Kamala Harris unveil her running mate for the US Presidential Election 2024 today on Tuesday and introduce him to her supporters at the election rally in Philadephia? NBC News has reported that it may be postponed if the vice president does not make her final decision or if there's a media leak that affects the current plan. The announcement at the rally is likely to be accompanied by digital video and social media components, and a fundraising appeal. Like other previous major events, Kamala Harris's campaign may also send many text messages to its supporters.\n\nThe main contenders for the second highest office include Josh Shapiro; Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona; Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky; and Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary.

It is also believed that since Kamala Harris herself is of Black origin, the vice president pick should appeal to white men who don't like Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nQuoting an unnamed source, NBC News has also reported that Kamala Harris may pick a middle-aged or maybe even slightly older white politician with experience and who can bring credentials differently. He should be someone who gives moderate Republican voters a place to go, the voters may think that JD Vance is terrifying and Trump is horrifying.\n\nAlso Read : The Gilded Age Season 3: Check out new teaser, and latest updates about cast, plot and filming\n\nWho are the main contenders for the Democrat vice presidential office?\n\nThe main contenders for the second highest office include Josh Shapiro; Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona; Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky; and Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary.

Kamala Harris reportedly names Minnesota governor VP pick", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris has picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her own vice president should she win the election, the Associated Press and other outlets reported Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee is expected to appear with her vice presidential pick at a Tuesday campaign rally in Philadelphia.\n\nHere are some things to know about Walz.\n\nWalz, 60, was born and raised in rural Nebraska. He attended public college in Nebraska, where he met his wife, and they moved to her home state of Minnesota. He worked as a high school social studies teacher and football coach in Mankato, Minn., until he ran for Congress in 2006. He ran for governor in 2018 and won reelection in 2022. He currently chairs the Democratic governors' national campaign effort.\n\nWalz is married to his wife Gwen, and they have two children together: Hope and Gus. He credits his children with keeping him in touch with Gen Z, and with reversing his position on gun control.\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 and served 24 years, including while a member of Congress, before retiring as a command sergeant major. His military record may offer some contrast with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who served in the Marine Corps.\n\nWalz was among the first prominent Democrats to start labeling Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump \"weird,\" an attack line that Harris and her campaign have consistently repeated.\n\nHe recently explained that the anti-Trump messaging was about avoiding \"lift[ing] this guy up.\"\n\n\"Yes, he's a threat to global democracy and global peace, in my opinion,\" Walz said in a podcast interview on Pod Save America. \"I think your constitutional rights are under threat. That becomes almost overwhelming and it's not inspirational. And I think taking them down to what this is: This 'weird' thing is not an insult; it's an observation. And people saying, 'Well, Gov. Walz came up with this.' No, people are telling me this. My Republican friends are telling me this.\"\n\nWalz often appears in casual clothes, wearing jeans, T-shirts and baseball caps to official events. He frequently discusses his rural roots, and he isn't shy about using them to take digs at Vance, whose bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy documents the plight of Appalachia.\n\n\"I guarantee you he can't shoot pheasants like I can,\" Walz recently said of Vance.\n\nThe governor has also generated headlines and viral social media videos with some of his one-liners. Pointing to Vance's 2021 comment suggesting Harris was a \"childless cat lady,\" Walz quipped back: \"My God, they went after cat people. Good luck with that. Turn on the internet and see what cat people do when you go after them.\"\n\nWalz's record in office is likely to excite some progressives and draw criticism from Republicans.\n\nAs the Minneapolis Star-Tribune noted, Minnesota Democrats \"set new climate goals, pushing Minnesota to have 100% clean electricity by 2040, while creating a statewide paid leave program, legalizing marijuana for adults, passing stricter gun laws, and giving unauthorized immigrants access to driver's licenses.\"\n\nHe also signed bills into law that enshrined the right to an abortion, as well as gender-affirming care.\n\nOne aspect of his record that may come under additional scrutiny is how Minnesota's government handled the riots that followed the police murder of George Floyd in 2020. According to the Star-Tribune, \"after-action assessments of the riot response found there was a breakdown in communication between government officials.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

Tim Walz as running mate", "body": "Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, is Kamala Harris' pick to be her vice-presidential running mate, several news outlets reported early Tuesday.\n\nWalz, 60, has spent part of his adult life as a teacher and part as a politician. He's been governor of Minnesota since 2019. He served in Congress from 2017 to 2019. Before seeking his House seat, Walz was a social studies teacher who helped coach the high school football team.\n\nHe's known as outspoken -- he coined the term \"weird\" to describe the Republican presidential ticket -- and is well-liked in the party's liberal wing. Walz also has insider credibility as chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nHarris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, was seen as needing to choose someone who would be an easy fit in swing states, notably those in the Midwest.\n\nWalz provides that balance for Harris, a former California attorney general and U.S. senator who once nominated will be the first woman of color to head a major-party ticket.\n\nJust how much the vice presidential choice will make to the outcome of the November election, though, is questionable.\n\n\"Most people will base their vote on their preferences between the competing presidential candidates and the policies associated with their parties,\" said Joel Goldstein, a scholar on vice presidential history.\n\nGoldstein, a professor emeritus of law at St. Louis University, said the vice presidential choice \"may affect the outcome at the margins, either because some otherwise undecided voters prefer one of the VP candidates or because the choice sends messages about the presidential candidate's decision-making ability and values.\"\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump picked Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, for the GOP ticket last month. So far it's made no apparent difference in how the public views the campaign.\n\nVance has stirred controversy, notably as his 2021 comments about \"childless cat ladies\" went viral after he was chosen for vice president. The comments were criticized by members of both parties.\n\n\"It's early, but instead of lifting the ticket, the selection of Vance as his vice president may be a drag on Trump's re-election chances,\" said Kevin Wagner, co-director of the Public Opinion Research Lab at Florida Atlantic University, which conducts polls.\n\nMost surveys taken in the last few days show Harris in a statistical tie with Trump, who had been leading in key swing states.\n\nHarris, though, has gained some ground in many of those states thanks to the enthusiasm her candidacy has generated among Democrats since President Joe Biden left the race July 21 and endorsed her.\n\nThe states in play are seen as including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia.\n\nHarris plans to visit swing states this week, and was said to have strongly considered top Democrats from several of those states for vice president.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

His selection aims to balance the Democratic ticket, leveraging his Midwestern roots and legislative success to attract a broader base of support.\n\nHis national profile started to rise after he became the first Democrat to publicly label Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, as \"weird\" -- a narrative that has since been seized upon by Democrats.\n\nAs a vice-presidential candidate, Tim Walz was something of a dark horse. Though his name had only started to surface in recent weeks as a potential contender, he wasn't typically seen as one of the frontrunners -- especially given that Minnesota is a relatively solid blue state. Josh Shapiro, from the must-win commonwealth of Pennsylvania, was widely considered the favorite.\n\nWalz brings a unique national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher, and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. As a congressman, he represented Minnesota's 1st Congressional District -- a long-considered GOP bastion -- and was re-elected five more times.\n\nDemonstrating an ability to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, the Minnesota governor is seen as an attractive option for independents and moderate Democrats. He embodies the persona of a working-class politician with a rural background, potentially resonating with voters in key battleground states in the Midwest, and serving as a counterweight to Vance's midwestern roots.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for Newsweek, former Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, made a case for Walz as Harris' running mate. Ryan emphasized the importance of selecting a candidate who can connect with working-class voters, particularly in the Rust Belt, and highlighting Walz's understanding of issues critical to Midwestern voters, such as job creation, healthcare and education.\n\nWalz's political journey began in 2006 when he defeated a longtime Republican member of Congress in a largely rural district, a feat that has become increasingly rare in recent years. During his time in Washington, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\nWalz's political career includes significant achievements in education, healthcare and veterans' affairs. His administration has tackled issues such as opioid addiction, affordable housing, and climate change, establishing Minnesota as a model of progressive governance.\n\nHowever, Walz has faced backlash from Minnesota Republicans, particularly over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the riots following George Floyd's death and actions to protect transgender care -- a topic central to GOP campaigns.\n\nHarris and Walz will launch an aggressive, seven-state battleground tour beginning in Philadelphia on Tuesday and winding through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Her early rallies have attracted enthusiastic crowds. Campaign officials say each stop will feature local election officials, religious leaders, union members, and more to showcase the diversity of her coalition.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com",

Tim Walz as running mate, aiming to add Midwest muscle to ticket", "body": "In choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid preempting the official announcenment later Tuesday.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016.

It's been less than a month since Harris' last visit to the City of Brotherly Love, but in that time she's gone from being President Joe Biden's running mate to leading at the top of the ticket.\n\nThe speculation about Harris' running mate reached a fever pitch on Monday, with observers looking for any clue about who her pick would be. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is believed to be one of the finalists for the job, along with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. Shapiro's public schedule for Tuesday shows he will \"deliver remarks at the Harris for President event at Temple University\" at 5 p.m., which doesn't necessarily confirm whether he will get the VP nod.\n\n\"The Harris campaign is taking nothing for granted in Pennsylvania,\" Harris Pennsylvania campaign communications director Jack Doyle said Tuesday. \"We have built a massive campaign infrastructure in Pennsylvania, and we're harnessing the energy we're seeing on the ground to persuade and mobilize the voters who will decide this election.\"\n\nThe month of July began with Biden trailing in the polls after a poor debate performance in late June raised concerns about whether he could beat GOP nominee Donald Trump. Two days before the Republican National Convention, a gunman shot at Trump during a rally in Butler, killing one rally-goer and injuring two others. The following weekend, Biden bowed out of the race and immediately endorsed Harris, with Democrats quickly coalescing behind her candidacy.\n\nLate Monday, the Democratic National Committee announced Harris had secured the support of 99% of delegates to formally become the party's presidential nominee, following the conclusion of a five-day virtual vote. She is expected to formally accept the nomination at the Democratic National Convention later this month.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign raised $284.1 million between January 2023 and June 30, 2024, while Trump's campaign raised $217.2 million during that time period. Trump entered July with $128.1 million on hand, while Biden's campaign had $96 million on hand.\n\nBut Harris raised $310 million in July according to her campaign, while Trump's campaign said it raised $138 million.\n\nTrump campaigns in Harrisburg in first trip back to Pennsylvania since assassination attempt\n\nAnd although the election is still less than three months away, Pennsylvanians are already being inundated with ads and will continue to be throughout the campaign. AdImpact data showed that Trump and Harris are slated to spend more than twice as much on advertising in Pennsylvania as any of the other pivotal battleground states.\n\nPrior to Biden's exit from the race, Trump was consistently polling slightly ahead of Biden in Pennsylvania. However, since Harris emerged as the presumptive nominee, some polling shows the race in a statistical tie.\n\nTuesday will be Harris' seventh visit to Pennsylvania this year, according to the campaign. Her most recent appearance in the commonwealth was on July 13 in Philadelphia to court Asian-American voters. She's also campaigned this cycle in Pittsburgh to tout the administration's infrastructure investments, in Philadelphia to talk student debt with educators, and in Montgomery County to speak in support of reproductive rights. Harris has been the Biden administration's primary voice on abortion rights, particularly in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v.

It was an observation.\"\n\nMr Walz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues.\n\nMr Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe has often served as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television.\n\nThey have included an interview on Fox News that irritated Mr Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social: \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\"\n\nPutting Mr Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest.\n\nNo Republican has won a state-wide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nMr Trump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016.\n\nWhile Mr Biden carried Minnesota by more than seven points in 2020, Mr Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.", "source": {"uri": "yorkpress.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Press, York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Midwest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Each PredictIt bet sells for between 1\u00a2 and 99\u00a2 depending on its probability, with the customer then getting $1 if the answer they guess is correct.\n\nHowever, as of 5 a.m. ET, Shapiro had retaken the lead on the platform, with a bet on the Pennsylvania governor completing the 2024 Democratic Party ticket selling at 53\u00a2 ahead of Walz on 50\u00a2, Beshear and Kelly with 3\u00a2 each, and 1\u00a2 for Buttigieg. The PredictIt website is run out of Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nThere has been widespread speculation over who Harris would pick as her running mate since she became the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race and endorsed her. On August 5, Politico reported Harris will announce her vice-presidential selection on Tuesday ahead of a rally she is due to attend in Philadelphia in the evening.\n\nAt 5 a.m. ET on Tuesday, U.K.-based bookmaker William Hill offered odds of 8/11 (57.9 percent) on Shapiro being the 2024 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, ahead of Walz on 47.6 percent with no other candidate on more than three percent. Separately, betting website Betfair gave odds of 1/2 (66.7 percent) on Shapiro being picked, with Walz in second place on 11/8 (42.1 percent).\n\nNewsweek contacted Governor Walz's press office and representatives of Vice President Kamala Harris for comment on Tuesday by email outside of regular office hours.\n\nReuters on Monday reported that Harris had narrowed her vice-presidential shortlist down to just two candidates, Governors Walz and Shapiro.\n\nIn a message to supporters, urging them to sign up so they would receive her VP announcement, Harris on Monday said she hadn't made her final decision. She said: \"I know many of you are eager to find out who I will be selecting to join me on the campaign trail, and hopefully in the White House, as my Vice President.\n\n\"Though I have not made my decision yet, it is important to me that grassroots supporters -- like you -- have direct updates about the state of the race.\"\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Thomas Gift, a political scientist who heads the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, U.K., said selecting Shapiro as her running mate would put the key swing state of Pennsylvania \"in play\" for Harris.\n\nHe said: \"While most polling has shown Trump leading Pennsylvania by a nontrivial margin, Harris picking Shapiro puts PA's 19 electoral votes in play -- pure and simple...Even if Trump wins Pennsylvania, selecting Shapiro would force him to expend significantly more resources in the Keystone State to do it, siphoning off valuable cash and energy from other battleground states.\"\n\nA poll of 1,510 likely voters conducted between August 2 and 4 by SurveyUSA gave Harris a three-point lead over Trump on national vote share, with 48 percent versus 45 percent.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

Tim Walz as running mate, aiming to add Midwest muscle to ticket", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWalz, 60, is joining Harris during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics, promising an unpredictable campaign ahead. Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention.

Harris now leads or matches former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump in most national and swing state polls, and her campaign has pulled in record sums of money in its first fortnight.\n\nOf the $310 million (\u20ac284 million) raised in July, $200m (\u20ac183m) was donated in the week after her candidacy was announced.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and his Republican colleagues have struggled to formulate a coherent message against Harris.\n\nWhile many of the former president's outriders have tried to blame her for the Biden administration's policy on the US-Mexico border, Trump himself has caused a furore with remarks in which he accused the biracial vice president of \"turning black\".\n\nHis running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, has also attracted outrage and derision for past remarks about women -- in particular, a resurfaced interview in which he blamed those who are not raising children for the supposed decline of the US.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made,\" Vance told Fox News in 2021, \"and

Tim Walz (D-MN) to be her running mate, fewer than 100 days before the 2024 election and four years to the week that President Joe Biden tapped her to become his No. 2.\n\nHarris's choice, confirmed by the Associated Press, caps a truncated vetting process after Democrats quickly coalesced behind Harris as their replacement nominee last month after Biden suspended his reelection campaign in response to party pressure to step aside over concerns about his age, mental acuity, and electoral prospects against former President Donald Trump.\n\nHarris's decision sets a tone for her campaign and potential administration.\n\nAlmost a dozen vice presidential candidates were reportedly vetted by former President Barack Obama Attorney General Eric Holder and one-time Biden White House counsel Dana Remus, but the top three contenders became Walz, Govs. Josh Shapiro (D-PA), and Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), after Gov. Roy Cooper (D-NC) withdrew his name from consideration. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, as well as Govs. Andy Beshear (D-KY) and J.B. Pritzker (D-IL), were also said to be interviewed by Harris's vetting team and the vice president herself.\n\nHarris's calculus was reportedly predicated on whether the presumptive vice presidential nominee could help her win before helping her govern, with the desire to avoid negative press like that generated by Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) for the Trump campaign over his \"childless cat ladies\" comments. Harris's husband second gentleman Doug Emhoff and brother-in-law Tony West, who worked under Holder at the Obama Justice Department, were trusted advisers throughout.\n\nThose supporting Shapiro, 51, who became Pennsylvania's governor in 2023 after serving as the commonwealth's attorney general since 2017, contended he could help Harris win the Keystone State, whose 19 Electoral College votes will likely decide the contest. Harris can win Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin, but will still not have the 270 electoral votes needed for the presidency.\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, encountered a \"No Genocide Josh\" protest to his vice presidential candidacy, despite having similar policy positions related to the Israel-Hamas war as the other contenders. He was additionally criticized for his lack of leadership after a 2018 sexual harassment complaint was made against a former aide. The staffer was on Shapiro's payroll until last September when he resigned after the matter was settled.\n\nSimilarly to Shapiro, proponents of Kelly, 60, a former astronaut and Navy captain who was first elected to Congress in 2020, argued he could help Harris put Arizona back in play after Biden's slippage with minority voters and on issues, including the economy and the border, in the Grand Canyon State. Kelly's wife, ex-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, almost died in a shooting during a constituent event in 2011, with the couple founding the gun control advocacy and research organization, Giffords, in the aftermath. Kelly came under scrutiny for Chinese venture capital investment in the spy balloon company he started and his delay in supporting the pro-labor union PRO Act.\n\nWalz, 60, a former Army National Guardsman and social studies teacher before he ran for the House of Representatives in 2006, was thought to bring executive experience rather than a battleground state, having been Minnesota's governor since 2018. Folksy Midwestern Walz, who was favored by Biden, House Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi, and United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, was behind the Harris campaign beginning to undermine Trump and Vance as \"weird,\" with comparisons drawn between him and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's running mate.\n\nThe same arguments were made for Cooper, 67, himself a two-term, term-limited governor. Cooper had the advantage of having a pre-existing relationship with Harris from when he was North Carolina's attorney general and she was his Californian counterpart. North Carolina was the state Trump won by the smallest margin over Biden in 2020 and the Harris campaign has projected confidence about it, regardless of polling that suggests otherwise.\n\n\"This just wasn't the right time for North Carolina and for me to potentially be on a national ticket,\" Cooper posted on social media.\n\nHarris and her vice presidential pick will now embark on a five-day, seven-state battleground tour, scheduled to kick-off in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, to introduce themselves to the public and underscore what is at stake this election. He already has a Harris campaign chief of staff in Liz Allen, who was most recently the State Department's Assistant Secretary for Global Public Affairs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"In addition to holding rallies in each location along the tour, at venues ranging from big arenas to college campuses, including HBCUs, the vice president and her running mate will also take the time to meet with voters in smaller, more intimate settings, including union halls, family-owned restaurants, campaign field offices, and more,\" Harris campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt wrote in a statement. \"These stops will highlight the ticket's strength in the blue wall and Sunbelt, from urban areas to rural communities. At each stop, our new ticket will be joined by local elected officials, union members, faith leaders, and more.\"\n\nHarris announced her presidential understudy before an Aug. 7 deadline, two weeks before this cycle's Democratic National Convention, after a political fight with Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature over the Buckeye State's ballot access laws. Although Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) signed legislation extending the state's deadline so Biden and then Harris could appear on its ballots, Democrats have remained adamant Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Trump ally, could cause problems and held a virtual roll call vote instead during the last week.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naomi_lim@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Naomi Lim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Remus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana Remus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the decision.\n\nHarris wins Democratic nomination in virtual roll call. Here's how the process worked By ROBERT YOON - Associated Press\n\nIn choosing Walz, she is turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nHarris hopes to shore up her campaign's standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Republican Donald Trump's wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Republicans have rallied around Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Just weeks later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame.\n\nThe three people familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders, all of whom were white men. In landing on Walz, she sided with a low-key partner who has proven himself as a champion for Democratic causes.\n\nElections Trump is making his 2024 campaign about Harris' race, whether Republicans want him to or not By STEVE PEOPLES and MATT BROWN Associated Press\n\nWalz has been a strong public advocate for Harris in her campaign against Trump and Vance, labeling the Republicans \"just weird\" in an interview last month. Democrats have seized on the message and amplified it since then.\n\nDuring a fundraiser for Harris on Monday in Minneapolis, Walz said: \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a social studies teacher, football coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before he got into politics.\n\nHe won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district, and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military.\n\nHe ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of \"One Minnesota\" and won by more than 11 points.\n\nAs governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature that was split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. But the COVID-19 pandemic hit Minnesota early in his second year, and bipartisan cooperation soon frayed.\n\nWalz relied on emergency powers to lead the state's response. Republicans chafed under restrictions that included lockdowns, closing schools and shuttering businesses. They retaliated by firing or forcing out some of his agency heads. But Minnesotans who were stuck at home also got to know Walz better through his frequent afternoon briefings in the early days of the crisis, which were broadcast and streamed statewide.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWalz won reelection in 2022 by nearly 8 points over his GOP challenger, Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician and vaccine skeptic. Not only did Walz win, Democrats kept control of the House and flipped the Senate to win the \"trifecta\" of full control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which held that the Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion. That hurt Minnesota Republicans, especially among suburban women.\n\nCrime-courts Civil Rights Movement Freedom Riders urge younger activists to get out the vote CHARLOTTE KRAMON Associated Press/Report for America\n\n\"Tim has been in the news because the country and the world is seeing the guy we love so much,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar said Monday.\n\nKen Martin, Chairman of the Minnesota-Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party said young people he spoke to on the campaign trail were \"Walz pilled.\"\n\nWalz and other Democrats went into the 2023 legislative session with an ambitious agenda -- and a whopping $17.6 billion budget surplus to help fund it. Their proudest accomplishments included sweeping protections for abortion rights that included the elimination of nearly all restrictions Republicans had enacted in prior years, including a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements. They also enacted new protections for trans rights, making the state a refuge for families coming from out of state for treatment for trans children.\n\nTheir other major accomplishments included tax credits for families with children that were aimed at slashing childhood poverty, as well as universal free school breakfasts and lunches for all students, regardless of family income. They also enacted a paid family and medical leave program, legalized recreational marijuana for adults and made it easier to vote.\n\nElections Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' race as he appears at gathering of Black journalists By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press\n\nRepublicans complained that Walz and his fellow Democrats squandered a surplus that would have been better spent on permanent tax relief for everyone. And they've faulted the governor and his administration for lax oversight of pandemic programs that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged 70 people with defrauding federal food programs that funded meals for kids during the pandemic out of $250 million on Walz's watch. Known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, it's one of the country's largest pandemic aid fraud cases. The Office of the Legislative Auditor, a nonpartisan watchdog, delivered a scathing report in June that said Walz's Department of Education \"failed to act on warning signs,\" did not effectively exercise its authority and was ill-prepared to respond.\n\nRepublicans still criticize Walz for his response to the sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, which included the torching of a police station.\n\nDuring a May fundraiser in St. Paul, Trump repeated his false claim that he was responsible for deploying the National Guard to quell the violence. \"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was actually Walz who gave the order, which he issued in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But within Minnesota, GOP legislators said both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were too slow to act. And there was finger-pointing between Frey and Walz on who was responsible for not activating the Guard faster.\n\nWalz has served often as a Biden-Harris surrogate, and has made increasingly frequent appearances on national television. They've included an interview on Fox News that irritated Trump so much that he posted on Truth Social, \"They make me fight battles I shouldn't have to fight.\" Walz is also co-chair of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention. And he led a White House meeting of Democratic governors with Biden following the president's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nElections Russia is relying on unwitting Americans to spread election disinformation, officials say DAVID KLEPPER Associated Press\n\nPutting Walz on the ticket could help Democrats hold the state's 10 electoral votes and bolster the party more broadly in the Midwest. No Republican has won a statewide race in Minnesota since Tim Pawlenty was re-elected governor in 2006, but GOP candidates for attorney general and state auditor came close in 2022.\n\nTrump finished just 1.5 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. While Biden carried Minnesota by more than 7 points in 2020, Trump has taken to falsely claiming that he won the state last time and can do it again.\n\nMinnesota has produced two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) put his support behind Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) as Vice President Harris's potential running mate, saying he will be the one to \"speak up\" for the working class.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to talk to your governor a few days ago and I am very impressed by him,\" Sanders said Saturday in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio. \"I think you have an excellent governor who understands the needs of working families.\"\n\n\"So, I hope very much that the Vice President elects a running mate who will speak up and take on powerful corporate interests,\" he continued. \"And I think Tim Walz is somebody who could do that.\"\n\nSanders is in Minnesota for \"Get-out-the-Vote\" efforts supporting Rep. Ilhan Omar (D). He hosted a town hall in Mankato, Minn., focused on working class voters.\n\nThe Vermont senator previously withheld his endorsement of Harris, arguing he wanted to see the vice president provide more specific commitment on issues important to the working class. Sanders, who ran against Harris and President Biden in 2020, said he wanted to help shape her campaign before offering his support.\n\nIn his interview Saturday, Sanders said he will do \"everything I can\" to help Harris beat former President Trump in November. That, he said, is also part of the reason he is visiting the North Star State.\n\n\"I think she has a strong record to run on along with President Biden and I think and believe that she is going to be speaking out not only on issues of climate change, not only on issues of women having the right to control their own bodies, not only protecting our democracy, but the needs of working families,\" he said.\n\nWalz is one of the shortlisted candidates to join Harris on the ballot this fall. First elected to Congress in 2006, Walz served in Congress for 12 years before heading back to Minnesota.\n\nHouse Democrats, and progressives in particular, are pulling for their colleague because his Midwestern roots and military background counter Harris well.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) also signaled that Walz was an appealing choice because of his track record backing labor unions and working families. She said she wants someone who is pro-labor because winning working-class votes is important.\n\nWalz has been gaining national attention as Harris's rumored pick, especially since his blue-leaning state is a critical one that Democrats want to keep in the upcoming election.\n\nThe Minnesota Governor said it was \"an honor\" to be considered for the position. Harris has yet to make an announcement but revealed she would be hitting the campaign trail with her running mate next week.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_irwin@thehill.com", "name": "Lauren Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankato,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilhan_Omar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilhan Omar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramila_Jayapal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pramila Jayapal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work and Family", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Bernie-Sanders-Tim-Walz-08.03.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788903", "eventUri": "eng-9788903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Kamala is even worse than Crooked Joe,\" Trump wrote after the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points in morning trading on Friday.\n\n\"Markets will NEVER accept the Radical Left Lunatic that DESTROYED San Francisco and California, as a whole. Next move, THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF 2024! You can't play games with MARKETS.

Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are reportedly among the top contenders to be Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.\n\nShe's expected to make her decision ahead of a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nHere are key things to know about each of the possible candidates:\n\nJosh Shapiro: Shapiro, who was previously the state's attorney general, was elected in a landslide victory in 2022, defeating a 2020 election-denying far-right state senator to become the third Jewish governor elected in the crucial swing state. During a stop in Philadelphia last month, Harris called Shapiro a \"great partner to the president and me.\" The assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, placed the governor in the spotlight. His response to the death of Corey Comperatore, the Trump supporter who was killed while shielding his wife and daughter, has especially been lauded.\n\nTim Walz: Walz spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard, which included a deployment overseas after the 9/11 attacks, working as an educator and coach, before shockingly defeating a six-term Republican incumbent congressman in 2006, a wave year for Democrats. Walz remained when the tide rolled out, reelected to the typically red district repeatedly until he left to run for his current job in 2018. (The seat quickly returned to GOP control after his departure.) Walz's six years in charge of Minnesota have seen a remarkable series of political and social upheaval. First came the Covid-19 pandemic and then, in its midst, the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer, which set off global anti-racist demonstrations. Walz navigated it all - alongside more usual complaints over wasteful spending - well enough that, by the beginning of 2023, he was leading a Democratic trifecta in the state government.\n\nMark Kelly: Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly represents a state that Biden won by only 10,457 votes in 2020 and has national name recognition both as a former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. He has been a reliable supporter of Democratic Party priorities while in office but has occasionally bucked his party, such as in 2023, when he flatly called the influx of undocumented migrants across the US southern border a \"crisis.\" If Kelly was elected to higher office, his seat would remain in Democratic hands as Gov. Katie Hobbs would be able to appoint his successor.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_bradner@cnn.com", "name": "Eric Bradner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "paul_leblanc@cnn.com", "name": "Paul LeBlanc", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "karl_de_vries@cnn.com", "name": "Karl De Vries", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Tim Walz, a Democrat, talks about new gun controls Thursday at Bloomington City Hall. (Stephen Maturen/Stringer/Getty Images)\n\nPresumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is expected to announce her vice president pick Tuesday, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz may be her second-most-likely choice.\n\nProfessional oddsmaking companies BetOnline, Oddschecker, Polymarket, and PredictIT all show Walz behind Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as Harris' most likely pick, The Center Square reported.\n\nBecause of his rural Midwestern heritage and military background, Walz has been touted as a safe choice for vice president for Harris, despite his far-left stances on transgender procedures for children and abortion on demand.\n\nBorn in Nebraska, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard after graduating high school. He graduated from Nebraska's Chadron State College with a social science degree in 1989.\n\nWalz spent a year teaching abroad before returning home to serve in the Army National Guard. He later took a high school teaching and coaching position.\n\nAfter meeting his future wife, Gwen, Walz moved to Mankato, Minnesota, where both taught at a high school. Walz advised Mankato West High School's first gay-straight alliance club.\n\nThe Walzes have two children, Hope and Gus.\n\nA year after retiring from the National Guard in 2005, Walz won his race for the U.S. House of Representatives. He was reelected five times.\n\nElected as Minnesota governor in 2018, he won reelection in 2022.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may be rooting for Walz behind the scenes. Pelosi said she \"is always especially fond of former House colleagues\" when asked about Harris' choice for a running mate, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told Minnesota Public Radio that he supports Walz for vice president, saying the Minnesota governor would \"speak up\" for the working class.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to talk to your governor a few days ago and I am very impressed by him,\" Sanders said in that Minnesota-based interview. \"I think you have an excellent governor who understands the needs of working families.\"\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who came under fire in mid-July for calling Israel \"a racist state,\" pointed to Walz's track record backing labor unions and working families as a key reason for her support.\n\n\"I want somebody who's really strongly pro-labor and understands labor, because this is a big part of the working-class agenda and making sure that we win working-class votes,\" Jayapal said.\n\n\"I like the things that he's been able to do,\" she added. \"I like that he's from a rural town; I like that he's got a military background.\"\n\nIn January 2023, Walz signed into law Minnesota legislation that includes no limitations on when a woman may end the life of her unborn baby.\n\n\"To Minnesotans, know that your access to reproductive health, and your right to make your own health care decisions, are preserved and protected,\" Walz said then of the so-called Protect Reproductive Options Act. \"And because of this law, that won't change with the political winds and the makeup of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe legislation reads: \"Every individual has a fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about the individual's own reproductive health, including the fundamental right to use or refuse reproductive health care.\"\n\n\"Reproductive health care\" is a euphemism for abortion.\n\nWalz issued an executive order ensuring that Minnesota children may obtain irreversible transgender surgeries and sterilizing hormone treatments, which proponents call \"gender-affirming care.\" The measures made Minnesota a \"trans refuge,\" supporters said.\n\nWhile signing his executive order, Walz held the hand of 12-year-old boy who said he identified as a transgender girl.\n\nWalz's executive order prevents other states from taking \"child protection\" action against parents who help their children \"transition\" to a boy or girl. According to the order, a parent in another state may not take custody action against a parent in Minnesota who is transitioning a child.\n\n\"We want every Minnesotan to grow up feeling safe, valued, protected, celebrated, and free to exist as their authentic versions of themselves,\" Walz said. \"Protecting and supporting access to gender-affirming health care is essential to being a welcoming and supportive state.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_mitchell@dailysignal.com", "name": "Elizabeth Mitchell",

Who is he, and the big question is, is he good for the cryptocurrency industry?\n\nHumble beginnings\n\nThe Minnesota governor was raised in Nebraska and taught at a public school in a small city in Minnesota. He was also the coach of a high school football team and was a 24-year veteran with the Army National Guard.\n\n\"When you look at Tim Walz, what you have is someone with a lived experience that is so comparable to so many people in rural America who are willing to maybe reconsider just blindly voting for the Republican Party candidate,\" said former Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.\n\nPolitical career\n\nReportedly a \"finalist\" in Harris' list of running mate picks, Walz served as House representative for Minnesota from 2007 through 2019. He has been the state's governor since 2019.\n\nSome rural Democrats have reportedly been pushing Harris to pick a mate who has had experience running and winning in areas where races have been close, as per Politico. Rep. J.D. Scholten of Iowa is one of the leaders who believe Walz brings \"balance\" to the table.\n\nPolymarket traders drive Walz's chances\n\nOn Polymarket, where users buy and trade cryptocurrencies to bet on future events, traders pushed Walz's odds of becoming the Democratic vice presidential nominee 58%, compared to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's 41% Monday night.\n\nOther potential nominees such as Mark Kelly, Andy Beshear, and Pete Buttigieg were all on the 1% mark.\n\nWhat has Walz said about crypto?\n\nThere is so far no record of Walz saying anything about digital assets or the crypto industry in public. On the other hand, he has signed a bill into law that states Minnesota must transition to 100% clean energy by 2040. Sustainable energy is a critical matter within the Bitcoin mining sector, as many miners struggle to move toward cleaner energy sources during heightened competition and increased costs.\n\nIn contrast, Pennsylvania under Shapiro is open to Bitcoin mining, with some of the country's biggest companies having set up mining facilities in the state, including TeraWulf, which utilizes over 90% zero-carbon energy in its operations. However, Shapiro is embroiled in a lawsuit over alleged environmental pollution and tax credit abuse related to a $BTC miner.\n\nBoth Walz and Shapiro have yet to discuss Bitcoin or crypto publicly. Harris has also not directly criticized the industry nor encouraged the use of digital assets.\n\nOther potential picks\n\nKelly and Beshear, who have been floated among the people on Harris' initial list of potential running mates, have somehow been involved in the sector. Beshear tried to attract more Bitcoin miners into Kentucky, but not without controversy.\n\nKelly was among one of a dozen Democratic senators who voted in favor of a bill that sought to overturn the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which President Joe Biden vetoed.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

What to know about Kamala Harris' pick for vice president", "body": "As governor of Minnesota, Walz has made school lunches free for all students, created a paid family and medical leave program, increased public school funding, legalized recreational marijuana, and made abortion a fundamental right under state law.\n\nA former football coach, high school teacher, and veteran with rural roots could be the next vice president of the United States.\n\nKamala Harris on Tuesday picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate, capping off weeks of speculation over who she'd choose.\n\nHarris, who became the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month and endorsed her, made her selection Tuesday morning, according to CNN, Reuters, and the Washington Post.\n\nWhen he turned 17, he joined the Army National Guard. During the 24 years he served in the military, Walz went from artillery specialist to command sergeant major. His tenure included postings around the US and in Europe and a deployment overseas after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nWalz then went on to pursue a career in education after using his GI benefits to earn a bachelor's degree from Chadron State College and a master's degree from Minnesota State University, Mankato.\n\nHis first teaching job was on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, one of the poorest areas in the country. He then became one of the first American teachers authorized to teach high school in China. After returning from China, Walz taught high school geography and coached football for over 20 years in Minnesota.\n\nWalz first got involved in politics in 2004, when he volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign.\n\nFrom there, he decided to run against incumbent Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht in Minnesota's 1st district two years later. Walz beat Gutknecht, and served as one of the few Democrats in Congress from a rural district for 12 years before being elected governor of Minnesota in 2018.\n\nWalz was also the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress at the time of his election.\n\nDuring Walz's first term as governor, he was limited by a divided legislature, as Republicans controlled the state Senate. But after Walz won reelection and Democrats won full control of the Minnesota legislature in the 2022 elections, they successfully passed one of the most ambitious policy agendas of the past 60 years.\n\nUsing a nearly $4 billion dollar budget surplus last year, Walz and the legislature gave working- and middle-class Minnesotans tax rebates of $1,000 per individual or $2,000 per couple, approved 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for workers, and established a child tax credit to help working families.\n\nUnder Walz's leadership, Minnesota also dramatically increased funding for public schools, invested over $1 billion in child care and early learning opportunities, made public college free for students with a family income under $80,000, invested $1 billion to expand access to affordable housing, banned medical debt from impacting credit scores, banned hidden scam fees, and lowered the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nWalz also signed into law bills that legalized recreational marijuana, made abortion a fundamental right under state law, implemented universal background checks for gun sales, and increased protections for workers in Amazon warehouses, construction sites, hospitals, nursing homes, and public schools.\n\nThose achievements represented a turnaround from Walz's first term, which saw him faced with the twin crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.\n\nWhile Walz had received praise for his role in passing the barrage of legislation in Minnesota, he had not become a national figure until after Biden dropped out of the race. But over the past two weeks, Walz's profile skyrocketed nationwide as he emerged as one of the most effective critics of the Republican party.\n\nWalz was the first high-level elected official to call the Trump-Vance ticket as \"weird\" and \"strange\" -- a message since adopted by wide swaths of the Democratic Party.\n\nWalz was also able to paint a stark contrast between what Democrats like Kamala Harris and himself wanted and the Republican agenda, ultimately persuading Harris that he was the right person to stand by her side heading into November.", "source": {"uri":

Kamala is even worse than Crooked Joe,\" Trump wrote after the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points in morning trading on Friday.\n\n\"Markets will NEVER accept the Radical Left Lunatic that DESTROYED San Francisco and California, as a whole. Next move, THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF 2024! You can't play games with MARKETS. KAMALA CRASH!!!\" said Trump.\n\nThe stock market drop has been linked by economists to a less-than-stellar jobs growth report released on Friday morning.\n\nThe report showed that 114,000 news jobs were added to the US economy in July - below the expected 175,000 - signaling a potential recession.\n\nIn another post, Trump wrote: \"Voters have a choice - Trump prosperity, or the Kamala Crash &

But her pick is still unknown - Times of India", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris is set to announce her new running mate at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening, but the identity of her choice remains under wraps until the event. Harris's campaign has been tight-lipped, with the announcement expected to come via a video message shortly before the rally, similar to how Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential pick in 2020.\n\nPotential finalists\n\nIn recent days, Harris has focused on three potential candidates: Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The decision is yet to be publicly disclosed, creating considerable anticipation as the event approaches.\n\nCampaign and scheduling\n\nThe rally in Philadelphia, where Harris and her new running mate will appear alongside second gentleman Doug Emhoff, marks a significant moment in her campaign, following her recent transition to the top of the Democratic ticket. After the rally, Harris and her running mate will embark on a five-day tour of key battleground states, including Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit. However, a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, may be delayed due to Tropical Storm Debby's impact, and rain could also affect a scheduled visit to Durham, North Carolina.\n\nRepublican counterprogramming\n\nThe Trump campaign has anticipated the Harris announcement by scheduling an early speech in Philadelphia from Senator JD Vance, who has been positioned to counter Harris's debut. Vance's campaign plans to follow Harris's tour with its own events in Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina. The Trump campaign has criticized Harris and Democratic policies, blaming them for economic and social issues.\n\nDemocratic reactions and issues\n\nHarris's campaign has embraced the overlap with Vance's events, viewing it as an opportunity to highlight the stark contrast between the Democratic and Republican visions. The campaign has invited various community leaders to participate in upcoming events, from large arenas to local venues, in an effort to engage a broad spectrum of voters.\n\nControversies and criticisms\n\nThe choice of running mate has sparked some controversy. Shapiro, a potential pick, faces criticism from some Arab American and activist groups due to his stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict. Kelly's selection might address immigration concerns but has drawn some skepticism from union leaders. Walz has been vocal in his criticism of Trump, a stance that has resonated within Democratic circles.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Josh Shapiro is scheduled to speak at today's Kamala Harris campaign event in Philly, her fifth trip to the region in just the last couple of months.\n\nAll eyes will be on Philadelphia Tuesday as Kamala Harris takes the stage alongside her 2024 running mate.\n\nBut, we don't know yet who that will be.\n\nMonday went by without word from the Harris campaign about her vice presidential nominee, whom she's picking just 16 days after Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign. She'll reportedly make her choice public in a video shared online prior to the rally, the same method Biden used four years ago to announce Harris as his vice presidential pick.\n\nCNN reported earlier that the campaign plans to officially announce Harris' choice for a running mate through an online message to supporters before the rally, where she's expected to make her first appearance with her pick.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro appears to remain seriously under consideration to join her campaign after reportedly being interviewed on Sunday. He spent Monday in Harrisburg before returning to his home in Jenkintown to shoot some hoops in his driveway.\n\nOther candidates reportedly vying for the job are Minnesota Gov. Tim Waltz, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who appeared at a fundraiser for the Harris campaign in Chicago on Monday.\n\nIt's Harris' fifth trip to Philadelphia region in just the last couple of months, though it's her first as the Democratic presidential nominee. On May 8, she joined Abbott Elementary star Sheryl Lee Ralph in Montgomery County to highlight reproductive rights, and on May 21 she delivered the keynote address at the 2024 Service Employees International Union's international convention. On May 29, Harris joined Biden during a rally at Girard College, the historic boarding school in Fairmount, aimed at shoring up support with Black voters.\n\nHarris is scheduled to attend a campaign rally at the Liacouras Center, the 10,000-seat basketball arena on Temple University's campus Tuesday evening. She's expected to speak around 5:30 p.m.\n\nIt will be Harris' first campaign stop in Philadelphia since becoming the Democratic nominee.\n\nIt's the same venue where former President Donald Trump held a campaign event in June. It was the first rally he has ever held in Philadelphia, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 7-to-1- margin. In 2020, Trump received only 5% of the vote in precincts within a half-mile radius of Temple's campus.\n\n\"I was like, Philly? Is he sure?\" Tom Mathena, a Trump supporter and construction worker from Wilmington, told The Inquirer.\n\nYes.\n\nRegardless if he ends up as Harris' running mate, Shapiro is scheduled to deliver remarks at the Liacouras Center around 5 p.m., according to the governor's office.\n\nWhile the Secret Service doesn't provide the routes for obvious reasons, there will likely be rolling closures on both I-95 and I-676 as Harris makes her way to and from the airport to the Liacouras Center.\n\nPolice said delays and closures are expected in the immediate vicinity surrounding the Liacouras Center Tuesday.\n\nFollowing her rally in Philadelphia Tuesday, Harris is scheduled to stay on a road this week in a blitz of battleground states.\n\nOn Wednesday Harris and her yet-to-be-named running mate will travel to Detroit and Eau Claire, Wisc, followed by a trip to Raleigh, N.C. on Thursday. A planned stop in Savannah, Ga. on Thursday was postponed by her campaign due to the impact of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nShe'll cap off her travels with a stop in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\n\" READ MORE: Presidential campaign schedules for Tuesday include Philly stops for both Harris and Vance\n\nHours before Harris takes the stage at the Liacouras Center, Sen. JD Vance (R., Ohio) is also slated to speak at an event in Philadelphia.\n\nVance, Trump's running mate, is scheduled to attend a campaign event at 2300 Arena on South Swanson Street in South Philly. Doors are scheduled to open at 10 a.m., and Vance is slated to speak at noon, according to the Trump campaign.\n\nIt is Vance's first campaign stop in Philadelphia since being named Trump's running mate last month. Vance will also mirror Harris' blitz of battleground states this week, attending his own campaign events in Detroit, Eau Claire, Wisc., and Raleigh, N.C.\n\n\" READ MORE: JD Vance, Trump's running mate, is traveling to Philadelphia Tuesday. Here's what to know.\n\nThat remains unclear, especially with Harris still mulling over potential running mates.\n\nA vice presidential debate had been scheduled to take place at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., on Sept. 25, but the event was canceled.\n\nThere might not be another presidential debate, either. Trump backed out of a debate on ABC that, prior to Joe Biden dropping out of the race, had been scheduled for Sept. 10. In its place, Trump proposed a debate on Fox News on Sept. 4 in Pennsylvania that would involve a live audience.\n\n\"I'll be there on September 10, like he agreed to,\" Harris wrote on social media. \"I hope to see him there.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place on Aug. 19 through Aug. 22 at the United Center in Chicago. The stadium is home to both the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nWhile the primary role of the DNC is to nominate the Democratic candidate for president, Harris officially became the party's presidential candidate Monday night, thanks to a virtual role call vote. Harris,\n\nDemocrats held the early vote due to the threat Harris wouldn't appear on Ohio's ballot if they waited until after Aug. 7, the original deadline the state set for parties to submit their certified candidate's names. While lawmakers pushed that date back to Sept. 1, Democrats stuck with the virtual roll call vote due to the threat of lawsuits from conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"If we take chances with state processes and deadlines, Republican groups could make the argument to challenge Democratic votes on the post-election side, arguing that our nominee should never have been on the ballot in the first place,\" DNC outside counsel Pat Moore told CBS News.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She specializes in gender issues and abortion rights, which she has been covering for seven years. Her work has also appeared in The Lily, Insider, Cosmopolitan, GEN by Medium, and Refinery29, among other outlets.\n\nKamala Harris has picked Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate, according to CNN and the Associated Press. The 60-year-old beat out several popular contenders for the VP spot, including Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear. The Harris campaign is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday, and the two will make their first appearance together at a Philadelphia rally.\n\nThough Walz does not come from a battleground state, allies believe he can help strengthen the \"blue wall\" and provide a boost to the Democratic ticket in other swing states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin -- all of which are critical for Harris to secure the White House. He has also been an effective surrogate for the Harris campaign over the past several weeks. Walz was the force behind Democrats' new line of attack branding Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, as \"weird,\" and voters have responded enthusiastically to his news appearances.\n\nWalz is a longtime public servant. He was born in Nebraska, growing up in a small rural community where his high-school graduating class was made up of 25 students -- 12 of which were Walz's cousins. After serving in the National Guard, he spent two decades working as a public high-school teacher and football coach. Later, he was elected to Congress and represented a largely red-leaning, rural district for 12 years.\n\nHe was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018. Since securing a Democratic trifecta in 2022, Walz has implemented a slew of progressive policies in the state, including protecting and expanding abortion rights; making breakfast and lunch free for all students, regardless of income status; restoring voting rights for felons; and requiring that utilities in the state move toward a 100 percent clean-energy model by 2040.\n\nA Harris-Walz win would mean that the governor must resign from his role before the inauguration takes place on January 20, 2025. Per Minnesota's state Constitution, Democratic lieutenant governor Peggy Flanagan would succeed him as governor, and the president of the state Senate, Democratic senator Bobby Joe Champion, would become lieutenant governor. They'd serve in the roles for the remainder of Walz's four-year term, which is set to end in January 2027.", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cut"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_gonzalez_ramirez@thecut.com", "name": "Andrea Gonz\u00e1lez-Ram\u00edrez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medium (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Kentucky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_(United_States)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinery29", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refinery29"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nAlso Read | Hiroshima, Nagasaki Atomic Bombings: Lok Sabha Pays Tributes to Victims of Nuclear Bomb Attack in Japanese Cities in August 1945.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been announced\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\nAlso Read | Suicide Cases in South Korea: Number of Suicides in Country Jumps Over 10% in 2024, Shows Government Data.\n\nDoing so would be similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden revealed Harris as his vice presidential choice during the pandemic-marred presidential race of 2020.\n\nIt will be yet another milestone in the barely two weeks since the vice president moved to take over the top of the Democratic ticket heading into November's election. She has been scrambling to build out a campaign since then, and to breathe new life into the Democratic race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and her No. 2 pick are set to appear together for an evening rally in Philadelphia, recalling a joint 2020 appearance by Biden and Harris in Wilmington, Delaware. Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appeared with Hillary Clinton in Miami.\n\nAfter Tuesday's day trip to Pennsylvania, Harris and her running mate will spend the next five days flying thousands of miles around the country, touring critical battleground states.\n\nThey'll visit Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Detroit on Wednesday. But a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby's effects, and rain associated with it could also upend a scheduled stop in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nLater in the week, Harris and her No. 2 will head to Phoenix and Las Vegas.

Vance of Ohio, who have struggled to respond to strong support for Harris since President Joe Biden announced last month that he was withdrawing from the campaign and threw his support behind his vice-president.\n\nHarris is the first woman of colour at the top of a major party\u2019s ticket, a possible liability in the Democratic Party\u2019s efforts to win over conservative voters, and a key reason that she had been expected to choose a white man as her running mate.\n\nRepublicans have also labelled Harris a \u201cCalifornia liberal\u201d, giving her more reason to choose someone from a Republican-leaning or swing state to join her.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Walz gives Harris more momentum in polls, which have shown her roughly even with Trump, and in some cases slightly ahead. Trump\u2019s pick of Vance has been widely seen as dragging the former president\u2019s standing in the polls, giving rise to talk that he may switch to another running mate.\n\nThe latest polling averages compiled by 538.com show Vance with an unfavourable rating of 39.6 per cent, and a favourable rating of 31.3 per cent, numbers that have steadily moved against him since Trump made his selection.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

If those names are unfamiliar to you, count yourself among the majority of Americans who don't know or have never heard of the Democrats who could be the next vice president, according to an NPR/PBS News Marist poll.\n\nThe survey found Kelly has the highest favorability of the three candidates for the No. 2 job in the White House, 31% favorable to 18% unfavorable, but 52% of respondents still said they were unsure or have never heard of him.\n\nShapiro, who is speculated to be the front-runner in the veepstakes since Harris will make her first appearance with her running mate in Philadelphia, has a 25%-23% favorable to unfavorable rating. Still, 53% of Americans are unsure.\n\nHARRIS HOURS AWAY FROM MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER CAREER\n\nAs for Walz, the progressive favorite is by far the most unknown of the three, with 71% of survey respondents saying they were unsure or had never heard of him.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris has improved her favorability numbers, which are now 46-48% favorable-unfavorable compared to 40-44% in the previous Marist survey.\n\nThe Republican nominee, former President Trump, is viewed mostly unfavorable, 53%, in contrast to 44% of respondents who have a positive view of the GOP candidate. Trump's unfavorable score increased four points since the last Marist poll, which was taken right after the Republican National Convention and the assassination attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe survey of 1,613 adults was conducted between Thursday and Sunday and has a +/- 3.3 percentage point margin of error. Respondents were contacted via cellphone, landline or online research panels in both English and Spanish.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS HOLDING RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA TO INTRODUCE RUNNING MATE AFTER SECURING DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION\n\nHarris is scheduled to announce her selection at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening.\n\nThis will be Harris' first visit to Pennsylvania as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, after formerly securing the nomination on Monday. The trip also marks her seventh visit to the commonwealth this year and the 17th since she was sworn in as vice president in 2021.\n\nKelly, Shapiro and Walz are the finalists for the VP job in a truncated vetting process after President Biden shocked the nation by dropping out of the 2024 race and endorsed Harris to succeed him.\n\nHarris was in Washington, D.C., over the weekend conducting in-person interviews with her potential running mates, Democratic sources confirmed to Fox News. Others under consideration include Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and JB Pritzker of Illinois, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nIT'S OFFICIAL: VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS FORMALLY WINS THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION\n\nAhead of her meetings with the contenders, Harris was briefed by a vetting team led by former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe rollout of the announcement is not known, but it's likely it could come through a video introduction, similar to how Biden announced Harris as his running mate four years ago. But the Harris campaign's plans could be upended on Monday or Tuesday by a media leak of the announcement.\n\nAfter the rally in Philadelphia, Harris and her to-be-named running mate will team for an ambitious and jam-packed swing state tour through Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, the seven battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe vice president drew over 10,000 at her first major rally since taking over for Biden at the top of the Democrats' ticket, last week at the Georgia State Convocation Center in Atlanta.\n\nHarris will be shadowed on her tour by Republican candidate for vice president JD Vance, forces confirmed to Fox News. The Ohio senator will act as the Trump campaign's attack dog, attempting to persuade voters against Harris in key swing states.\n\nFox News Digital's Paul Steinhauser and Landon Mion contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_pandolfo@foxnews.com", "name": "Chris Pandolfo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marist College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Collins_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Collins (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends_First", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends First"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Tim Walz as her VP pick: reports", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nWalz, 60, has served both in Congress and as Minnesota governor, boasting an expansive resume that set him a part from the other two reported finalists, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.\n\nA Republican presidential nominee has not won Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972, but the Trump campaign is optimistic that they can make the state competitive. The former president held a rally in Minnesota not long before Walz's selection was announced.\n\nLike others who wanted to join the ticket, Walz made sure to complete a media blitz in recent days. During his quasi audition, the Minnesotan showed that he was more than willing to embrace the \"attack dog\" role often adopted by running mates. Walz blasted Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee, as someone who didn't understand what small town America was really about.\n\n\"What I know is that people like JD Vance know nothing about small town America,\" Walz recently told MSNBC. \"My town had 400 people in it, 2,400 kids in my graduating class, 12 were cousins, and he gets it all wrong. It's not about hate. It's not about collapsing in. The golden rule is mind your own damn business. Their policies are what have destroyed rural America.\"\n\nAs governor, Walz has signed a raft of liberal priorities into law, including a guarantee for paid family and medical leave, protection of abortion rights, universal background checks on firearms, and recreational marijuana. He also led the state through the response to unrest and riots after George Floyd's murder in 2020. Voters handed Democrats narrow control of the state Senate in 2022, giving Walz a trifecta to kick off his second term and paving the wave for many of his achievements in St. Paul.\n\nVirtually unknown on the national stage, Walz has expanded his profile since being elected chair of the powerful Democratic Governors Association. Two former chairs, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, went on to become US presidents. Walz is also the co-chair of the Democratic National Convention's Rules Committee, which has put him in the middle of the fight over holding a virtual vote before the actual convention kicks off in Chicago on August 19.\n\nHarris' campaign is likely to tout Walz's biography as one that's similar to that of many Americans, especially in the Midwest.\n\nWalz grew up in rural Nebraska. At 17, he enlisted in the Army National Guard and spent 24 years in the Guard. He attended Chadron State College, a public university, before following in his father's footsteps and becoming a teacher. According to the Omaha World Herald, Walz's first teaching job was on the Pine Ridge Reservation, home to the Oglala Lakota tribe.\n\nWalz met his wife, Gwen, while teaching in Nebraska. The couple later moved to Minnesota. Walz has been open about how he and his wife needed in vitro fertilization in order to have children.\n\nWhen Walz launched his first run for Congress in 2005, he was still teaching high school. In 2006, he ousted Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht during a banner year for Democrats, who retook both houses in Congress as the nation turned against the war in Iraq.\n\nWalz represented his mostly rural district, which bordered Iowa, for six terms.\n\nAccording to GovTrack, Walz crafted a centrist record over his 12 years in Congress, likely a testament to a district that has conservative leanings. In 2018, Republicans won back the House seat.\n\nDuring Walz's five reelection campaigns, he boasted an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association, according to MinnPost. But when Walz ran for governor, he said his perspective on the issue had changed.\n\nWalz's selection gives the party a credible Midwestern voice at the highest level of Democratic politics, a major asset as the campaign sees victories in Michigan and Wisconsin as a core part of its electoral calculus in November.\n\nWhile Republicans are poised to win most rural locales across the Midwest, Democrats aren't giving up on those areas. If the Harris-Walz ticket can dominate in urban areas while also winning smaller cities and tamping down the GOP's rural margins, they have a chance to perform at levels not seen since President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_l_dorman@businessinsider.com", "name": "John L.

JD Vance (R., Ohio), Trump's vice presidential nominee, who is scheduled to appear in South Philadelphia. Vance's stop is slated to take place at the 2300 Arena at Ritner and Swanson Streets around noon Tuesday.\n\nVance's Philly appearance marks his first since Trump named him as his running mate, but it is not likely to be his last in the Keystone State. Trump reportedly has said Vance will practically be living in Pennsylvania ahead of the November election as the campaign works to use the Ohio senator's rural upbringing to attract voters in the neighboring state.\n\n\" READ MORE: JD Vance, Trump's running mate, is traveling to Philadelphia Tuesday. Here's what to know.\n\nThe Philly event comes following Harrisburg rally last week, which took place at a sold out New Holland Arena in the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex and marked Trump's first appearance in Pennsylvania since he survived an assassination attempt in Butler on July 13.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, is slated to appear at Temple University's Liacouras Center Tuesday evening. The event will be Harris' first rally with her as-yet-unnamed running mate, and serves as the kickoff of a multi-state campaign tour that has scheduled stops in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada, according to the White House.\n\nWhile Harris' running mate has not yet publicly been named, the Associated Press reports that she spoke with six candidates over the weekend: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. An announcement regarding her pick is expected to come at any time.\n\nShapiro, who is considered among the front-runners for the position, remained mum about his chances when he arrived in Harrisburg Monday morning, telling an Associated Press reporter, \"I got nothing for you, man.\" He is expected to appear at Harris' Philadelphia event Tuesday.\n\nHarris' stop will be the second time this summer that the Liacouras Center has hosted a presidential rally. Trump held a campaign event there in June.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_vadala@inquirer.com", "name": "Nick Vadala", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Farm_Show_Complex_&_Expo_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex & Expo Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Philadelphia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Josh Shapiro, 51, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, sources told CNN, although Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon. Shapiro is a rising Democratic star whose popularity in the commonwealth could be an asset to Harris in perhaps the most vital swing state. Walz is an experienced progressive leader whose profile could help shore up the midwestern blue wall states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, that may represent Harris' best route to the Oval Office.\n\nThe theatrics will offer the vice president a fresh chance to supercharge her candidacy's momentum, which has energized a party that had looked headed for defeat in November and tightened the contest into a 50-50 struggle in a polarized country. Her relative youth, at 59, has inverted the generational contrast with Trump, 78, now that the issue of Biden's age and acuity in a potential second term is moot.\n\nWhile the naming of the Democratic vice presidential pick is the focus of the campaign, new developments Monday -- outside a race that has been on a momentous trajectory since Trump escaped an assassination attempt and Biden pulled out -- hinted at potential new twists to come before November.\n\nEconomic and Middle East drama loom as Harris makes her pick\n\nHarris' final deliberations took place against a backdrop of fast-developing domestic and global events that reflected the complex political environment she must navigate if the novelty of her sudden elevation wears off.\n\nA global stock market plunge, for instance, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,000 points Monday, amid rising unemployment and revived fears of a US recession that could further sour voters on an economy that the White House insists is in great shape but that has nevertheless left millions of people feeling deeply insecure. There is no sign that the US economy faces a looming meltdown on the scale of the 2008 crisis that helped lead to the victory of Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain. The banking system appears strong, inflation has ebbed and the US has bounced back more strongly than other developed nations from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nStill, in a tight election likely to be decided by a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states, any issue can be decisive. Any economic shocks in the weeks to come could prove treacherous for Harris given she's tied to the current administration but also lacks the ability to influence factors like whether the Federal Reserve will begin to make long-awaited interest rate cuts.\n\nHarris on Monday also had to juggle discussions on her pick with her official duties. She joined Biden in the White House Situation Room amid intense diplomacy as signs point to an Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel that would risk igniting a full-scale regional war that could drag in the United States. News that several US service members were injured in a suspected rocket attack on an air base in Iraq again underscored the many factors that are beyond the vice president's control that could rock the race in the run-up to November. Multiple US officials told CNN that the US expects Iran to hit back for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran perhaps within a 24-hour time frame -- a period that could coincide with the vice president's plans to name her running mate.\n\nThe Middle East war has already had a significant impact on the campaign. Israel's repeated disregard for Biden's calls to shield civilians in its assault on Hamas in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks has carved splits in the Democratic coalition, especially in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which is home to many Arab Americans.\n\nThe war has also loomed over Harris' search for a running mate since Shapiro, who is Jewish, is being criticized by some on the left for comments condemning the tone of campus protests. While he has been more outspokenly critical about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than Biden has, some progressives have warned against his selection as a running mate.\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss on Monday criticized a campaign from what he described as the \"overly online left\" against Shapiro's possible nomination. \"There's a strong undercurrent of antisemitism to that,\" the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN's Kasie Hunt.\n\nTrump seeks opening as he struggles to deal with Harris\n\nTrump, who has struggled to adapt his campaign to his new Democratic foe, sought to exploit both evolving crises on Monday in a way that pointed to a potentially more effective attack against Harris than his questioning of her racial identify last week. He blasted the stock sell off as a \"Kamala Crash\" on social media and warned World War III was beckoning.\n\nThe ex-president's comments lacked context and were overly alarmist. But perception is often as important as reality in a presidential race. Trump is seeking to tie Harris to what he claims are Biden's failures as he seeks to foster a sense among Americans that the country and the world are fast spinning out of control.\n\nAt the very least, the economy and Middle East instability will increase pressure on Harris to do more to counter Trump's populist economic arguments and to flesh out how she would lead at a time when US global power is more challenged than it's been in decades.\n\nA critical choice\n\nThe choice of a running mate is the first, most critical decision a party nominee makes. They, after all, are choosing a potential commander in chief who they deem fit to serve as president should the worst happen to them.\n\nBut while the pick generates huge public interest, fundraising potential and can bolster a presidential nominee's narrative or compensate for their liabilities, it's been years since a vice presidential selection has been the decisive factor in winning an election.\n\nThe most important tactical consideration for Harris, therefore, may be to ensure her choice does nothing to detract from her successful rollout -- either in action or by the exposure of past deeds. Any mistakes in vetting her choice could offer Trump and his campaign a chance to pick apart a poorly vetted candidacy and regain some traction.\n\nThe vice president has just witnessed an object lesson in the perils of running mate politics. Trump and his team have spent two weeks having to defend his pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, after his past reference to Democratic politicians as \"childless cat ladies\" contributed to the rockiest rollout of any vice presidential pick since Republican Sarah Palin in 2008. The Harris campaign will be seeking a scandal-free rollout and a triumphant swing state tour that keeps Trump off balance for another week and allows her to ride into the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on a political high in two weeks.\n\nTuesday's events in Philadelphia would have been unthinkable less than three weeks ago when Biden was resisting growing Democratic efforts to push him aside after his disastrous June debate performance in Atlanta. At the time, the 2024 race -- which promises sweeping consequences for America's democracy and future path -- was still reeling from the attempt to kill Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania just before he claimed his third-straight GOP nomination.\n\nThe contest for the White House had previously been shaped by Trump's multiple legal woes, but the success of his courtroom delaying tactics and assists from conservative judges have pushed off a reckoning for his most serious alleged offenses - including his attempt to steal the 2020 election that he lost in a bid to remain in power.\n\nStill, Harris' strong start appears to have restored the election to a neck-and-neck race, according to recent surveys. In the latest CNN Poll of Polls, for instance, there was no clear leader nationally with Trump at 49% and Harris at 47%. But the vice president's campaign is so new that it's too early to judge the full impact of her entry into the race, especially without a critical mass of new swing state data.\n\nA successful rollout of her running mate offers the prospect of another few weeks of positive vibes in a transformed race -- if outside events don't intervene.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Josh Shapiro, 51, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, sources told CNN, although Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon. Shapiro is a rising Democratic star whose popularity in the commonwealth could be an asset to Harris in perhaps the most vital swing state. Walz is an experienced progressive leader whose profile could help shore up the midwestern blue wall states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, that may represent Harris' best route to the Oval Office.\n\nThe theatrics will offer the vice president a fresh chance to supercharge her candidacy's momentum, which has energized a party that had looked headed for defeat in November and tightened the contest into a 50-50 struggle in a polarized country. Her relative youth, at 59, has inverted the generational contrast with Trump, 78, now that the issue of Biden's age and acuity in a potential second term is moot.\n\nWhile the naming of the Democratic vice presidential pick is the focus of the campaign, new developments Monday -- outside a race that has been on a momentous trajectory since Trump escaped an assassination attempt and Biden pulled out -- hinted at potential new twists to come before November.\n\nHarris' final deliberations took place against a backdrop of fast-developing domestic and global events that reflected the complex political environment she must navigate if the novelty of her sudden elevation wears off.\n\nA global stock market plunge, for instance, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,000 points Monday, amid rising unemployment and revived fears of a US recession that could further sour voters on an economy that the White House insists is in great shape but that has nevertheless left millions of people feeling deeply insecure. There is no sign that the US economy faces a looming meltdown on the scale of the 2008 crisis that helped lead to the victory of Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain. The banking system appears strong, inflation has ebbed and the US has bounced back more strongly than other developed nations from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nStill, in a tight election likely to be decided by a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states, any issue can be decisive. Any economic shocks in the weeks to come could prove treacherous for Harris given she's tied to the current administration but also lacks the ability to influence factors like whether the Federal Reserve will begin to make long-awaited interest rate cuts.\n\nHarris on Monday also had to juggle discussions on her pick with her official duties. She joined Biden in the White House Situation Room amid intense diplomacy as signs point to an Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel that would risk igniting a full-scale regional war that could drag in the United States. News that several US service members were injured in a suspected rocket attack on an air base in Iraq again underscored the many factors that are beyond the vice president's control that could rock the race in the run-up to November. Multiple US officials told CNN that the US expects Iran to hit back for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran perhaps within a 24-hour time frame -- a period that could coincide with the vice president's plans to name her running mate.\n\nThe Middle East war has already had a significant impact on the campaign. Israel's repeated disregard for Biden's calls to shield civilians in its assault on Hamas in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks has carved splits in the Democratic coalition, especially in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which is home to many Arab Americans.\n\nThe war has also loomed over Harris' search for a running mate since Shapiro, who is Jewish, is being criticized by some on the left for comments condemning the tone of campus protests. While he has been more outspokenly critical about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than Biden has, some progressives have warned against his selection as a running mate.\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss on Monday criticized a campaign from what he described as the \"overly online left\" against Shapiro's possible nomination. \"There's a strong undercurrent of antisemitism to that,\" the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN's Kasie Hunt.\n\nTrump, who has struggled to adapt his campaign to his new Democratic foe, sought to exploit both evolving crises on Monday in a way that pointed to a potentially more effective attack against Harris than his questioning of her racial identify last week. He blasted the stock sell off as a \"Kamala Crash\" on social media and warned World War III was beckoning.\n\nThe ex-president's comments lacked context and were overly alarmist. But perception is often as important as reality in a presidential race. Trump is seeking to tie Harris to what he claims are Biden's failures as he seeks to foster a sense among Americans that the country and the world are fast spinning out of control.\n\nAt the very least, the economy and Middle East instability will increase pressure on Harris to do more to counter Trump's populist economic arguments and to flesh out how she would lead at a time when US global power is more challenged than it's been in decades.\n\nThe choice of a running mate is the first, most critical decision a party nominee makes. They, after all, are choosing a potential commander in chief who they deem fit to serve as president should the worst happen to them.\n\nBut while the pick generates huge public interest, fundraising potential and can bolster a presidential nominee's narrative or compensate for their liabilities, it's been years since a vice presidential selection has been the decisive factor in winning an election.\n\nThe most important tactical consideration for Harris, therefore, may be to ensure her choice does nothing to detract from her successful rollout -- either in action or by the exposure of past deeds. Any mistakes in vetting her choice could offer Trump and his campaign a chance to pick apart a poorly vetted candidacy and regain some traction.\n\nThe vice president has just witnessed an object lesson in the perils of running mate politics. Trump and his team have spent two weeks having to defend his pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, after his past reference to Democratic politicians as \"childless cat ladies\" contributed to the rockiest rollout of any vice presidential pick since Republican Sarah Palin in 2008. The Harris campaign will be seeking a scandal-free rollout and a triumphant swing state tour that keeps Trump off balance for another week and allows her to ride into the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on a political high in two weeks.\n\nTuesday's events in Philadelphia would have been unthinkable less than three weeks ago when Biden was resisting growing Democratic efforts to push him aside after his disastrous June debate performance in Atlanta. At the time, the 2024 race -- which promises sweeping consequences for America's democracy and future path -- was still reeling from the attempt to kill Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania just before he claimed his third-straight GOP nomination.\n\nThe contest for the White House had previously been shaped by Trump's multiple legal woes, but the success of his courtroom delaying tactics and assists from conservative judges have pushed off a reckoning for his most serious alleged offenses - including his attempt to steal the 2020 election that he lost in a bid to remain in power.\n\nStill, Harris' strong start appears to have restored the election to a neck-and-neck race, according to recent surveys. In the latest CNN Poll of Polls, for instance, there was no clear leader nationally with Trump at 49% and Harris at 47%. But the vice president's campaign is so new that it's too early to judge the full impact of her entry into the race, especially without a critical mass of new swing state data.\n\nA successful rollout of her running mate offers the prospect of another few weeks of positive vibes in a transformed race -- if outside events don't intervene.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

While the campaign has cautioned the starting point where she is expected to be alongside her running mate is not an indicator of the choice, a leading candidate since July 21 has been Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Monday morning Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz appeared to be a finalist.\n\nHarris on Friday secured enough of the delegates in the Democratic National Convention's virtual roll call vote to clinch the party nomination. No other candidates ever emerged. That process started Friday and ends Monday. The convention, where a ceremonial roll call will be held, is Aug. 19-22 in Chicago.\n\nHarris ascended to the top of the party ticket when President Joe Biden two weeks ago posted to social media he would not accept the nomination for reelection. Health concerns for the nation's 46th president grew immensely with his performance on June 27 in a debate against Republican former President Donald Trump; two subsequent appearances making addresses from the Oval Office in which he never once in either looked at the camera as he stumbled a bit reading a teleprompter; and few public appearances.\n\nWalz was considered a longshot at the outset of the process while Shapiro was a frontrunner along with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Arizona U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker have generally been at a next level.\n\nVetting information was sought from most if not all of them; the Harris campaign has not publicly announced a list, and varying reports suggest all were asked. Cooper said last week it was not the time for him to be considered and withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nProfessional oddsmakers, in the business of getting equal money on bets for its profits, have seized the moment with prop bets among many others tied to the election. Shapiro is the consensus favorite as of Monday morning. Reports have Walz supported by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nAt BetOnline, Shapiro is minus-275, Walz plus-215, Beshear plus-1600 and Kelly plus-1800.\n\nWhen the odds are a minus, this is the amount needed to wager to make $100. Wagering $100 on a plus bet nets the amount shown; for example, $100 on a plus-500 wins $500. The latter is a longer shot.\n\nAt Oddschecker, Shapiro is minus-188, Walz plus-420, Kelly plus-1800 and Beshear plus-3100.\n\nAt Polymarket, Shapiro is the choice over Walz 66 percent-25 percent, with Kelly 5 percent and Beshear 3 percent. At $markets, it's Shapiro 64.9 percent, Walz 25.6 percent, Buttigieg 9 percent, Kelly 8.3 percent and Beshear 5.1 percent.\n\nPredictIT is similar, with Shapiro 65 cents (betting yes is 65 cents on the dollar), Walz 28 cents, Kelly 10 cents and Beshear 5 cents.\n\n- -

Josh Shapiro, 51, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, sources told CNN, although Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon. Shapiro is a rising Democratic star whose popularity in the commonwealth could be an asset to Harris in perhaps the most vital swing state. Walz is an experienced progressive leader whose profile could help shore up the midwestern blue wall states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, that may represent Harris' best route to the Oval Office.\n\nThe theatrics will offer the vice president a fresh chance to supercharge her candidacy's momentum, which has energized a party that had looked headed for defeat in November and tightened the contest into a 50-50 struggle in a polarized country. Her relative youth, at 59, has inverted the generational contrast with Trump, 78, now that the issue of Biden's age and acuity in a potential second term is moot.\n\nWhile the naming of the Democratic vice presidential pick is the focus of the campaign, new developments Monday -- outside a race that has been on a momentous trajectory since Trump escaped an assassination attempt and Biden pulled out -- hinted at potential new twists to come before November.\n\nEconomic and Middle East drama loom as Harris makes her pick\n\nHarris' final deliberations took place against a backdrop of fast-developing domestic and global events that reflected the complex political environment she must navigate if the novelty of her sudden elevation wears off.\n\nA global stock market plunge, for instance, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,000 points Monday, amid rising unemployment and revived fears of a US recession that could further sour voters on an economy that the White House insists is in great shape but that has nevertheless left millions of people feeling deeply insecure. There is no sign that the US economy faces a looming meltdown on the scale of the 2008 crisis that helped lead to the victory of Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain. The banking system appears strong, inflation has ebbed and the US has bounced back more strongly than other developed nations from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nStill, in a tight election likely to be decided by a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states, any issue can be decisive. Any economic shocks in the weeks to come could prove treacherous for Harris given she's tied to the current administration but also lacks the ability to influence factors like whether the Federal Reserve will begin to make long-awaited interest rate cuts.\n\nHarris on Monday also had to juggle discussions on her pick with her official duties. She joined Biden in the White House Situation Room amid intense diplomacy as signs point to an Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel that would risk igniting a full-scale regional war that could drag in the United States. News that several US service members were injured in a suspected rocket attack on an air base in Iraq again underscored the many factors that are beyond the vice president's control that could rock the race in the run-up to November. Multiple US officials told CNN that the US expects Iran to hit back for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran perhaps within a 24-hour time frame -- a period that could coincide with the vice president's plans to name her running mate.\n\nThe Middle East war has already had a significant impact on the campaign. Israel's repeated disregard for Biden's calls to shield civilians in its assault on Hamas in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks has carved splits in the Democratic coalition, especially in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which is home to many Arab Americans.\n\nThe war has also loomed over Harris' search for a running mate since Shapiro, who is Jewish, is being criticized by some on the left for comments condemning the tone of campus protests. While he has been more outspokenly critical about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than Biden has, some progressives have warned against his selection as a running mate.\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss on Monday criticized a campaign from what he described as the \"overly online left\" against Shapiro's possible nomination. \"There's a strong undercurrent of antisemitism to that,\" the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN's Kasie Hunt.\n\nTrump seeks opening as he struggles to deal with Harris\n\nTrump, who has struggled to adapt his campaign to his new Democratic foe, sought to exploit both evolving crises on Monday in a way that pointed to a potentially more effective attack against Harris than his questioning of her racial identify last week. He blasted the stock sell off as a \"Kamala Crash\" on social media and warned World War III was beckoning.\n\nThe ex-president's comments lacked context and were overly alarmist. But perception is often as important as reality in a presidential race. Trump is seeking to tie Harris to what he claims are Biden's failures as he seeks to foster a sense among Americans that the country and the world are fast spinning out of control.\n\nAt the very least, the economy and Middle East instability will increase pressure on Harris to do more to counter Trump's populist economic arguments and to flesh out how she would lead at a time when US global power is more challenged than it's been in decades.\n\nA critical choice\n\nThe choice of a running mate is the first, most critical decision a party nominee makes. They, after all, are choosing a potential commander in chief who they deem fit to serve as president should the worst happen to them.\n\nBut while the pick generates huge public interest, fundraising potential and can bolster a presidential nominee's narrative or compensate for their liabilities, it's been years since a vice presidential selection has been the decisive factor in winning an election.\n\nThe most important tactical consideration for Harris, therefore, may be to ensure her choice does nothing to detract from her successful rollout -- either in action or by the exposure of past deeds. Any mistakes in vetting her choice could offer Trump and his campaign a chance to pick apart a poorly vetted candidacy and regain some traction.\n\nThe vice president has just witnessed an object lesson in the perils of running mate politics. Trump and his team have spent two weeks having to defend his pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, after his past reference to Democratic politicians as \"childless cat ladies\" contributed to the rockiest rollout of any vice presidential pick since Republican Sarah Palin in 2008. The Harris campaign will be seeking a scandal-free rollout and a triumphant swing state tour that keeps Trump off balance for another week and allows her to ride into the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on a political high in two weeks.\n\nTuesday's events in Philadelphia would have been unthinkable less than three weeks ago when Biden was resisting growing Democratic efforts to push him aside after his disastrous June debate performance in Atlanta. At the time, the 2024 race -- which promises sweeping consequences for America's democracy and future path -- was still reeling from the attempt to kill Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania just before he claimed his third-straight GOP nomination.\n\nThe contest for the White House had previously been shaped by Trump's multiple legal woes, but the success of his courtroom delaying tactics and assists from conservative judges have pushed off a reckoning for his most serious alleged offenses - including his attempt to steal the 2020 election that he lost in a bid to remain in power.\n\nStill, Harris' strong start appears to have restored the election to a neck-and-neck race, according to recent surveys. In the latest CNN Poll of Polls, for instance, there was no clear leader nationally with Trump at 49% and Harris at 47%. But the vice president's campaign is so new that it's too early to judge the full impact of her entry into the race, especially without a critical mass of new swing state data.\n\nA successful rollout of her running mate offers the prospect of another few weeks of positive vibes in a transformed race -- if outside events don't intervene.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

TIM WALZ are higher than the chances of her picking Pennsylvania Gov. JOSH SHAPIRO -- a reversal of the expectations from just a few days ago.\n\nOur focus group of two dozen Democrats included U.S. senators, House lawmakers spanning the ideological spectrum of the party, senior JOE BIDEN administration officials inside and outside the White House, Harris campaign aides (they are as in the dark as everyone else) and plugged-in strategists.\n\nAll but two of these 24 Democrats thought it would be Walz. Some of the Shapiro fans went as far as to start spinning reasons why Shapiro might not want the job anyway. It is a notable 11th-hour shift in expectations towards Walz.\n\nOf course, the Democratic conversation may not mirror what's going on in Harris's inner circle, and it could be exaggerated. \"We could all be in our bubble,\" said a House Democrat who was also hearing the Walz buzz.\n\nIll-informed speculation or not, Walzmentum is what Democrats are obsessed with on the eve of Harris's announcement.\n\nWHAT'S BEHIND THE CHANGE? \"Lots believe it's Walz based on the progressive campaign to end Shapiro,\" said one House lawmaker echoing a common explanation we heard. The theory here is that the pressure from pro-Palestinian groups and labor bloodied up Shapiro enough to give Harris pause, making Walz what a senior administration official argued would be the \"path of least resistance.\"\n\n\"I can see them looking at the explosion of enthusiasm from young people and being spooked out of nominating him if it risks bringing Gaza back into the conversation,\" said a Democratic strategist who knows the Harris team well.\n\nWhatever Harris decides, the veepstakes ended up resembling a familiar intra-party ideological fight. \"We didn't have a primary, so the VP became a primary,\" said the senior administration official. \"The left went after Shapiro, and the left rallied around Walz.\"\n\n'WHAT DOES HE GET HER?' The prospect of picking Walz over Shapiro was seen by some of those we spoke to last night as a puzzling thing to do for a few reasons.\n\n-- More of the Democratic establishment is behind Shapiro, including many current White House aides.\n\n-- More of the strategist class is behind Shapiro -- or at least it's more obvious to them why Shapiro should be the pick. They can cite chapter and verse as to why it might be true that past running mates didn't help carry their state but Shapiro would be different.\n\nHere's one example we heard last night: \"This is a 50-50 race. We were down for seven months, so where we are today feels like we're winning. But we are just back to even, we're not winning. And a point in Pennsylvania is worth a hundred points, because in a 50-50 race, it's everything.\"\n\nAnother Democratic strategist thought the case was self-evident: \"I still think this trends Shapiro unless they are looking at fundamentally different data than what we all have.\"\n\n-- Harris also knows Shapiro better than she knows Walz and familiarity is important to Harris, though others pointed out that Walz's easy-going Midwestern personality might be a better fit for Harris than Shapiro's intensity and ambition.\n\nJudging by some of the head-scratching we encountered yesterday, if Harris chooses Walz, Democratic insiders are going to want a clear explanation for why he beat out Shapiro. The question we heard more than once last night: \"What does he [Walz] get her?\"\n\nIS CHEMISTRY OVERRATED? We have repeatedly heard from current and former Harris aides that chemistry is the key to this decision. As the NYT notes this morning, \"Ms. Harris wants to pick someone with whom she could quickly build a close and loyalty-driven relationship -- something that did not happen immediately with President Biden.\"\n\nThis is the hope of every presidential candidate during this process, to the point that it has become a cliche.\n\nBut it's worth noting that nobody seems to have gotten this one right in the 21st century: The four previous administrations all ended with the president and vice president on bad terms.\n\nAL GORE blamed BILL CLINTON's scandals for harming Gore's 2000 campaign. DICK CHENEY was furious at GEORGE W. BUSH for refusing to pardon SCOOTER LIBBY. MIKE PENCE was extremely displeased with DONALD TRUMP after the president sicced an angry crowd on him, forcing him to flee the Capitol from a violent mob. BARACK OBAMA and Biden split over Obama favoring HILLARY CLINTON in 2016. That wound healed but was gashed open last month when Obama worked to convince Biden to drop his reelection.\n\nOn the one hand, this history might suggest that the chemistry factor is really important. On the other hand, it might suggest it's a fool's errand so you might as well focus on other things.\n\nGood Tuesday morning. Thanks for reading Playbook. Drop us a line: Rachael Bade, Eugene Daniels, Ryan Lizza.\n\nWHAT TO READ WHILE YOU WAIT -- Our own Meridith McGraw's new book, \"Trump In Exile\" ($32), is out today and she shared some more details from her reporting, which takes you inside Mar-a-Lago as Trump's team plotted his comeback.\n\nThe book sheds new light on Trump's unusual business ventures and his legal troubles, his conspiracies about the 2020 election, his 2022 endorsements, 2024 announcement and ultimately his lock on the Republican nomination. Meridith has been covering Trump since he left the White House and this is a must-read if you want to understand how the former president went from being a political outcast in Washington after January 6 to dominating the GOP today.\n\nOne key moment in Trump's political comeback was his team's early -- and brutal -- takedown of Florida Gov. RON DeSANTIS (who, we will note, is now on team Trump and recently fundraised for a pro-Trump PAC, per NYT's Teddy Schleifer).\n\nIt turns out the Trump team's inspiration for the notorious pudding fingers advertisement had its roots in the organizing philosophy of a famous leftist:\n\n\"When discussing their strategy, one Trump adviser referred to SAUL ALINSKY's 'Rules for Radicals,'\" Meridith reports when describing a key meeting in the run-up to the creation of the anti-DeSantis spot. \"Rule number five: Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. 'There is no defense. It is almost impossible to counter attack ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage.'\"\n\nPOLL POSITION -- In a new Siena College Research Institute poll up this morning, Harris leads DONALD TRUMP 53-39 among likely voters in New York, Bill Mahoney writes. \"That 14-point lead is still relatively narrow -- each of the past four Democratic presidential nominees have enjoyed advantages of 18 to 30 points in summertime Siena surveys. But it marks an improvement over [Biden], who had slimmer leads of 8 to 10 points in most of the monthly Siena polls conducted since last fall.\"\n\nDNC COUNTDOWN -- The Democratic National Convention is just two weeks away.

While it's the St. Louis-area matchup between Rep. CORI BUSH (D-Mo.) and WESLEY BELL that will get most of the attention in tonight's primaries, keep an eye on what's happening in eastern Washington. That's where Rep. DAN NEWHOUSE (R-Wash.) is trying to avoid becoming the ninth of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021 to get drummed out of Congress. As Natalie Fertig reports from White Salmon, Newhouse is facing an uphill battle against two Trump-endorsed candidates, JERROD SESSLER and TIFFANY SMILEY, after narrowly surviving in 2022. He may need help from Democrats to advance to the top-two general election and prevail.\n\nFREAKOUT FALLOUT -- Yesterday global stock markets got slammed over worries about the health of the U.S. economy, ratcheting up the drama ahead of the heart of the election.\n\n\"The turnaround in sentiment is stunning,\" Victoria Guida writes. \"Just a few weeks ago, economists and forecasters were upbeat about fading inflation and resilient growth, a combination that could give Harris a potent pitch to voters. But a weakening job market has sparked fears that the honeymoon won't last, even as the Federal Reserve is close to declaring victory against inflation, with plans to start easing off on the economy soon.\"\n\nThe view from Harris world: Despite a bounce-back in market futures overnight, yesterday's news came as an \"unnerving reminder\" for Dems \"that public gloominess over the economy could hurt the campaign,\" Megan Messerly, Adam Cancryn and Elena Schneider write. \"It's a particular issue in battleground states like Arizona and Nevada, where Democrats acknowledge that many voters are struggling under the combined weight of rising inflation and skyrocketing housing costs and are eager to find someone to blame.\"\n\nThe view from Trump world: \"Trump wants voters to believe the economy is on the brink of catastrophe,\" NYT's Jim Tankersley writes, and has \"joined a chorus of negativity that has in some ways worked: Polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans believe the economy is in recession, even though economic statistics suggest it is not.\"\n\nWhat the experts are saying: \"Although there's a chance the turbulence could lead to a self-fulfilling economic slowdown, analysts and economists say it's too soon to panic,\" WaPo's Abha Bhattarai, Rachel Siegel and Jeff Stein write. \"The economy, by most measures, is still in solid shape. Americans are continuing to spend, the service sector is growing, and the stock market remains up for the year, not too far off the all-time highs it set recently.\"\n\nTHE TRUMP EFFECT -- Early yesterday morning, Trump labeled the turmoil in the global financial markets the \"Kamala Crash,\" giving Republicans hope that he might turn his focus to an economic message. It didn't last very long.\n\nIn an appearance on a livestreamer's channel yesterday, the former president was back to re-litigating his controversial appearance in Chicago last week in which he baselessly questioned Harris' racial identity.\n\n\"Republicans on Monday reeled from Trump's undisciplined approach to the opening stages of his new general election matchup with Harris -- following a weekend that saw him praise Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN while smearing Harris as 'low IQ,' and 'dumb' and attacking a popular swing-state GOP governor whose turnout operation he may need in November,\" Adam Wren, Natalie Allison, Olivia Beavers and Lisa Kashinsky write.\n\nQuite the quote: \"Democrats are racing to remake Kamala Harris from real life SELINA MEYER into the female Obama -- and Donald Trump's lack of discipline is letting them,\" said a national Republican strategist who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"Every day Trump swipes at shiny objects -- attacking the popular governor of a swing state, questioning the race of his opponent, or battling cat lady comments by his VP -- is a day he is letting Harris define herself on her own terms.\"\n\nMore top reads:\n\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD\n\nMIDDLE EAST LATEST -- A series of cascading events in the Middle East has ratcheted up tensions in the region as fears over a wider conflict continue.\n\nAttack in Iraq: \"Several U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at a military base in Iraq, U.S. defense officials said Monday, in what has been a recent uptick in strikes on American forces by Iranian-backed militias,\" AP's Lolita Baldor writes. \"The U.S. defense officials said troops at al-Asad air base were still assessing the injuries and damage, and it appeared that as many as seven military troops and civilians were injured.\"\n\nThe view in Israel: \"Israel remains on high alert for a major retaliation promised by its adversaries after senior Hamas and Hezbollah officials were killed last week, with U.S. officials suggesting that the attack could be imminent,\" WaPo's Miriam Berger, Rachel Pannett, Annabelle Timsit and John Hudson report in Jerusalem.\n\nRelated read: \"Why Is Iran Expected to Attack Israel?

Jacobs wrote in a post on X that she worked with editors to ensure she adhered to guidelines and standards. \"At no time did I do anything that was knowingly inconsistent with the administration's embargo or that would put anyone involved at risk,\" Jacobs wrote.

with his folksy mannerisms and viral comments calling Trump and Vance \"weird.\"\n\nHe served in the Army National Guard and was a high school social studies teacher and football coach before he was

policies, including paid family leave, universal school breakfast and lunch, legalization of recreational marijuana use, state codification of abortion rights and gun control measures like universal background checks and red flag laws.\n\nAs a surrogate for Harris these past few weeks, Walz has praised her for reenergizing Democrats and defended her record against Trump's attacks claiming she is \"ultra-liberal.\"\n\n\"He's going to roll it out, mispronounce names, you know, to try and make the case,\" Walz said of Trump attacking Harris during a recent appearance on CNN. \"The fact of the

Tim Walz as running mate", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday selected as her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a moderate Democrat who when serving in Congress demonstrated the ability to work with Republican lawmakers.\n\nThough popular at home, Walz did not have much of a national profile until his recent plainspoken critique of Republican nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance -- that they are \"weird.\" That one word proved surprisingly effective in eviscerating a former president known for name-calling.\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" Walz said in an interview with MSNBC in July. \"They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room.\"\n\nIt was a language pivot, after years of Democrats calling Trump a threat to democracy, and the Harris campaign latched onto it, issuing a statement calling Trump \"old and quite weird.\"\n\nWalz later explained that constantly calling Trump an existential threat \"gives him way too much power.\"\n\nWalz has deep rural roots, which could prove a counterpoint to Vance, whose political ascent began with his bestselling memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" which chronicles his upbringing in Middletown, Ohio.\n\nOften appearing in public in T-shirts and ball caps, Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach, brings an amiable, Midwestern dad sensibility to the ticket.\n\n\"Excitement in the air, feels like the first day of school, and as a football coach, we're back on offense,\" Walz said in a video message on X in support of Harris' campaign. \"Vice President Harris is bringing the energy, making sure she's gonna be there to protect the democracy, and ... bringing back some joy to our politics.\"\n\nWalz, 60, was born in rural Nebraska and went to high school in the tiny town of Butte, where he graduated among a class of 25 students. He told the New York Times that the class included 12 cousins, and \"finding someone to date was kind of a problem.\"\n\nIn 1989, Walz graduated from Chadron State College in Nebraska with a bachelor's degree in social science education.\n\nHe moved to Mankato, Minn., a small city south of Minneapolis, in 1996. He taught social studies at Mankato West High School and helped coach the football team that won the school's first state championship. He and his wife, Gwen, a fellow teacher, have two children.\n\nWalz also spent 24 years in the Army National Guard, having enlisted at 17. He attained the rank of command sergeant major before retiring in 2005.\n\nHe said he first decided to get involved with politics in 2004 after trying to take a group of students to an appearance by then-President George W. Bush in Mankato. They were denied entry, he said, because one of the students sported a John F. Kerry sticker.\n\n\"Having just returned from military duty in Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom I wished to hear directly from the President and my students, regardless of political party, deserved to witness the historical moment of a sitting president coming to our city,\" Walz wrote on Twitter, now known as X. \"Above all, I was struck by how deeply divided our country was becoming that a veteran & a group of high schoolers would be turned away at the door.\"\n\nAngered by the incident, Walz volunteered for the Kerry campaign and, two years later, was elected to Congress to represent southern Minnesota's rural, Republican-leaning 1st District. He won reelection five times.\n\nAs a congressman, he was lauded for his bipartisanship. From 2015 to 2017, more than half the bills he co-sponsored were introduced by legislators who were not Democrats.\n\nThe highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in the U.S. House, he was named the ranking member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs in 2017.\n\nOnce embraced by the National Rifle Assn., which endorsed him and gave him an \"A\" rating, Walz denounced the organization after the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. He began endorsing gun control measures, including an assault weapons ban.\n\nConservatives heavily criticized Walz for his executive actions early in the COVID-19 pandemic, including stay-at-home orders, mask mandates and closures of businesses and schools campuses.\n\nCritics also said he did not do enough to quell the chaos after Minneapolis was overwhelmed by protest and mayhem after the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white police officer. Walz deployed the Minnesota National Guard three days after Floyd's death. Some said he waited too long to act.\n\nDespite the criticism, Walz was reelected in 2022, and recent polls show that most Minnesotans approve of his performance.\n\nAs governor, he has signed laws that codified the right to abortion and reproductive care, guaranteed free school meals to all K-12 students regardless of income, banned so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ minors and vulnerable adults, and allowed immigrants without legal status to get driver's licenses.\n\nAnd like Vance, he has a taste for Diet Mountain Dew.

Walz is facing allegations of compromising national security, which, if substantiated, could severely impact Harris' decision-making process and potentially devastate her campaign.\n\nGovernor Walz, who has been considered a strong contender for the vice-presidential slot, is now under scrutiny for behavior critics claim to disqualify him from a national security standpoint. These concerns center around alleged actions and associations that could undermine his ability to hold a position of such high responsibility.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Walz is expected to be a significant hurdle for Harris as she navigates the complex process of selecting a running mate. Given the high stakes in the upcoming election, any perceived vulnerability in national security could be a substantial liability for the campaign. Harris, already facing intense scrutiny from political opponents and the media, must weigh the potential fallout from choosing a candidate with such contentious baggage.\n\nInsiders familiar with the situation suggest that the allegations against Walz could provide ample fodder for opponents to exploit, potentially derailing Harris' campaign efforts. In a political climate where national security is a paramount concern for voters, any indication of compromise could sway public opinion and shift the dynamics of the race.\n\nThe exact nature of the accusations against Walz remains somewhat murky, with details yet to be fully disclosed. However, sources close to the investigation indicate that the issues involve significant breaches that raise questions about his suitability for a role that demands unimpeachable integrity and security awareness.\n\nThis development places Harris in a precarious position, as she must balance the need for a strong, capable running mate with the imperative to avoid any semblance of controversy that could undermine her platform. The potential implications of selecting Walz extend beyond mere optics; they could influence voter confidence and affect the campaign's overall strategy.\n\nPolitical analysts are already weighing in on the potential impact of this controversy. Some argue that the allegations against Walz could force Harris to reconsider her shortlist of candidates, seeking a safer, less contentious choice. Others suggest that Harris might stand by Walz, provided he can adequately address and dispel the accusations, showcasing a commitment to transparency and resilience.\n\nThe unfolding situation underscores the high-stakes nature of the vice-presidential selection process, where every decision is scrutinized and can have far-reaching consequences. As Harris' team deliberates, the pressure mounts to ensure that the chosen candidate not only complements her vision but also withstands the rigorous examination of their credentials and history.\n\nMore information is expected to surface in the coming days, shedding light on the specifics of the allegations against Walz. The Harris campaign's response to these revelations will be critical in shaping public perception and maintaining momentum in a fiercely competitive political landscape.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/08/03nlxpw9cj_th_1024x0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788903", "eventUri": "eng-9788903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Josh Shapiro, 51, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, sources told CNN, although Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon. Shapiro is a rising Democratic star whose popularity in the commonwealth could be an asset to Harris in perhaps the most vital swing state. Walz is an experienced progressive leader whose profile could help shore up the midwestern blue wall states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, that may represent Harris' best route to the Oval Office.\n\nThe theatrics will offer the vice president a fresh chance to supercharge her candidacy's momentum, which has energized a party that had looked headed for defeat in November and tightened the contest into a 50-50 struggle in a polarized country. Her relative youth, at 59, has inverted the generational contrast with Trump, 78, now that the issue of Biden's age and acuity in a potential second term is moot.\n\nWhile the naming of the Democratic vice presidential pick is the focus of the campaign, new developments Monday -- outside a race that has been on a momentous trajectory since Trump escaped an assassination attempt and Biden pulled out -- hinted at potential new twists to come before November.\n\nEconomic and Middle East drama loom as Harris makes her pick\n\nHarris' final deliberations took place against a backdrop of fast-developing domestic and global events that reflected the complex political environment she must navigate if the novelty of her sudden elevation wears off.\n\nA global stock market plunge, for instance, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,000 points Monday, amid rising unemployment and revived fears of a US recession that could further sour voters on an economy that the White House insists is in great shape but that has nevertheless left millions of people feeling deeply insecure. There is no sign that the US economy faces a looming meltdown on the scale of the 2008 crisis that helped lead to the victory of Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain. The banking system appears strong, inflation has ebbed and the US has bounced back more strongly than other developed nations from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nStill, in a tight election likely to be decided by a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states, any issue can be decisive. Any economic shocks in the weeks to come could prove treacherous for Harris given she's tied to the current administration but also lacks the ability to influence factors like whether the Federal Reserve will begin to make long-awaited interest rate cuts.\n\nHarris on Monday also had to juggle discussions on her pick with her official duties. She joined Biden in the White House Situation Room amid intense diplomacy as signs point to an Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel that would risk igniting a full-scale regional war that could drag in the United States. News that several US service members were injured in a suspected rocket attack on an air base in Iraq again underscored the many factors that are beyond the vice president's control that could rock the race in the run-up to November. Multiple US officials told CNN that the US expects Iran to hit back for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran perhaps within a 24-hour time frame -- a period that could coincide with the vice president's plans to name her running mate.\n\nThe Middle East war has already had a significant impact on the campaign. Israel's repeated disregard for Biden's calls to shield civilians in its assault on Hamas in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks has carved splits in the Democratic coalition, especially in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which is home to many Arab Americans.\n\nThe war has also loomed over Harris' search for a running mate since Shapiro, who is Jewish, is being criticized by some on the left for comments condemning the tone of campus protests. While he has been more outspokenly critical about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than Biden has, some progressives have warned against his selection as a running mate.\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss on Monday criticized a campaign from what he described as the \"overly online left\" against Shapiro's possible nomination. \"There's a strong undercurrent of antisemitism to that,\" the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN's Kasie Hunt.\n\nTrump seeks opening as he struggles to deal with Harris\n\nTrump, who has struggled to adapt his campaign to his new Democratic foe, sought to exploit both evolving crises on Monday in a way that pointed to a potentially more effective attack against Harris than his questioning of her racial identify last week. He blasted the stock sell off as a \"Kamala Crash\" on social media and warned World War III was beckoning.\n\nThe ex-president's comments lacked context and were overly alarmist. But perception is often as important as reality in a presidential race. Trump is seeking to tie Harris to what he claims are Biden's failures as he seeks to foster a sense among Americans that the country and the world are fast spinning out of control.\n\nAt the very least, the economy and Middle East instability will increase pressure on Harris to do more to counter Trump's populist economic arguments and to flesh out how she would lead at a time when US global power is more challenged than it's been in decades.\n\nA critical choice\n\nThe choice of a running mate is the first, most critical decision a party nominee makes. They, after all, are choosing a potential commander in chief who they deem fit to serve as president should the worst happen to them.\n\nBut while the pick generates huge public interest, fundraising potential and can bolster a presidential nominee's narrative or compensate for their liabilities, it's been years since a vice presidential selection has been the decisive factor in winning an election.\n\nThe most important tactical consideration for Harris, therefore, may be to ensure her choice does nothing to detract from her successful rollout -- either in action or by the exposure of past deeds. Any mistakes in vetting her choice could offer Trump and his campaign a chance to pick apart a poorly vetted candidacy and regain some traction.\n\nThe vice president has just witnessed an object lesson in the perils of running mate politics. Trump and his team have spent two weeks having to defend his pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, after his past reference to Democratic politicians as \"childless cat ladies\" contributed to the rockiest rollout of any vice presidential pick since Republican Sarah Palin in 2008. The Harris campaign will be seeking a scandal-free rollout and a triumphant swing state tour that keeps Trump off balance for another week and allows her to ride into the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on a political high in two weeks.\n\nTuesday's events in Philadelphia would have been unthinkable less than three weeks ago when Biden was resisting growing Democratic efforts to push him aside after his disastrous June debate performance in Atlanta. At the time, the 2024 race -- which promises sweeping consequences for America's democracy and future path -- was still reeling from the attempt to kill Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania just before he claimed his third-straight GOP nomination.\n\nThe contest for the White House had previously been shaped by Trump's multiple legal woes, but the success of his courtroom delaying tactics and assists from conservative judges have pushed off a reckoning for his most serious alleged offenses - including his attempt to steal the 2020 election that he lost in a bid to remain in power.\n\nStill, Harris' strong start appears to have restored the election to a neck-and-neck race, according to recent surveys. In the latest CNN Poll of Polls, for instance, there was no clear leader nationally with Trump at 49% and Harris at 47%. But the vice president's campaign is so new that it's too early to judge the full impact of her entry into the race, especially without a critical mass of new swing state data.\n\nA successful rollout of her running mate offers the prospect of another few weeks of positive vibes in a transformed race -- if outside events don't intervene.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Kamala Harris' Potential VP Choice Explained", "body": "Recent reports suggest that Kamala Harris has narrowed down her vice-presidential choices to two candidates: Josh Shapiro and Tim Walz. Speculation about Walz's selection was fueled by a recent post on X (formerly Twitter) by Dan Green, which claimed that multiple black SUVs were seen outside Walz's residence. While neither Harris nor Walz has confirmed or commented on these rumors, the post has certainly heightened public interest and curiosity surrounding Walz's potential nomination.\n\nTim Walz, the 60-year-old governor of Minnesota, has emerged as a prominent candidate for the vice-presidential nomination. Walz is a former member of Congress and current governor since 2019. He is also the chair of the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nBefore entering politics, Walz served in the Army National Guard and worked as a teacher, initially at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, and later in China and Mankato, Minnesota. His political career began with John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign, which he joined after his students faced questioning over Kerry stickers at a rally.\n\nAs governor, Walz has enacted several progressive measures. These includes providing tuition-free meals at state universities, securing abortion rights in state law, and banning conversion therapy. He has also supported gender-affirming healthcare and expanded voting rights for formerly incarcerated residents. However, he has faced criticism from Minnesota Republicans, particularly for his protection of gender-affirming care and his handling of police brutality protests following George Floyd's death.\n\nDespite some controversies, including recent Republican backlash over his comments and actions, Walz has been praised for his vigorous campaign for the vice-presidential spot. Supporters, including former Obama strategist David Axelrod and progressive groups like the Won't PAC Down, have highlighted Walz's strong appeal and practical approach, noting his ability to connect with voters beyond the Midwest.\n\nWalz has recently also enhanced his visibility as a strong advocate for Kamala Harris. His pointed critiques of Trump and J.D. Vance as \"weird\" have gained traction and been embraced by the Harris campaign (via Reuters).", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "disheeta_maheshwari@comingsoon.net", "name": "Disheeta Maheshwari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry_2004_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Governors_Association", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Governors Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pine Ridge Indian Reservation"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pine Ridge Indian Reservation"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankato,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Axelrod_(political_consultant)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Axelrod (political consultant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Josh Shapiro, 51, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, sources told CNN, although Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon. Shapiro is a rising Democratic star whose popularity in the commonwealth could be an asset to Harris in perhaps the most vital swing state. Walz is an experienced progressive leader whose profile could help shore up the midwestern blue wall states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, that may represent Harris' best route to the Oval Office.\n\nThe theatrics will offer the vice president a fresh chance to supercharge her candidacy's momentum, which has energized a party that had looked headed for defeat in November and tightened the contest into a 50-50 struggle in a polarized country. Her relative youth, at 59, has inverted the generational contrast with Trump, 78, now that the issue of Biden's age and acuity in a potential second term is moot.\n\nWhile the naming of the Democratic vice presidential pick is the focus of the campaign, new developments Monday -- outside a race that has been on a momentous trajectory since Trump escaped an assassination attempt and Biden pulled out -- hinted at potential new twists to come before November.\n\nEconomic and Middle East drama loom as Harris makes her pick\n\nHarris' final deliberations took place against a backdrop of fast-developing domestic and global events that reflected the complex political environment she must navigate if the novelty of her sudden elevation wears off.\n\nA global stock market plunge, for instance, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,000 points Monday, amid rising unemployment and revived fears of a US recession that could further sour voters on an economy that the White House insists is in great shape but that has nevertheless left millions of people feeling deeply insecure. There is no sign that the US economy faces a looming meltdown on the scale of the 2008 crisis that helped lead to the victory of Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain. The banking system appears strong, inflation has ebbed and the US has bounced back more strongly than other developed nations from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nStill, in a tight election likely to be decided by a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states, any issue can be decisive. Any economic shocks in the weeks to come could prove treacherous for Harris given she's tied to the current administration but also lacks the ability to influence factors like whether the Federal Reserve will begin to make long-awaited interest rate cuts.\n\nHarris on Monday also had to juggle discussions on her pick with her official duties. She joined Biden in the White House Situation Room amid intense diplomacy as signs point to an Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel that would risk igniting a full-scale regional war that could drag in the United States. News that several US service members were injured in a suspected rocket attack on an air base in Iraq again underscored the many factors that are beyond the vice president's control that could rock the race in the run-up to November. Multiple US officials told CNN that the US expects Iran to hit back for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran perhaps within a 24-hour time frame -- a period that could coincide with the vice president's plans to name her running mate.\n\nThe Middle East war has already had a significant impact on the campaign. Israel's repeated disregard for Biden's calls to shield civilians in its assault on Hamas in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks has carved splits in the Democratic coalition, especially in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which is home to many Arab Americans.\n\nThe war has also loomed over Harris' search for a running mate since Shapiro, who is Jewish, is being criticized by some on the left for comments condemning the tone of campus protests. While he has been more outspokenly critical about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than Biden has, some progressives have warned against his selection as a running mate.\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss on Monday criticized a campaign from what he described as the \"overly online left\" against Shapiro's possible nomination. \"There's a strong undercurrent of antisemitism to that,\" the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN's Kasie Hunt.\n\nTrump seeks opening as he struggles to deal with Harris\n\nTrump, who has struggled to adapt his campaign to his new Democratic foe, sought to exploit both evolving crises on Monday in a way that pointed to a potentially more effective attack against Harris than his questioning of her racial identify last week. He blasted the stock sell off as a \"Kamala Crash\" on social media and warned World War III was beckoning.\n\nThe ex-president's comments lacked context and were overly alarmist. But perception is often as important as reality in a presidential race. Trump is seeking to tie Harris to what he claims are Biden's failures as he seeks to foster a sense among Americans that the country and the world are fast spinning out of control.\n\nAt the very least, the economy and Middle East instability will increase pressure on Harris to do more to counter Trump's populist economic arguments and to flesh out how she would lead at a time when US global power is more challenged than it's been in decades.\n\nA critical choice\n\nThe choice of a running mate is the first, most critical decision a party nominee makes. They, after all, are choosing a potential commander in chief who they deem fit to serve as president should the worst happen to them.\n\nBut while the pick generates huge public interest, fundraising potential and can bolster a presidential nominee's narrative or compensate for their liabilities, it's been years since a vice presidential selection has been the decisive factor in winning an election.\n\nThe most important tactical consideration for Harris, therefore, may be to ensure her choice does nothing to detract from her successful rollout -- either in action or by the exposure of past deeds. Any mistakes in vetting her choice could offer Trump and his campaign a chance to pick apart a poorly vetted candidacy and regain some traction.\n\nThe vice president has just witnessed an object lesson in the perils of running mate politics. Trump and his team have spent two weeks having to defend his pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, after his past reference to Democratic politicians as \"childless cat ladies\" contributed to the rockiest rollout of any vice presidential pick since Republican Sarah Palin in 2008. The Harris campaign will be seeking a scandal-free rollout and a triumphant swing state tour that keeps Trump off balance for another week and allows her to ride into the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on a political high in two weeks.\n\nTuesday's events in Philadelphia would have been unthinkable less than three weeks ago when Biden was resisting growing Democratic efforts to push him aside after his disastrous June debate performance in Atlanta. At the time, the 2024 race -- which promises sweeping consequences for America's democracy and future path -- was still reeling from the attempt to kill Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania just before he claimed his third-straight GOP nomination.\n\nThe contest for the White House had previously been shaped by Trump's multiple legal woes, but the success of his courtroom delaying tactics and assists from conservative judges have pushed off a reckoning for his most serious alleged offenses - including his attempt to steal the 2020 election that he lost in a bid to remain in power.\n\nStill, Harris' strong start appears to have restored the election to a neck-and-neck race, according to recent surveys. In the latest CNN Poll of Polls, for instance, there was no clear leader nationally with Trump at 49% and Harris at 47%. But the vice president's campaign is so new that it's too early to judge the full impact of her entry into the race, especially without a critical mass of new swing state data.\n\nA successful rollout of her running mate offers the prospect of another few weeks of positive vibes in a transformed race -- if outside events don't intervene.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov.

That is weird behaviour. I don't think you call it anything else,\" Mr Walz told CNN.\n\nMr Walz's midwestern charms and his ability to talk about issues with everyday language received lots of attention, not least from Kamala Harris as she whittled down her list of potential running mates.\n\nIt was not long before she and lots of other Democrats were using Mr Walz's adjective to describe Trump and his own running mate JD Vance. In short, \"weird\" went viral.\n\nMr Walz, a former US Army National Guard member and teacher, was not at the top of the list of names being thrown around by the Harris team and pundits for potential running mates.\n\nBut as he appeared more on television to make the case for Democrats ahead of the party's convention later this month in Chicago, people were increasingly struck by his potential appeal to working-class and progressive voters alike.\n\nIn 2006, he was elected to a usually Republican district in Minnesota and was re-elected four times. In 2018, he was elected governor and re-elected in 2022.\n\nAmong his proudest achievements was providing free school meals and expanded paid worker leave.\n\nMinnesota has not voted Republican in a presidential race since 1972, yet the state - traditionally part of the Democratic \"Blue Wall\" - is at the top of those states Trump would love to win in November.\n\nMinnesota also borders Wisconsin and is close to Michigan, two crucial battlegrounds Ms Harris needs to win to gather 270 electoral college votes.\n\nMr Walz, who is married and has two children, has had support across the party, including progressives such as Bernie Sanders, the US senator, and congresswoman Pramila Jayapal.\n\nMr Sanders told Minnesota Public Radio: \"I had the opportunity to talk to your governor a few days ago and I am very impressed by him. I think you have an excellent governor who understands the needs of working families.\"\n\nNancy Pelosi is also said to be \"leaning\" in his direction.\n\nMr Walz, was born in Nebraska and enlisted in the Army National Guard when he was 17. He served for more than two decades, seeing both domestic and overseas deployments. He later worked as a high school social studies teacher and football coach in Mankato, about 80 miles south of Minneapolis.\n\nHeidi Heitkamp, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota, told US media: \"If you're looking for balance on the ticket in terms of life experience, and who's going to bring that life experience to the administration with a whole series of credentials in solving problems for middle class and American families, Tim Walz has a pretty damn good resume.\"\n\nWhen he was interviewed on CNN about having made the short list, Mr Walz said: \"Well, I'm not speaking on anything personal on this.

This morning, we're talking about the vice presidential sweepstakes, one of the most unique face-offs that we've seen in years.\n\nNote: To make this work as accessible as possible, I've lowered the price for a paid subscription back down to Substack's $5 minimum. If you can't afford that right now, please email me and I'll put you on the list for free. Every paid subscription makes it easier for me to comp one while becoming sustainable.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will introduce her running mate at a rally in Philadelphia layer today, and according to reports, it'll be either Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz or Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nThe location of the rally stoked speculation that Shapiro was going to get the nod, and for a while he did look like the favorite. But after several weeks of increasingly negative press and discourse, it's now looking more like Walz will be the pick; at the very least, betting sites have the Minnesota governor on top at the moment, so if my prediction is wrong, at least I won't be the only one.\n\nEither way, I think that Walz would be the right choice for this political moment, both due to his own strengths and Shapiro's very specific weaknesses.\n\nIf the resistance to Shapiro were largely a leftist objection to his stance on Israeli-Palestinian relations, Harris may well have chosen him. But Shapiro has also been dinged for his history of supporting private school vouchers, and that criticism has come from people perceived as more vital to the Democratic coalition, including UAW president Shawn Fain and... me.\n\n(After a tweet I posted about Shapiro's effort to pass a voucher program in Pennsylvania went semi-viral last week, his team reached out to me in hopes of clarifying his position. It was a good conversation, and maybe it'll lead to some kind of policy-focused interview with the governor himself at some point.)\n\nWhile Shapiro has otherwise been a solid governor, his list of major legislative accomplishments has been limited by Republican control of the state Senate. Walz, on the other hand, cruised to re-election in 2022 and helped Democrats finally flip the upper chamber in the Minnesota legislature. He has used that thinnest of trifectas to deliver an astonishing run of progressive legislative victories, including universal daycare.\n\nI don't know what Shapiro's record would have looked like if Democrats had flipped a few more seats in Pennsylvania, but it'd be hard to beat what Walz has accomplished over the past few years.\n\nPolicy and ideology matter in governance, and as Harris's ascension indicates, a vice president's convictions should be considered on their own terms. But the reality is that while it's nice to have a complementary or simpatico running mate, presidential nominees are mostly looking for a partner who can help them win a general election.\n\nI'm not entirely convinced that a VP pick can single-handedly deliver more than a percentage point or two, but small margins matter. And as JD Vance's faceplant is proving, a running mate can absolutely be an anchor around a candidate's neck.\n\nShapiro's electoral proposition is clear: he's the governor of a must-win swing state, where he enjoys a 55% approval rating and a 64%-25% margin among moderate voters. He went to Georgetown Law, speaks with a cadence that reminds some people of Barack Obama, and projects easy intelligence and competence. The man looks like he was born to be a lawyer and if not a politician, then a CEO or top litigator, and I think he will likely be a top presidential contender in the future.\n\nIt'd be easy to write off Walz's popularity in Minnesota as less helpful in the Electoral College given the state's blue tint, but it's the foundation of that appeal that suggests an intangible edge.\n\nA Nebraska native, he spent 24 years serving in the Army National Guard, building a career as a high school geography teacher and football coach in between deployments. Walz earned his masters' degree at Minnesota State University, Mankato, and after serving as a volunteer on the John Kerry campaign, decided to run for Congress. He spent ten years representing a rural district before returning home to run for governor, a job that comes with perks like private meetings with little piglets at the State Fair.\n\nIn a town filled with ambitious camera hogs, Walz kept a relatively low profile in DC, driven by service more than ambition. Unafraid of spoiling a legacy or sabotaging this accidental second career, Walz is content to shoot from the hip -- he's playing with house money at this point -- and can hardly contain the glee he feels when roasting the elite on cable news.\n\nWalz doesn't rage against the machine -- he hasn't even endorsed Medicare for All -- yet he radiates a kind of populism that can't be recreated through policy platforms. Putting aside that string of successful cable news appearances during this unique audition stage, Walz perhaps best known for being mobbed by a crowd of excited kids when he signed a law guaranteeing free school lunch for every student in Minnesota.\n\nLooking more like a clean-cut Santa Claus than state executive, Walz delivered one of the few truly feel-good political moments of the past few years, displaying the kind of middle class authenticity that Democratic leaders so often lack.\n\nFor all of Shapiro's political talents, he does not represent a break from the well-educated, center-liberal elite that the party has been serving up since the Clinton era. Unfortunately for him, Kamala Harris, as the former district attorney of San Francisco, also falls into that category. As economic inequality has spread and deepened, resentment at this class of elite leaders, on both sides of the aisle, has continued to grow into an increasingly cohesive moment.\n\nWe remain at a precarious moment, still riven by broader resentments that have boiled up to the surface in this country and realigned our politics.\n\nAmericans are wealthier and healthier than they were when the Reagan realignment emerged from the malaise of the '70s, but there is also a more pervasive feeling of paranoia, driven by tech and media and deep income inequality. The political discourse emanating from Washington is often alienating to people, even when in service of good policy.\n\nI don't believe in catering to reactionaries, but I do think that there is a growing class resentment in this country that has nothing to do with political party and doesn't require playing to cynical or base instincts to address. There's no single type of leader that can transcend it -- Bernie Sanders represents one approach, speaking to not only the economic despair that people feel but also the anger and alienation that comes with it, but there are other options as well.\n\nWalz's geniality, solidly working-middle class interests and tendencies, and enthusiastic empathy, and progressive instincts are unique to this election -- JD Vance can discuss his roots, but he clearly resents the people from his past and has alllegiance to the elite -- and make for the kind of candidate that Democrats have rarely embraced. He isn't the coastal Ivy League elite, but instead the Midwest state school grad who got the advanced degree a bit later in life.\n\nKamala Harris has her own gifts and has clearly driven a resurgence of excitement among many voters. She represents the nation's aspirational side, while Walz offers something more familial.\n\nProgress Report has raised over $7 million dollars for progressive candidates and causes, breaks national stories about corrupt politicians, and delivers incisive analysis, and goes deep into the grassroots.\n\nNone of the money we've raised for candidates and causes goes to producing this newsletter or all of the related projects we put out.

Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nWalz was the subject of a flurry of media attention over the last week, including glowing coverage in The Washington Post and The New York Times on Friday, as the Democrats ran an accelerated search for their vice presidential candidate.\n\nWhile there hasn't been an organized progressive effort to push for Walz, he's regarded as the most friendly to left and working-class causes of the politicians known to be in the running, all of whom are white men. Progressives have expressed concerns over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who's seen by many as the most likely choice.\n\n\"I want somebody who's really strongly pro-labor and understands labor, because this is a big part of the working-class agenda and making sure that we win working-class votes,\" Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in explaining why she favored Walz, The Hill reported Friday.\n\nWalz's appeal, buoyed by the sense that he's a straight-talking everyman, goes well beyond progressive circles. Born and raised in Nebraska, he served in the National Guard and worked as a high school teacher and coach. He served six terms as a Democrat in U.S. Congress, representing a rural area of Minnesota that borders Iowa. In 2016, he won reelection in a district that 2024 Republican nominee Donald Trump won handily.\n\nIn 2018, Walz successfully ran for governor, and was reelected in 2022 -- this time with Democrats in the majority in both houses of the state Legislature. (The state party is called the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.) They quickly turned the state into what NBC Newscalled \"a laboratory in pushing progressive policy.\"\n\nUnder Walz's leadership, Minnesota became the fourth state in the country to provide free school lunches for all students. The state also set up a paid family and medical leave program and a tax credit for low-income Minnesotans. Walz also signed into law the strictest rules in the country on \"forever chemicals\" that endanger public health.\n\nWalz and his Democratic allies banned spending on state and municipal elections by firms that were 5% or more foreign-owned -- nearly every S&P 500 firm -- and thereby reduced the pernicious effects of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling on the state's elections. They also established trans rights, secured fundamental abortion rights, and made it possible for undocumented people to get driver's licenses.\n\nDavid M. Perry, a Minnesota-based journalist and historian, said in an MSNBCopinion piece this week that he was initially skeptical of Walz, figuring him to be a conservative Democrat who wouldn't push an ambitious agenda, but had changed his mind -- \"entirely Walz-pilled,\" as he put it. He applauded Walz for the many state-level legislative accomplishments, and cited only \"questionable decisions\" during the 2020 George Floyd uprisings in the governor's negative column.\n\nShawn Fain, president of the United Automobile Workers union, on Thursday toldThe Detroit News that he supported either Walz or Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear to be the Democratic vice presidential nominee, citing their strong pro-labor records. Some groups have called for Fain himself to be the vice presidential nominee.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramila_Jayapal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pramila Jayapal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Progressive_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Progressive Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Democrat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Democrat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizens United v.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Saturday for a rally ahead of the state's Aug. 13 congressional primary elections. A day earlier, he spoke highly of the governor, who is reported to be on Harris's vice presidential short list, in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio.\n\n\"I am very impressed by\" Walz, Sanders said. \"I think you have an excellent governor who understands the needs of working families, so I hope very much that the vice president selects a running mate who will speak up and take on powerful corporate interests, and I think Tim Walz is somebody who could do that.\"\n\nThe senator and two-time Democratic presidential candidate was asked what he would like to see in Harris's running mate, and he expanded on his plea to help working-class families.\n\n\"At a time when 60% of our people live paycheck to paycheck, there's a lot of pain out there,\" Sanders said. \"Working people are struggling, and they're seeing massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and what they want is political leadership in Washington, and all over the country, to start paying attention to their needs.\"\n\nWalz is among the likes of Gov.

Tim Walz speaks during a news conference for the Biden-Harris campaign on July 17, 2024, in Milwaukee.\n\nAs of two weeks ago, the only more unlikely political campaign in America than Harris for President was Walz for Vice President. But now that's a reality. Six-term backbenchers in the House and governors from Upper Midwest states far from the Acela corridor don't often make this kind of rapid dash to the center of American politics. How did Tim Walz do it?\n\nExpand\n\nI'm sure a lot of people would attribute it to one word: \"weird,\" which has become a Walz catchphrase. But while single-handedly turning around Democratic messaging overnight is noteworthy -- and a refreshing return to Democrats talking like human beings and not people reciting a dissertation -- I don't think that's what triggered the decision. Being good on TV is something Walz can do as a surrogate. And in a copycat business, any advantage from novel messaging is likely already gone; other VP candidates could pick that line of argument up.\n\nWalz brings other attributes to the ticket. Yes, he's a down-to-earth speaker who can connect with Midwestern voters, a crucial need in two battleground states, Wisconsin and Michigan. He was also a frontline Democrat in the House for 12 years, who in 2016 won a district that Trump took by 15 points. The frontliner mentality to put yourself in the position to win elections adapts well to a national campaign. And in Walz's case, that didn't mean just voting conservatively; he knows how to message good and popular ideas for all audiences.\n\nMore from David Dayen\n\nHaving ties to longtime House members will help with governing; Walz had more congressional experience than any of the other VP candidates under consideration. His military record -- he was a noncommissioned officer in the Army National Guard, and the ranking member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, also making him the highest-ranking enlisted man ever to serve in Congress -- could be an asset as well.\n\nBut it's Walz's experience as governor of Minnesota that would be most helpful to Harris as a partner. In a best-case scenario, a President Harris will step into the same situation that Walz did in his second term in Minnesota, with a thin legislative advantage and a public desire for real advances. Walz's improbable success in governing with a one-seat majority in the state Senate, and not much more in the state House, may have been an important factor in his favor.\n\nPlus, the details of what Walz and the Democratic legislature in Minnesota got done look a lot like what Harris appears to want to get done in her first two years: focusing on child development and family care. Walz signed legislation giving paid sick leave for nearly all workers, as well as a paid family and medical leave law, with up to 12 weeks in benefits and a progressive replacement rate, where poorer Minnesotans get a higher percentage of their income while on leave. His 2023 budget included a $1.5 billion expansion of the child tax credit worth up to $3,000 per family. His 2024 education law expanded public funding for pre-kindergarten to 12,360 seats, and funded increases to the supply of child care. Long-term care and nursing home investments, Head Start grants, and \"early learning scholarships\" for preschool have also been part of Walz's budgets.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has real possibilities, with a small-town background and a history of working on rural, agricultural, and veterans issues.\n\nThese are all state-level versions of the key elements of the Build Back Better agenda that were left behind in 2022. While they are not perfect -- the work history requirement of $3,500 in income is suboptimal, because mothers without work history need money even more -- in other areas Walz recognized and advocated aggressively for universality, like with the free school breakfast and lunch program. \"This just makes sense,\" Walz said at the bill-signing ceremony at a local school, citing the improvement over the previous system, where families had to attest to income and sign up for a reimbursement program to get free meals. \"This is the assurance that no one falls through the cracks because a busy parent didn't fill out a form.\"\n\nThat recognition is critical to more effective government, to taking away the \"time tax\" that often comes with means-tested programs. And it will be critical to deliberations over the signature legislation of a potential Harris presidency. The messaging helps too; the \"happy warrior\" ebullience of Walz's successes in Minnesota harks back to another of the state's vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey.\n\nWalz has achieved some other goals in Minnesota that are also at the forefront of the national conversation, like a ban on junk fees and required disclosure of all-in pricing, including a \"Taylor Swift\" bill that applies all-in pricing to event ticketing. He has leveraged public dollars for the benefit of workers, like with a law using federal broadband money that prioritizes grants to companies that pay prevailing wages and offer training and health insurance. He even got a permitting reform bill through Minnesota that will accelerate clean-energy projects.\n\nI take this stuff more seriously than a couple of weeks of good messaging that has made a lot of national progressives swoon. The vice presidency is not necessarily a governing role; the impact changes from president to president. But as someone with congressional ties (and the support of many House Democrats) and the experience of dealing with the very issues before the nation, Walz could be a real asset there.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has real possibilities as well, with a small-town background and a history of working on rural, agricultural, and veterans issues. Democrats don't have to win rural America to win the presidency, but limiting losses there makes winning overall much more possible. And to go back to weird, as Ezra Klein correctly says, it was a thunderbolt of a messaging revelation to just express the feeling people have had in their heads for so long. It hits a mindset of asking why Trump Republicans are so obsessed with identity and private personal issues. It's going to be great to get him on a debate stage to articulate more deeply this vision of how Republicans sold out rural America, and went crazy over other issues designed to divide people.\n\nThere are some reservations to be stated here. Walz's interventions at the request of Uber and Lyft to weaken pay standards and at the request of the Mayo Clinic to get an exemption to nurse staffing requirements are not great. And his dismissal of warnings about state pension funds should spur some more investigation. But there is no perfect candidate, and Walz checks a lot of boxes.\n\nA few days into the Harris campaign, the Prospect wrote about Walz's potential on the ticket.

Now, my mission is serving Arizonans.\"\n\nGovernor Shapiro was also swept up in chaos as a leaked video from last week appeared to show him as Harris' official running mate.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker posted the surprising message, however it was unclear if the video was an accidental revealed or an encouragement to Harris.\n\n\"I can't think of a better partner than our Governor Josh Shapiro,\" Parker said in the video, but the post's caption had sparked more interest.\n\n\"Proud to be standing with so many leaders for @kamalaharris for President and @joshshapiropa for VP!\" the caption said.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill feared the party's future was in jeopardy with Biden's approval rating tanking after the debate.\n\nBiden's withdrawal came after top Dems and more than 50 national security officials urged him to drop out.\n\nIn the weeks since the June 27 presidential debate, reports began to surface that Democratic leaders were holding closed-door meetings with the 81-year-old president and, at times, without him.\n\nRattled Democratic leaders privately told Biden on several occasions that he needed to step aside and let another candidate take over to challenge the Republican Party, according to The New York Times.\n\nThese meetings reportedly included heavyweight Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "israel_salas_rodriguez@the-sun.com", "name": "Israel

What the sigma?\n\nWalz gave the nascent Harris campaign the new attack line in a late July interview: \"These are weird people on the other side: They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\" referring to book bans and women's reproductive consultations with doctors.\n\nWalz has also attacked the claims by Trump and Vance of having middle class credentials. \"They keep talking about the middle class. A robber baron real estate guy and a venture capitalist trying to tell us they understand who we are? They don't know who we are,\" Walz said in an MSNBC interview.\n\nThat approach has struck a chord with the young voters Harris needs to reengage. David Hogg, the co-founder of the gun safety group March for Our Lives, described him as a \"great communicator\".\n\nWalz is \"somewhat of a unicorn\", said Ryan Dawkins, a political science professor at Minnesota's Carleton College - a man born in a small town in rural Nebraska capable of conveying Harris' message to core Democratic voters, and those that the party has failed to reach in recent years.\n\nDawkins praised his ability to connect with rural voters. It is a group the Biden administration has tried to reach with infrastructure spending and other pragmatic policies, but with little show of messaging success so far.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Trump won 59 per cent of rural voters; in 2020 that number rose to 65 per cent even though Trump lost the election, according to Pew Research.\n\nIn the 2022 governor's race, Walz won with 52.27 per cent to his Republican opponent's 44.61 per cent, although swaths of rural Minnesota voted for the opponent.\n\nWhile Walz has supported Democratic Party orthodoxy on issues ranging from legalised abortion and same-sex marriage to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, he also racked up a centrist voting record during his congressional career.\n\nHe was a staunch defender of government support for farmers and military veterans, as well as gun-owner rights that won praise from the National Rifle Association, according to The Almanac of American Politics.\n\nHe subsequently registered a failing grade with the NRA after supporting gun-control measures during his first campaign for governor.\n\nWalz's shift from a centrist representing a single rural district in Congress to a more progressive politician as governor may have been in response to the demands of voters in major cities like Minneapolis-St Paul. But it leaves him open to Republican attacks, Dawkins said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"He runs the risk of reinforcing some of the worst fears people have of Kamala Harris being a San Francisco liberal,\" Dawkins said.\n\nWalz has a ready counter-attack.\n\n\"What a monster. Kids are eating and having full bellies, so they can go learn and women are making their own healthcare decisions,\" Walz said in a July CNN interview. \"So if that's where they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label.\"\n\nAs the state's top executive, Walz mandated the use of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic and signed a law making marital rape illegal. He presided over several years of budget surpluses in Minnesota on the road to his 2022 reelection.\n\nDuring that campaign, Walz touted the backing of several influential labor unions, including the state AFL-CIO, firefighters, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), teachers and others.\n\nHis tenure was marked by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murder. Walz assigned the state's attorney general to lead the prosecution in the case, saying people \"don't believe justice can be served\".", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news",

Prior to that, he served in the National Guard after enlisting in 1981 at age 17. He eventually achieved the rank of command sergeant major and became the highest-ranking retired enlisted soldier to be elected to Congress.\n\nHarris and her running mate are set to make their first public appearance together in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The campaign is hoping that the running mate choice will keep key swing areas in play and bring them back toward the Democrats after months of them trending toward former president Donald Trump, Harris's opponent in November.\n\nThere are less than 100 days until the election, and current polling has the race in a dead heat.

He may not have the same profile as other vice presidential hopefuls, but he is well-placed with a proven appeal to rural, white voters and has championed popular progressive policies.\n\nA former teacher and member of the US Army National Guard, Tim Walz has gone viral for attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance as \"weird\" - an insult the Harris campaign has embraced.\n\nBut could they embrace the governor of Minnesota entirely and put him on the presidential ticket?\n\nMr Walz may not have the same profile as other vice presidential hopefuls, but he is well-placed with a proven appeal to rural, white voters. He has championed progressive policies, including free school meals and expanded paid worker leave.\n\nHe also signed into law the so-called Taylor Swift bill, prompted by the frustration a legislator felt at not being able to buy tickets to Swift's 2023 concert in Minneapolis. The law requires ticket sellers to disclose all fees upfront and prohibits resellers from selling more than one copy of a ticket for live events held in Minnesota.\n\nAnd while Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, it is close to Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial battlegrounds. In 2020, Minnesota voted for Biden/Harris with a fairly comfortable margin, but the president's win in Wisconsin was by a margin of just 0.63%.\n\nRead more:\n\nMeet Josh Shapiro - the other VP pick contender\n\nThe 60-year-old Mr Walz was born and raised in small-town Nebraska. He is now Ivy League educated but graduated from state schools in Minnesota and Nebraska.\n\nHe became a teacher, first in China, then Nebraska and finally in Minnesota, where he taught geography and coached the high school football team. He also served in the Army National Guard for 24 years. It is this down-to-earth homespun style that has helped him connect with ordinary Americans.\n\nHeidi Heitkamp, the former senator, described him as \"someone with a lived experience that is so comparable to so many of the people in rural America\".\n\nMr Walz was an early supporter of LGBT rights, being the faculty advisor for his school's first gay-straight alliance in 1999, long before Democrats openly supported gay rights.\n\nHe first ran for office in 2006 in a Republican-leaning congressional district, dispatching the incumbent in an upset and keeping the district for ten years. He ran for governor in 2018 and won, defending the seat again successfully in 2022.\n\nMr Walz co-chairs the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention and had maintained strong support for President Biden despite his shaky debate performance in June.\n\nRead more:\n\nHarris officially declared Democratic nominee\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr abandoned dead bear in Central Park\n\nMr Walz has been described as having the \"most progressive record\" of any of Ms Harris's potential running mate picks.\n\nHis accomplishments include ensuring tuition-free meals at participating state universities, enshrining abortion rights into state law, banning conversion therapy and providing protections for gender-affirming healthcare.\n\nWhen questioned about this on TV, he replied: \"What a monster!

Tim Walz named as Kamala Harris' VP pick", "body": "Walz, the governor of swing-state Minnesota, has become a powerful figure in the party thanks to his great success in pushing a variety of democratic initiatives, including expanding abortion rights, legalizing marijuana and gun reform.\n\nThe 60-year-old's success in Minnesota has been viewed by Democratic operatives as an example of how Harris' campaign could model her message on crucial issues in the 2024 election.\n\nIn 2022, Walz defied a \"red wave\" and won reelection in a heated race that also gave Minnesota Democrats control over both chambers for the first time in eight years.\n\n\"This isn't about jamming down Democratic priorities. These are proven things that improve people's lives,\" Gov. Walz said in an interview according to NBC News, adding that democratic policy goals so far \"are about not allowing our people to be demonized\" because of \"Republicans wanting to go to war on social issues.\"\n\nWalz also oversaw the 2020 George Floyd protests, where he mobilized the National Guard to control protests and later filed civil rights charges against the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\n\"The investigation will review MPD's policies, procedures and practices over the last 10 years to determine if the department has utilized systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color,\" Walz said in a statement.\n\nAmong his most recent accomplishments, in 2023 Walz spearheaded a bill that gave free lunch and breakfast to all Minnesota students, regardless of income requirements set by a federal program. He also signed a bill allowing driver's licenses for all, regardless of immigration status.\n\n\"If there's one thing I hope folks across this country recognize and take away from what we're doing here in Minnesota, is it's amazing what you can accomplish when you stop complaining about corporations going 'woke' and start giving a damn about real people and real lives,\" Walz said.\n\nBefore becoming governor, Walz was a high school teacher who later ran for office and served in the House of Representatives from 2007 to 2019. He then held the highest position for a Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\nWalz also served for more than two decades in the Army National Guard, where he reached the Command Sergeant Major rank and was awarded the Army Commendation and Achievement medals.\n\nSince 1995, Walz has been married to Gwen Whipple, who he met while they were teachers. They have two children together, Hope and Gus.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalization_of_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wave elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_School_Lunch_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National School Lunch Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/08/GettyImages-2161810267.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C37px%2C1024px%2C576px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788903", "eventUri": "eng-9788903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

I worked in two of Jon Tester's campaigns...and there's one vice presidential candidate more than any of the others who will help Jon Tester get reelected to his very essential Senate seat. That candidate is Tim Walz -- because Walz speaks the language of resonance and respect for small town folks everywhere. He also understands their immense frustration and their profoundly appropriate need to be as acknowledged, supported and respected as fully as every other group of Americans.\n\nAs I think of the senatorial campaigns that are being contested, it is certain that Josh Shapiro can, and will help in Pennsylvania. It is not clear that he would help in any other states. However, for different reasons, Tim Walz will probably help in all of those Senate races...and in every other state in America. Oh, and GuavaBoy has the best one-liner yet!\n\nIn Arizona Walz certainly will help with the senior vote, the Native American Vote (and the guy vote). In Ohio he has a special appeal to all those steel workers in the southeast corner of the state. in Nevada his appeal to union workers and retirees could be incredibly helpful, and everywhere Walz will engage teachers and coaches (and people who had great teachers and coaches) and will help with voters trying to find an emotional reason to vote for a Democratic ticket.\n\nHe's also incredibly popular with Gen Z, as my post yesterday pointed out...\"I'm obsessed with Tim Walz.\" Parkland's David Hogg on Kamala's VP Selection. Here's a great comment from that post (link). That, plus Biden thinks Tim Walz is a \"blast.\" AND Bernie Sanders just came out with an endorsement for Tim Walz. (Update) One of the comments in this thread said we only need seven states -- and that could not be further from the truth. So let me list the reasons I can think of for why we need a 50-state outreach...and DKos readers probably have a bunch more...\n\nhttps://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/8/4/2260557/-Shapiro-Helps-in-at-Least-1-State-Walz-Helps-in-50", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Kos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Kos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hogg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Hogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788903", "eventUri": "eng-9788903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

JD Vance, R-Ohio.\n\nGwen Walz was born in Glencoe, Minnesota, and grew up in the western part of the state, according to the official governor's website.\n\nAlongside her three sisters, Gwen was raised by her parents, Val and Linn, who were educators and small business owners. She has received degrees from Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter and Minnesota State University in Mankato. Gwen began her English teaching career in western Nebraska, where she met Tim Walz and married in 1994.\n\nThe Walz's have two children together: Hope and Gus.

Tim Walz, center, followed by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, walks out of the White House to talk with reporters after a meeting with President Joe Biden, July 3, 2024.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, choosing a popular Midwestern governor who brings an authentic connection with rural white voters. The choice, reported by CNN and The Associated Press early Tuesday, citing campaign sources familiar with the decision.\n\nMr. Walz is an Army veteran who grew up in Nebraska and moved to Mankato, in southern Minnesota, to teach high school geography and coach football. His teams won two state championships. He was elected to Congress in 2006, winning a populist competitive district.\n\nMr. Walz was a relatively centrist congressman during his time in the House. He supported the Keystone XL oil pipeline and was once a darling of the National Rifle Association in his early career. But he has shifted to support more restrictions, like an assault weapons ban.\n\nHe's won tough House races in a rural district that leans Republican and two hard-fought gubernatorial elections in the liberal-leaning but competitive state.\n\nHe worked across the aisle with Republicans who controlled the legislature in his first term to secure more funding to fight opioid addiction and cut middle-class taxes. And in the wake of George Floyd's murder by a police officer in Minneapolis, he helped negotiate a bipartisan law putting new restrictions on police use of force in the state.\n\nThe protests and riots that broke out in Minneapolis after Mr. Floyd's death are a vulnerability for him, however: Mr. Walz later admitted that the state's initial response was an \"abject failure.\"\n\nHe also faces criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. A local nonprofit siphoned off a quarter-billion dollars in federal funds meant to feed children during the pandemic, the largest pandemic fraud case in the nation; a jury found five people guilty of fraud, bribery, and money laundering, and dozens of others face charges.\n\nA recent legislative audit found that his administration's Department of Education failed to conduct proper oversight to prevent what the nation's largest pandemic fraud case.\n\nHe began the rapid veepstakes race as a little-known governor, but quickly gained support from progressives, many of whom wanted to find another Rust Belt candidate to block the more centrist Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro from the ticket. Mr. Walz has earned plaudits from the left for his successful push in recent years for legislation to protect abortion access, create paid family leave, provide free school meals to all Minnesota students, legalize recreational marijuana, tighten background checks on gun sales, and force public utility companies to use green energy. And he has close ties with organized labor.\n\nHe also brings to the table the folksy, plainspoken vibe of a Midwestern former schoolteacher, which could help win over voters skeptical of a San Francisco progressive like Ms. Harris.\n\nHis description of former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance as \"weird\" in recent interviews quickly caught on with Ms. Harris and other Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_science_monitor@csmonitor.com", "name": "Christian Science

Tim Walz (D) as her running mate today, CNN reports.\n\nFour sources with the campaign told CNN that she has decided to name Walz as her running mate. The sources said that Harris will make a call with Walz, which will be the official announcement sent to supporters later today. He will fly to Philadelphia today to appear with Harris at their first joint rally.\n\n\"If it's him, we're stoked. We like him,\" one of the sources said, highlighting that Harris has grown comfortable with Walz during the selection process because of his \"happy-go-lucky\" presence.\n\nStay ahead of the 2024 Election with our newsletter that covers candidates, issues, and perspectives that matter.\n\nWalz has nearly two decades of governing experience, including serving in the U.S. House for 12 years. He was also a public school teacher for 20 years and served in the military for 24 years. These experiences have added to his folksy charm as someone who can regularly conveys political concepts by their affect on everyday people.\n\nAs a 35-year-old social studies teacher at Mankato West High School in 1999, Walz advised the school's first gay-straight alliance (GSA). He ran his first House campaign in 2006 on a platform supporting same-sex marriage and has supported the Respect for Marriage Act, a law that ensures federal and state recognition of same-sex marriages.\n\nIn 2009, he made a House floor speech supporting the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" the military's ban on out gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members. That same year, he also helped facilitate the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a 2009 federal law that offers enhanced funding for and prosecution against hate crimes motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias.\n\nWalz opposes bans on trans athletes in school sports teams. In April 2023, he signed a statewide law protecting people seeking gender-affirming care in his state from out-of-state investigations and prosecutions by transphobic Republicans. He also signed a March 2023 executive order directing the Minnesota Department of Health to prepare a report summarizing scientific studies about the safety and effectiveness of gender-affirming health care. The order also directed statewide government offices to ensure that medical insurers have clear policies on their coverage for gender-affirming care.\n\nLast May, Walz signed a bill outlawing the use of anti-LGBTQ+ \"panic defenses\" sometimes used by assailants in court to justify violence against queer victims. That same month, he also signed legislation that stops libraries in the state from removing books, including ones with LGBTQ+ themes. In April 2023, Walz signed a statewide bill banning so-called conversion therapy, the widely discredited and disavowed practice of attempting to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nIn addition to his progressive credentials on LGBTQ+ rights, Walz has passed progressive reforms during his six years as governor, including laws ensuring reproductive healthcare access, common sense gun reforms, the legalization of recreational cannabis, and the strengthening of voting and workers rights. He has also historically increased his state's funding for education, infrastructure, affordable housing, and renewable energy.", "source": {"uri": "lgbtqnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Harris and her running mate plan to rally in a variety of venues, from large arenas to college campuses. The trip will also allow them to see voters in smaller settings like union halls, family owned restaurants and campaign field offices.\n\nAt a fundraiser in Minneapolis on Monday night, Walz said Trump has stolen America's joy and was limiting freedoms.\n\n\"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird,\" Walz said of the label he has applied to the GOP ticket in recent days. \"It was an observation.\"\n\nIt's a characterization that has since taken off in Democratic circles.\n\nIf Harris opts for Shapiro, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs, Tuesday's event with her there would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nConsideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza. But Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania -- one of the Democrats' crucial \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Wisconsin -- that Harris will be looking to cement ahead of November.\n\nOn a \"Progressives for Harris\" organizing call Monday night that organizers said drew tens of thousands of participants, speakers repeatedly derided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an \"authoritarian\" who was needlessly targeting and killing civilians in Gaza.\n\nSome delegates to the Democratic National Convention who supported \" uncommitted \" rather than Biden because of his administration's backing of Israel, also suggested that they weren't yet ready to support Harris until they knew more about her policies, including if she'll work more diligently toward a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting.\n\nBut those on the call refrained from criticizing Harris' potential running mates, instead focusing on Trump.\n\n\"Trump and JD Vance are promising more tax cuts for the mega-millionaires and billionaires,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"This election is our chance to tax the rich and make the wealthy pay their fair share.\"\n\nAs for Kelly, some congressional Democrats have promoted the former astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles (600 kilometers) of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies are too relaxed -- though some union leaders have suggested the senator isn't as

Direct to your inbox. Sign up for the Morning Report newsletter\n\nVice President Harris today has an announcement to make about her running mate hours after Democratic Party delegates completed a virtual roll call and officially made her the nominee.\n\nShe will unveil her choice following an accelerated 16-day candidacy after President Biden withdrew his bid for a second term and endorsed her.\n\nHarris and her new election partner plan tonight to showcase the Democratic ticket on a Temple University stage in Philadelphia and are scheduled to barnstorm through at least six swing states this week to try to build party unity and mobilize voters to defeat former President Trump and running mate Sen. JD Vance (Ohio). The four-day Democratic National Convention begins Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nHarris amassed an impressive war chest in the course of weeks, inspired organic organizations of supporters rooting for the first female president and tapped into a tight circle of advisers who know a lot about winning the White House, including former President Obama.\n\nThe VP field reportedly narrowed to two likely choices as of Monday: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Both bring legislative and leadership experience in important states for the Democrats in November.\n\nShapiro, 51, is the popular governor of the biggest swing state, an effective communicator and a fast-rising star within the Democratic Party. He has a reputation as a moderate with crossover appeal. Progressives have increasingly targeted Shapiro, who is Jewish, in recent days over his stances on Israel and handling of pro-Paletsinian protests, write The Hill's Amie Parnes and Julia Manchester. Some Jewish Democrats on Capitol Hill say Shapiro has been unfairly maligned because he's the only Jewish politician on Harris's known candidate list, write The Hill's Mike Lillis and Mychael Schnell.\n\n\"Josh's position on Israel is almost identical to everybody else, but he's being held to a different standard. So you have to ask yourself why,\" said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.).\n\nMeanwhile, Walz, 60, spoke before an energetic crowd Monday at a fundraiser in downtown Minneapolis. He didn't drop any hints about Harris's VP suspense, but the governor touted an upbeat focus on the future that he hopes to spread on the campaign trail in defense of the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"We've got to run this campaign against the serious threat that's there, but we have to do it every single day with a sense of joy,\" Walz said.\n\nWalz, who enjoys a warm relationship with Biden, governs a once-solidly blue state that has leaned purple in the Trump years. His rhetorical style connects well with votes -- Walz's characterization of Trump and other Republicans as \"weird\" has caught fire within the Democratic Party. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain praised him this weekend as a stalwart representative of the working class voters.\n\nThe Hill's Niall Stanage in The Memo: The final odds in the Harris veepstakes.\n\nIt wasn't quite Black Monday, but it was a bleak start to the week among investors who drove financial markets to the biggest single-day swan dive in nearly two years. A rout that began in Asia continued in Europe Monday, and U.S. stocks fell sharply. Some investors said the sell-off was an overdue pullback, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe problems as investors saw it: a lower-than-expected employment report last week, weakness among tech stocks, ebbing consumer demand and renewed predictions of a potential recession.\n\nIt has not helped that economists disagree as they gaze into their crystal balls -- and data predictions in the recent past have turned out to be off the mark. There is no conclusive evidence that the economy is heading into recession, but investors Monday began to speculate that the Federal Reserve could decide to cushion the fallout with an emergency interest rate cut. Unlikely.\n\nThe financial markets are not the same as the fundamental economy, of course, but psychologically, Monday's plummet was unwelcome news for Americans who are retired or nearing retirement and relying on market-invested nest eggs. It was glum election-season news for Biden and Harris who understand Republicans are blaming them for inflated prices, the high costs of housing and gasoline pump prices. Harris's campaign themes to date have echoed Biden's: The U.S. economy is the envy of the world.\n\nTrump turned to social media Sunday to say, \"I TOLD YOU SO!\" while warning about a market \"crash.\" Harris \"DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE,\" he wrote. Trump's campaign emailed a statement Monday heaping blame on the Democratic nominee: \"The stock market is crashing because of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' policies and the world is on the brink of WW3.\"\n\nThe Dow dropped more than 1,000 points, or 2.6 percent Monday. The Nasdaq Composite lost 3.43 percent while the S&P 500 slid 3 percent. Japan's stock market posted its worst drop since Wall Street's Black Monday in 1987, contributing to fears of global turmoil in the markets (CNBC).\n\nExperts' advice Monday to investors: Do not panic; balance portfolios.\n\nThe U.S. economy has been cooling. That's been the stated goal of the Fed while it hiked interest rates by more than 5 percentage points over two years to battle inflation. The central bank is widely expected to begin cutting rates when policy makers meet Sept. 17-18.\n\nHARRIS NARROWLY LEADS Trump in pollster Nate Silver's election forecast for the first time since the model launched. She tops Trump by 1.4 percentage points in the Silver Bulletin's national polling average. The latest model shows Harris with 45.5 percent support compared to Trump's 44.1 percent (The Hill). According to a Decision Desk HQ/The Hill average of polls, Trump and Harris are tied nationally, each at 47 percent support.\n\nHarris has momentum but the race is still tight. NPR outlines the paths to the presidency for the candidates.\n\nROLEX AND A CYBERTRUCK: Trump appeared as a guest on video game streamer Adin Ross's livestream Monday, where the 23-year-old gifted the Republican presidential nominee a Rolex watch and a Cybertruck wrapped in a photo taken of him during the July 13 assassination attempt on his life. The 22-minute interview, broadcast on the gaming and live streaming platform Kick, took place in Trump's living room in Mar-a-Lago.\n\nDuring the livestream, Trump said Harris is \"actually worse\" than Biden (USA Today).\n\n\"She's ultra-left (and) ultra-radical,\" Trump said. \"We can't allow her to be president, she's going to destroy our country.\"\n\nADMINISTRATION\n\nLAST WEEK'S ABRUPT DECISION by Defense Secretary Austin to reject a plea deal in an election year that would have taken the death penalty off the table for three accused terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay since 2001 is controversial, unusual and an \"emotional whiplash\" for family members on all sides of the case, report The Hill's Ellen Mitchell and Brad Dress.\n\nAs back-to-school season ramps up, The Hill's Lexi Lonas examines the most pressing concerns for educators and students, from artificial intelligence (AI) bullying to students planning renewed protests against the war in Gaza.\n\nTENSIONS REMAIN HIGH in the Middle East, stoking fears of a wider war. The Biden administration is carrying out a full-court, diplomatic press on its allies and partners in the region to limit escalation in the likely attack by Iran and its proxies against Israel, but it faces fresh challenges as it seeks to replicate April's multinational coalition to help Israel intercept a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones.\n\nBiden and Harris on Monday convened in the situation room with their national security team as the region braces for Iran to retaliate for the assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders 10 months into the war in Gaza. Within hours of the White House announcement Monday, a spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry told a news conference that \"no one can weaken our determination to punish the aggressor\" behind the killing of the Hamas leader (The Hill and The Wall Street Journal).\n\n\"We don't want to see Iran take further action, and that's the message we are consistently delivering to our partners in the region,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at the Monday briefing. \"We're at a critical moment for the region, and it's important that all parties take steps over the coming days to refrain from escalation and calm tensions. Escalation is in no one's interest.\"\n\nVenezuela's opposition candidate trounced President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in last week's election, according to election tallies that show the opposition's Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez received more than double the votes of Maduro. Venezuela's National Electoral Council (NEC) declared Maduro the winner without initially publishing precinct-level results from the voting machines. Now, the country's Public Ministry has opened a criminal investigation into Gonz\u00e1lez and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, sparked by the two opposition figures' call for the military and police to stand \"on the side of the people\" in a Monday open letter (The Hill and CNN).\n\nCOURTS\n\nOUT OF JURISDICTION?: The Supreme Court on Monday declined to intervene in a long-shot lawsuit brought by Missouri attempting to block legal proceedings in Trump's hush money case in New York. The court rejected Missouri's bid to sue the state of New York, meaning the justices will not lift the gag order or delay sentencing in the unusual claim brought by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican who is running for a full term this fall. NBC News reported that the filing was perceived by many observers as a political stunt aimed at gaining publicity.\n\nETHICS: Biden has proposed changes that in effect place Supreme Court ethics on this year's ballots. At the same time, Justice Clarence Thomas's lucrative friendships remain in the headlines. Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said Monday that Thomas failed to disclose flights he and his wife took in 2010 between Hawaii and New Zealand on a private jet paid for by conservative benefactor Harlan Crow. \"I am deeply concerned that Mr. Crow may have been showering a public official with extravagant gifts, then writing off those gifts to lower his tax bill,\" Wyden wrote.\n\nTRUMP WORLD: Former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis agreed to a cooperation agreement with the Arizona attorney general in the state's \"fake electors\" case (NPR).\n\nTHE CLOSER\n\nAnd finally ... Some athletes at the Paris Olympics are winning medals ... and others are winning the internet.\n\nAmerican rugby sevens player Ilona Maher had a sizable internet following pre-Olympics, and managed to recruit retired NFL player Jason Kelce to her team's hype squad. Now, with a historic U.S. women's rugby bronze under her belt, that fan base is only growing.\n\nNorwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen's focus at the games was twofold: to compete in two freestyle races, and, based on his TikTok account, sing the praises of the dining hall chocolate muffins. The internet quickly dubbed him the \"Muffin Man.\"\n\nThen there's \"Pommel Horse Guy,\" or American gymnast Stephen Neodoroscik, a specialist whose skill is on a contraption that looks vaguely like a headless beast of burden with handles. After waiting patiently for hours during the men's team event, it was Neodoroscik's turn. Affectionately compared to Clark Kent, he calmly removed his glasses, did his thing and helped the U.S. secure a bronze. (His teammate, Frederick Richard, is an internet darling in his own right).", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His background as a retired Master Sergeant in the Army National Guard and a former high school teacher uniquely positions him as a leader who understands the values (and shortcomings) of military, educational, and governmental realms.\n\nRecently, his strong leadership and progressive values have placed him among those being considered as a potential vice presidential pick for Kamala Harris, further elevating his national profile and influence.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to stay ahead of the latest LGBTQ+ political news and insights.\n\nLet's take a closer look at who Tim Walz is along with his efforts to support and uplift the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nBorn on April 6, 1964, in West Point, Nebraska, Tim Walz grew up in the state's rural northwestern area of Valentine. He entered the Army National Guard in 1981 at the age of 17, serving 24 years and retiring as a Command Sergeant Major in 2005. In 1989, he earned a bachelor's in social science education from Chadron State College, and In 2001, he earned a master's in educational leadership from Minnesota State University, Mankato.\n\nWalz was a high school teacher and coach. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, representing Minnesota's 1st congressional district and winning re-election every two years until he became governor in 2018. In the House, he focused largely on veterans issues and became known for his bipartisanship. As governor, he focused on police and firearm reform, cannabis legalization, and educational funding. He won re-election as governor in 2022.\n\nWalz married his wife in 1994. They have two children.\n\nTim Walz has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights throughout his political career. His policies and actions reflect a commitment to equality and non-discrimination.\n\nWhen running for the House in 2006, Walz ran on a platform expressing support for same-sex marriage, which Minnesota banned in 1997.\n\nIn 2011, he announced his support for the Respect for Marriage Act, which aimed to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and ensure federal and state recognition of same-sex marriages. The act became law in December 2022.\n\nIn April 2021, when Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature introduced a bill that would ban transgender student-athletes from playing on sports teams matching their gender identity, Walz publicly signaled that he would veto the legislation if it made it to his desk, The Minnesota Reformer reported.\n\nIn an April 2021 social media post on X (then Twitter), Walz wrote, \"To all trans youth in Minnesota: You are loved and valued.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether Walz has made public statements about trans bathroom access. However, his strong support for trans rights and gender-affirming care suggests that he likely backs policies that allow trans individuals to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity.\n\nWhile working as a 35-year-old social studies teacher at Mankato West High School in 1999, Walz advised the school's first gay-straight alliance (GSA) supporting LGBTQ+ students.\n\nOn May 17, Gov. Walz signed legislation that stops libraries in the state from removing books \"based solely on the viewpoint, content, message, idea, or opinion conveyed,\" including LGBTQ+ themes.\n\nOn the day of the law's signing, Walz wrote, \"Censorship has no place in our libraries,\" Walz posted to X. \"As a former teacher, I'm clear: We need to remember our history, not erase it.\"\n\nWhile delivering his State of the State Address last April, Walz seemed to make a thinly veiled criticism of Florida's \"Don't say gay\" law banning classroom instruction on LGBTQ+ issues in schools.\n\n\"Look, I'm only the governor of this great state. It's not up to me how folks in places like Florida go about their business,\" Walz said. \"But I have to tell you, I'm pretty glad we do it our way and not their way. They're banishing books from their schools. We're banishing hunger from ours.\"\n\nLast May, Walz signed a bill outlawing the use of anti-LGBTQ+ \"panic defenses\" sometimes used by assailants in court to justify violence against queer victims.\n\nIn a 2009 House floor speech, Walz supported repealing \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" the military's ban on out gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members. \"Not once did I see that this nation was safer because a soldier was removed because of sexual orientation,\" he said.\n\nThat same year, he also helped facilitate the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a 2009 federal law that offers enhanced funding for and prosecution against hate crimes motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias, The Hill reported.\n\nIn 2023, Walz signed a statewide bill banning so-called conversion therapy, the widely discredited and disavowed practice of attempting to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe conversion therapy ban forbids any medical or mental healthcare practitioner from offering such therapy to minors and \"vulnerable\" adults. It also forbids any entities from publishing advertising that refers to LGBTQ+ identities as \"a mental disease, disorder or illness\" or promises to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. Practitioners who break the law could face discipline from the state's health licensing boards.\n\nDuring the law's signing ceremony, Walz stated, \"Minnesota says, 'Welcome to a state who values who you are and protects you for who you are.'\"\n\nIn April 2023, Walz signed a statewide law protecting gender-affirming care access. The law forbids state legal authorities from honoring any out-of-state subpoenas or arrest warrants seeking to bring civil or criminal actions against anyone who helps provide access to gender-affirming care. Such laws help protect families fleeing other states that have banned or criminalized gender-affirming care.\n\nHe signed a similar executive order in March 2023. His order required the Minnesota Department of Health to prepare a report summarizing scientific evidence about the safety and effectiveness of gender-affirming health care. It also directed statewide government offices to ensure that medical insurers have clear policies on their coverage for gender-affirming care.\n\n\"We want every Minnesotan to grow up feeling safe, valued, protected, celebrated, and free to exist as their authentic versions of themselves,\" Walz said in a press release about the order. \"Protecting and supporting access to gender-affirming health care is essential to being a welcoming and supportive state.\"\n\nTim Walz is a dedicated public servant and a staunch ally of the LGBTQ+ community. His policies and advocacy work reflect his commitment to equality, inclusion, and the protection of rights for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nAs a leader, Walz continues to champion causes that promote social justice and equity, making significant strides in advancing LGBTQ+ rights in Minnesota and beyond.\n\nSubscribe to the LGBTQ Nation

UAW expressed its support for Harris on July 31 in a statement made by its International Executive Board.\n\n\"Our job in this election is to defeat Donald Trump and elect Kamala Harris to build on her proven track record of delivering for the working class,\" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a news release. \"We stand at a crossroads in this country. We can put a billionaire back in office who stands against everything our union stands for, or we can elect Kamala Harris who will stand shoulder to shoulder with us in our war on corporate greed.\"\n\nThe board says it picked Harris for voting against trade deals like NAFTA, NAFTA 2.0, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. They say she also picketed alongside autoworkers during a 2019 strike.\n\nFain has said that while the union supports Harris, it would not endorse Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. In the past, Shapiro supported school-choice vouchers, while detractors argue Kelly opposed a labor organizing bill.\n\nWhile Shapiro and Kelly are mentioned to be among the finalists, Minnesota Gov.

Mark Kelly, according to multiple media reports.\n\nWalz, considered a moderate Democrat with progressive leanings who recently made state-funded school lunch his signature achievement, served as a representative for Minnesota from 2007-2019 until he was elected governor.\n\nOther accomplishments include expanding voting rights for formerly incarcerated residents and protecting LBGTQ+ rights with gender-affirming health care and banning conversion therapy.\n\nIn April 2023, he also signed the Reproductive Freedom Defense Act. It protects patients traveling to the state for an abortion and their providers from legal attacks and criminal penalties imposed by other states.\n\nEven before naming her VP, Harris had already secured enough votes to lock down the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the party's national convention, which will be held in Chicago from Aug. 19-22. Delegates to the convention voted via a virtual roll call.\n\nIt's been less than a month since President Joe Biden said he was bowing out of the 2024 presidential race on July 21. Harris has already raised $310 million in just 11 days, her office reported last week.\n\nOn the day he stepped down, Biden gave Harris his blessing as the party's new nominee, saying he was \"passing the torch to a new generation.\" She has also secured the backing of Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as key Democratic Party members including Nancy Pelosi.\n\nCelebrities and activists have flocked to her campaign, with multiple demographic-specific Zoom calls that included support from such famous fans as Jeff Bridges and Pink.\n\nAnother Zoom fundraiser, Comics for Kamala, was scheduled for Monday evening. The headliners include both comedians and other celebrities, such as Jon Hamm, Ben Stiller, Kathryn Hahn, Cecily Strong and Rosie O'Donnell.\n\nMore surprisingly, the former California Attorney General has received the endorsement of several former GOP politicians, including Rod Chandler of Washington, Tom Coleman of Missouri and Susan Molinari of New York, as Newsweek reported.", "source":

Bernie Sanders signaled support for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris selecting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential candidate for the November election.\n\nSanders (I-Vt.) did not immediately endorse Harris last month after President Joe Biden dropped out of the contest against Republican former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio). Sanders explained that \"I just want to make sure that her campaign understands that for too many people in this country, when they look at Washington, D.C., they feel ignored. They feel insulted that people are not understanding what is going on in their lives.\"\n\nAs Harris on Friday officially secured enough delegates to get the Democratic nomination, Sanders attended a town hall in Mankato and spoke with Minnesota Public Radio host Tom Crann, who asked him about his positions on Harris and Walz -- a vice presidential contender backed by a growing number of progressives and Democrats.\n\n\"I'm gonna do everything that I can to see that Donald Trump is defeated and that Kamala Harris will become the next president of the United States,\" Sanders said. \"I think she has a strong record to run on along with President Biden and I think and believe that she is going to be speaking out not only on issues of climate change, not only on issues of women having the right to control their own body, not only protecting our democracy, but the needs of working families.\"\n\nAs for Harris' vice presidential pick, Sanders said: \"Well, I had the opportunity to talk to your governor a few days ago and I am very impressed by him. I think you have an excellent governor who understands the needs of working families. So I hope very much that the vice president selects a running mate who will speak up and take on powerful corporate interests, and I think Tim Walz is somebody who could do that.\"\n\nThe Associated Pressreported Friday that Harris' weekend interview list includes Walz, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), and Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, JB Pritzker of Illinois, and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Shapiro's record on climate, school vouchers, and Palestine has provoked impassioned warnings from progressives.\n\nAccording toCNN, \"renewed focus is being placed\" on Walz, who is set to meet with Harris on Sunday.\n\nWalz is a former teacher and coach who served in the Army National Guard and U.S. House of Representatives. Last year, he and state lawmakers with the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party passed nearly every item on a \"transformational\" agenda, including measures on free school meals at public and charter schools, marijuana legalization, and paid family and medical leave.\n\n\"There's a lot of pain out there. Working people are struggling and they're seeing massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and what they want is political leadership in Washington and all over this country to start paying attention to their needs,\" Sanders said Friday. \"And that means, to my mind, a bunch of pieces of legislation that we've got to pass.\"\n\n\"The time is long overdue for Washington to stop worrying about the billionaires and their campaign contributors and start worrying about the needs of working families,\" he added, pushing for improvements to Medicare and Social Security.\n\nAfter the interview and Mankato event, Sanders headed to Minneapolis for a get-out-the-vote rally with two Democrats who represent Minnesota in Congress -- Sen. Tina Smith and Rep. Ilhan Omar -- in anticipation of the state's August 13 primary.\n\nOmar is facing a primary challenge from Don Samuels, a former Minneapolis City Council member. Sanders told MPR that \"I think in Ilhan you have a member of Congress who really is one of the outstanding members. She's a woman of courage.\"\n\nSanders praised Omar -- who earlier this year spoke on Sanders' podcast about coming to the United States as a refugee from Somalia -- for her work to improve the lives of children and her criticism of the U.S.-backed Israeli war on the Gaza Strip.\n\nHighlighting Omar's record of \"representing the needs of working families in general,\" Sanders -- who is up for reelection in Vermont this year -- added that \"I'm a strong supporter of Ilhan. I look forward to being with her tomorrow.\"\n\nMinnesota-based Bring Me the Newsreported that during the Saturday event, \"Sens. Sanders and Smith emphasized how important it was to encourage community members to vote in the presidential and primary elections.\"\n\n\"I am begging you this afternoon to remember that our struggle is not over when Kamala gets elected. We are taking on the greed of a billionaire class,\" Sanders said. \"If we stand together as working-class people, we can win this thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town hall meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankato,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will introduce her running mate in front of 10,000 people at a college basketball arena Tuesday afternoon. What her campaign team expects to be a highly visual, enthusiastic, televised event will mark the starting point of an intense five-day tour of the seven key swing states, those that will really count in the November elections. At the same time, at another sports arena in the city's south side, Republican vice-presidential candidate J. D. Vance will promote his political platform at a parallel rally.\n\nThat Harris has chosen Philadelphia to launch her tour, and to present her vice-presidential pick, and that Vance will be there on the same day is, of course, no coincidence. If election campaigns can be compared to wars, what is being fought in Pennsylvania would be the battle of Stalingrad in World War II: the most pivotal of the entire conflict, the most closely fought, the one that neither side can afford to lose. The one that will end up tilting the outcome to one side or the other.\n\nThis is so because of the particularity of the U.S. electoral system, in which it is not necessarily the candidate who gains the most votes who wins, but the one who manages to obtain 270 votes in the electoral college. In this institution, each state has a certain number of votes according to its size and population. Those votes are awarded as a block (with exceptions in Maine and one district in Nebraska) to the candidate who wins there.\n\nMost states are traditionally aligned with one party or the other. Broadly speaking, the coasts, the northern industrial belt, Colorado and New Mexico vote Democratic; the Midwest and the South lean Republican. But neither bloc is enough to add up to 270 electoral votes. Therefore, the real deciders are the handful of swing states, which in this election year are Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nOf all of these Pennsylvania, the most populous, offers the biggest reward in votes: 19. An essential state that both Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, need to win at all costs to secure the keys to the White House.\n\nThe Democratic candidate has thrown all of her campaign weight at Pennsylvania, a state that Joe Biden -- originally from there and who boasts of his working-class roots in Scranton, an industrial town -- won in 2020 by 80,000 votes, and which four years earlier had leaned towards Trump. Harris has already visited Pennsylvania several times. Democrats have invested in advertising and in mobilizing volunteers.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has emerged as an early favorite to run alongside Harris, due his communication skills, his telegenics, his long record of accomplishments and a reputation as a moderate that balances out the progressive aura of the former California senator. And also because of his immense popularity in Pennsylvania, which stands at 61% according to some polls with 42% of Republican voters giving him their approval.\n\nThe former state attorney general, strategists believe, could scratch up a not necessarily huge, but significant, number of votes in his home state that would tip Pennsylvania to the Democratic side: and with Pennsylvania, the electoral college.\n\nBut while Pennsylvania is the make-or-break state of the electoral contest, the two parties also need to take advantage of other states in play. Hence Harris and her running mate's whistlestop tour to Eau Claire (Wisconsin), Detroit (Michigan), Durham (North Carolina), Savannah (Georgia), Phoenix (Arizona) and Las Vegas, (Nevada). Vance will follow a similar route on the same days. Until Biden withdrew from the presidential race two weeks ago, Trump was ahead in the polls in all those states. In some, like Nevada, he held a substantial lead.\n\nA fortnight after Harris took the baton from Biden, the tables appear to be turning. The vice-president has closed the gap on her Republican rival in the polls, which now show a technical tie. Some have Harris ahead in certain key states. The most recent one, published by the CBS television network Sunday, forecasts a voting intention of 50% to the Democratic candidate, compared to 49% for Trump.\n\nAccording to this analysis, the former president is ahead of his rival in North Carolina, Georgia, and Wisconsin; both are equal in Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania; Harris is ahead in Nevada.\n\nThese are numbers that Harris' campaign has welcomed with enthusiasm. Two weeks ago, in the same poll, Biden was six percentage points behind Trump. The former president was winning in every swing state and even gaining ground in traditionally Democratic territories.\n\nThe optimism generated by the Democratic surge has handed Harris additional advantages: the donations faucet has been turned back on and pulled in over $300 million last month, giving the Democratic coffers a $60 million advantage in cash on hand. An advantage they plan to employ in investing in ads in swing states, among other things. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers have also signed up for the campaign: a total of 370,000 new pairs of hands, including 15,500 in Georgia, 21,000 in Arizona, and 10,500 in North Carolina.\n\n\"In Nevada, Team Harris has 13 offices, while Trump has just one,\" the director of the Democratic campaign in the swing states, Dan Kanninen, noted in a memo. \"In Pennsylvania, we have 36 coordinated offices while Trump has just three. In Georgia, we have 24 offices while the Trump team didn't open their first until June.\"\n\nIn Georgia alone -- a state that went Biden's way in 2020 by just 12,000 votes, based on a mass mobilization of its large Black community, a very young population, and arrivals from other states to take advantage of one of the most dynamic economies in the entire country -- Harris' candidacy has put 100,000 votes in play from people who until now leaned towards the Republicans or did not plan to vote at all, according to Axios. The vice president and Trump both visited Atlanta and held rallies in the same place just four days apart last week.\n\nIn Arizona, the Democrat has picked up a number of endorsements from mayors in border towns, including Republican-held Mesa, something that bolsters her campaign in one of the areas in which the Republicans have attacked her most insistently: immigration policy.\n\nOf the seven swing states, perhaps the most uphill battle for the Democrats is North Carolina, which has only swung to their side twice so far this century. But, like Georgia, its demographics are changing, due to an influx of younger people from other states. Running as the Republican candidate for governor is the current number two, the very conservative Mark Robinson, which may also open up opportunities for Harris' campaign according to her strategists.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "macarena_vidal_liy@english.elpais.com", "name": "Macarena Vidal Liy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

His ability to deliver \"memorable haymakers\" against Republicans, as well as his personal story of overcoming infertility struggles, have endeared him to many in the Democratic base.\n\nAs governor, Walz has navigated a divided government, but the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party's recent trifecta victory in Minnesota has allowed him to sign into law a raft of expansive social welfare programs and progressive policies, including abortion rights protections and gun safety measures.\n\nDemocratic strategist Raghu Devaguptapu described Walz as a \"real steady hand\" and a \"thoughtful, very likeable\" figure who has built a broad coalition of support.", "source": {"uri": "dimsumdaily.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dimsum Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dimsumdaily_hong_kong@dimsumdaily.hk", "name": "Dimsumdaily Hong Kong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_trifecta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government trifecta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.dimsumdaily.hk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/06211128/Gov.-Tim-Walz-.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788903", "eventUri": "eng-9788903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

He spent most of his childhood in Valentine before his family moved to Butte during his sophomore year of high school.\n\nHe graduated from Butte High School in 1982. But even before completing high school, just two days after turning 17, he got his family's permission to enlist in the Nebraska Army National Guard.\n\nGuard records show he completed his basic training in the summer before his senior year at Butte.\n\nWalz enrolled at Chadron State in 1982 and used the GI bill to complete his degree in education in 1989. For a time in 1985, he also took classes in East Asia Studies at the University of Houston.\n\nAfter graduating from Chadron, the sergeant briefly served full time in the guard at the armory in Alliance.\n\nBut in 1990, he left that job to spend a year teaching in China as part of Harvard University's WorldTeach program. He taught American history, culture and English to Chinese high school students.\n\nHe called it a once in a lifetime experience, finding the people in the Communist country kind and generous. Though his students did not celebrate Christmas, they cut down a pine tree, decorated it and brought it to his room on Christmas Eve.\n\n\"Going there was one of the best things I've ever done,\" he later told the Nebraska guard's newspaper after he returned to his home state and resumed his guard service.\n\nFollowing the year teaching in China, Walz became a teacher in Alliance, teaching social studies and geography to middle school and high school students. He was known for leading groups of students on summer trips abroad to China.\n\nDuring his years in Alliance, he also met his wife, Gwen, a native of Minnesota. The two got married during a trip to China and spent their honeymoon leading two high school tour groups.\n\nThen in 1996, the couple moved to Mankato, Minnesota, Gwen's hometown. There, he continued to teach and serve in the guard, ultimately retiring after 24 years of total guard service.\n\nMinnesota was also where Walz launched his political career. In 2006, the Democrat ran for an won a seat in Congress, upsetting a six-term incumbent Republican. After six terms in Washington, he was elected Minnesota governor in 2018 and re-elected in 2022.\n\nIn 2014, the then-congressman returned to Chadron State to give the commencement address and to receive a distinguished alumni award.\n\nWalz said he appreciated that his alma mater provided middle class families like his the opportunity to earn a college education.\n\n\"The professors at this college wanted us to succeed,\" Walz said during his visit. \"The door was always open for us to learn and to grow.\"\n\nOur best Omaha staff photos & videos of August 2024", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_j_cordes@omaha.com", "name": "Henry J.

Likewise, in 2016, newly selected running mate Sen.

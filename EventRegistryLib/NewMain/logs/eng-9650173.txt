The United States on Thursday, June 13, 2024 granted the Makah Indian Tribe in Washington state a long-sought waiver that helps clear the way for its first sanctioned whale hunts since 1999. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)SEATTLE (AP) - The United States granted the Makah Indian Tribe in Washington state a long-sought waiver Thursday that helps clear the way for its first sanctioned whale hunts since 1999. The Makah, a tribe of 1,500 people on the northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, is the only Native American tribe with a treaty that specifically mentions a right to hunt whales. But it has faced more than two decades of court challenges, bureaucratic hearings and scientific review as it seeks to resume hunting for gray whales. The decision by NOAA Fisheries grants a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which otherwise forbids harming marine mammals. It allows the tribe to hunt up to 25 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with a limit of two to three per year. There are roughly 20,000 whales in that population, and the hunts will be timed to avoid harming endangered Western North Pacific gray whales that sometimes visit the area. Nevertheless, some hurdles remain. The tribe must enter into a cooperative agreement with the agency under the Whaling Convention Act, and it must obtain a permit to hunt, a process that involves a monthlong public comment period. Animal rights advocates, who have long opposed whaling, could also challenge NOAA's decision in court. Archeological evidence shows that Makah hunters in cedar canoes killed whales for sustenance from time immemorial, a practice that ceased only in the early 20th century after commercial whaling vessels depleted the population. By 1994, the Eastern Pacific gray whale population had rebounded, and they were removed from the endangered species list. Seeing an opportunity to reclaim its heritage, the tribe announced plans to hunt again. The Makah trained for months in the ancient ways of whaling and received the blessing of federal officials and the International Whaling Commission. They took to the water in 1998 but didn't succeed until the next year, when they harpooned a gray whale from a hand-carved cedar canoe. A tribal member in a motorized support boat killed it with a high-powered rifle to minimize its suffering. It was the tribe's first successful hunt in 70 years. The hunts drew protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Others veered motorboats between the whales and the tribal canoes to interfere with the hunt. Authorities seized several vessels and made arrests. After animal rights groups sued, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned federal approval of the tribe's whaling plans. The court found that the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act. Eleven Alaska Native communities in the Arctic have such a waiver for subsistence hunts, allowing them to kill bowhead whales - even though bowheads are listed as endangered. The Makah tribe applied for a waiver in 2005. The process repeatedly stalled as new scientific information about the whales and the health of their population was uncovered. Some of the Makah whalers became so frustrated with the delays that they went on a rogue hunt in 2007, killing a gray whale that got away from them and sank.

But it has faced more than two decades of court challenges, bureaucratic hearings and scientific review as it seeks to resume hunting for gray whales.\n\nThe decision by NOAA Fisheries grants a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which otherwise forbids harming marine mammals. It allows the tribe to hunt up to 25 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with a limit of two to three per year. There are roughly 20,000 whales in that population.\n\nThe tribe celebrated the decision but said it took far too long.\n\n\"Whaling remains central to the identity, culture, subsistence, and spirituality of the Makah people, and we regard the gray whale as sacred,\" Makah Tribal Council chairman Timothy J. Greene Sr said in a written statement.\n\n\"In the time since our last successful hunt in 1999, we have lost many elders who held the knowledge of our whaling customs, and another entire generation of Makahs has grown up without the ability to exercise our treaty right or experience the connections and benefits of whaling that our ancestors secured for us.\"\n\nThe hunts will be timed in an effort to avoid harming endangered Western North Pacific gray whales that sometimes visit the area - about 200 to 300 remain - as well as a group of about 200 gray whales that generally spend summer and fall feeding along the northwest coast.\n\nNevertheless, some hurdles remain. The tribe must enter into a co-operative agreement with the agency under the Whaling Convention Act, and it must obtain a permit to hunt, a process that involves a month-long public comment period.\n\nAnimal rights advocates, who have long opposed whaling, could also challenge NOAA's decision in court. DJ Schubert, a senior wildlife biologist with the Washington, DC-based Animal Welfare Institute, said his organisation would object to the issuance of the hunt permit but likely wait until final approvals are given before deciding whether to sue.\n\nHe noted that while the Eastern North Pacific gray whale population appears healthy now, it has fluctuated wildly in recent years, and no one knows how the whales will fare as climate change continues to affect the Arctic. Scientists estimate that as much as 40 per cent of the population died off from 2018 to last year before it began to recover.\n\n\"We completely respect the tribe's cultural practices and traditions,\" Schubert said. \"We just fundamentally disagree that they need to hunt whales to continue those traditions. We hope that as this decision-making process plays out, perhaps the Makah Tribe and the government could reconsider the need to hunt whales and advocate for protection instead of persecution.\"\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that Makah hunters in cedar canoes killed whales for sustenance from time immemorial, a practice that ceased only in the early 20th century after commercial whaling vessels depleted the population.\n\nBy 1994, the Eastern Pacific gray whale population had rebounded, and they were removed from the endangered species list. Seeing an opportunity to reclaim its heritage, the tribe announced plans to hunt again.\n\nThe Makah trained for months in the ancient ways of whaling and received the blessing of federal officials and the International Whaling Commission. They took to the water in 1998 but didn't succeed until the next year, when they harpooned a gray whale from a hand-carved cedar canoe. A tribal member in a motorised support boat killed it with a high-powered rifle to minimise its suffering.\n\nIt was the tribe's first successful hunt in 70 years.\n\nThe hunts drew protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Others veered motorboats between the whales and the tribal canoes to interfere with the hunt. Authorities seized several vessels and made arrests.\n\nAfter animal rights groups sued, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned federal approval of the tribe's whaling plans. The court found that the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\nEleven Alaska Native communities in the Arctic have such a waiver for subsistence hunts, allowing them to kill bowhead whales - even though bowheads are listed as endangered.\n\nThe Makah Tribe applied for a waiver in 2005. The process repeatedly stalled as new scientific information about the whales and the health of their population was uncovered.\n\nSome of the Makah whalers became so frustrated with the delays that they went on a rogue hunt in 2007, killing a gray whale that got away from them and sank.

It allows the tribe to hunt up to 25 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with a limit of two to three per year.

They took to the water in 1998 but didn't succeed until the next year, when they harpooned a gray whale from a hand-carved cedar canoe. A tribal member in a motorized support boat killed it with a high-powered rifle to minimize its suffering.\n\nIt was the tribe's first successful hunt in 70 years.\n\nThe hunts drew protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces.

Greene Sr. said in a written statement. \"In the time since our last successful hunt in 1999, we have lost many elders who held the knowledge of our whaling customs, and another entire generation of Makahs has grown up without the ability to exercise our Treaty right or experience the connections and benefits of whaling that our ancestors secured for us.\"\n\nThe hunts will be timed in an effort to avoid harming endangered Western North Pacific gray whales that sometimes visit the area -- about 200 to 300 remain -- as well as a group of about 200 gray whales that generally spend summer and fall feeding along the Northwest coast.\n\nNevertheless, some hurdles remain. The tribe must enter into a cooperative agreement with the agency under the Whaling Convention Act, and it must obtain a permit to hunt, a process that involves a monthlong public comment period.\n\nAnimal rights advocates, who have long opposed whaling, could also challenge NOAA's decision in court. DJ Schubert, a senior wildlife biologist with the Washington, D.C.-based Animal Welfare Institute, said his organization would object to the issuance of the hunt permit but likely wait until final approvals are given before deciding whether to sue.\n\nHe noted that while the Eastern North Pacific gray whale population appears healthy now, it has fluctuated wildly in recent years, and no one knows how the whales will fare as climate change continues to affect the Arctic. Scientists estimate that as much as 40% of the population died off from 2018 to last year before it began to recover.\n\n\"We completely respect the tribe's cultural practices and traditions,\" Schubert said. \"We just fundamentally disagree that they need to hunt whales to continue those traditions. We hope that as this decision-making process plays out, perhaps the Makah Tribe and the government could reconsider the need to hunt whales and advocate for protection instead of persecution.\"\n\nArcheological evidence shows that Makah hunters in cedar canoes killed whales for sustenance from time immemorial, a practice that ceased only in the early 20th century after commercial whaling vessels depleted the population.\n\nBy 1994, the Eastern Pacific gray whale population had rebounded, and they were removed from the endangered species list.

Scientists estimate that as much as 40% of the population died off from 2018 to last year before it began to recover.\n\n\"We completely respect the tribe's cultural practices and traditions,\" Schubert said. \"We just fundamentally disagree that they need to hunt whales to continue those traditions.

The process repeatedly stalled as new scientific information about the whales and the health of their population was uncovered.\n\nSome of the Makah whalers became so frustrated with the delays that they went on a rogue hunt in 2007, killing a gray whale that got away from them and sank.

But it has faced more than two decades of court challenges, bureaucratic hearings and scientific review as it seeks to resume hunting for gray whales.\n\nThe decision by NOAA Fisheries grants a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which otherwise forbids harming marine mammals. It allows the tribe to hunt up to 25 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with a limit of two to three per year. There are roughly 20,000 whales in that population, and the hunts will be timed to avoid harming endangered Western North Pacific gray whales that sometimes visit the area.\n\nNevertheless, some hurdles remain. The tribe must enter into a cooperative agreement with the agency under the Whaling Convention Act, and it must obtain a permit to hunt, a process that involves a monthlong public comment period.\n\nAnimal rights advocates, who have long opposed whaling, could also challenge NOAA's decision in court.\n\nArcheological evidence shows that Makah hunters in cedar canoes killed whales for sustenance from time immemorial, a practice that ceased only in the early 20th century after commercial whaling vessels depleted the population.

A federal official has given the green light for members of the Makah tribe to resume exercising their treaty right to whaling, based on a request first made in 2005. Their last hunt took place in 1999.\n\nWith a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act in hand, the tribe will be authorized to hunt and kill up to three eastern North Pacific gray whales per year over the next decade.\n\nTheir hunt could start as soon as this summer or fall, although the tribe said a hunt this fall or later is more likely. Makah officials must first secure a permit from the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n\nThe Tribe and officials from NOAA Fisheries must enter into a cooperative agreement honoring internationally established quotas under the Whaling Convention Act. And dozens of young men in the whaling crew need to be physically and spiritually ready.\n\nJanine Ledford, executive director of the Makah Cultural and Research Center in Neah Bay, recalled the feeling she had as a young woman witnessing the whale hunt in 1999. The 25 years that have passed since then have amplified that feeling.\n\n\"It's actually pretty hard to put to words, but it's monumental, it's really incredible,\" Ledford said in anticipation of the decision.\n\n\"When you're resuming something that is so central and so important - that our ancestors never let us forget about.\"\n\nShe said there is also sadness and frustration about the many people who died waiting to see the revival of the whale hunt. But there are equal numbers of young people who have been waiting and have set their sights on supporting it in some way.\n\n\"Everybody here is involved in one way or another. We've never lost sight of the importance of whales and whale hunting,\" Ledford said. \"You know, we weren't hunting for roughly 80 years, but that didn't mean that our community - that our tribe, you know - forgot how important whales are to us.\"\n\nSince 1999, the tribe has continued to nurture the whaling culture and customs as best they can, without actually going on a hunt. Stranded and entangled whales are sometimes brought to Makah beaches for traditional processing, as recently as in 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe hunt is to be conducted using traditional methods, such as hand-carved canoes and harpoons. As in 1999, Makah hunters will also use modern equipment, including motorized chase-boats and a high-powered rifle to quickly kill the whale after it is struck.\n\nIt has been nearly 25 years since whalers from the Makah tribe killed a gray whale and triumphantly towed it back to Neah Bay in Northwest Washington. Fists raised and facing virulent protests from animal rights activists, the successful hunt in May 1999 represented a key moment in their efforts to exercise tribal treaty rights and to revive important cultural traditions.\n\nBut the glory didn't last long. Animal rights activists staged protests and made physical threats serious enough that the tribe put up a checkpoint on the only road into remote Neah Bay, to protect against violence. A series of lawsuits shut down the hunt and prevented any additional legal attempts to take more whales. The tribe's leadership has abided by U.S. and international regulations, testing their patience for decades. Now, only minor bureaucratic hurdles remain till the tribe can revive the whale hunt.\n\nAhead of the final decision, Makah Tribal Council Chairman TJ Greene told KNKX the tribe will be ready to respond to violent protests or any other form of opposition to their hunt this time around.\n\n\"It's terribly frustrating, it's incredibly frustrating to be in this process and to see what a small tribe like Makah has to go through, to exercise its treaty right. Something that's been guaranteed since 1855,\" Greene said. \"People are missing that part of their culture, of their teachings, of the things that they've put into that.\"\n\nHe said it's not yet clear to him how long the permitting process with NMFS will take. Additionally, he noted that the waiver covers a 10-year period for the whale hunt, yet the permits will have to be renewed every three to five years, placing additional bureaucratic burdens on the tribe.\n\n\"And we've been in this administrative process for a good 20 years,\" he said.\n\nGreene said this uncertainty about the future is unnecessary.\n\n\"Our reserved rights are in perpetuity and do not have an expiration.\"\n\nRelated: Tribe wins major step toward resuming whaling off Washington's Olympic Penninsula\n\nIn acknowledgement of the long wait, NOAA Fisheries added a clause to their waiver that would allow the Makah Tribe to start their hunt mid-season, if they so choose. This new flexibility is meant to help the tribe to get back to their traditions as soon as possible.\n\nFor as long as anyone can remember, the Makah people have relied on the ocean for their livelihood. At the center of this was a whaling tradition so strong that, unlike any others among the federally recognized tribes in the Pacific Northwest, Makah leaders secured whaling in their treaty with the United States. Article 4 of the 1855 Treaty of Neah Bay lists \"the right of taking fish and of whaling or sealing at usual and accustomed grounds and stations.\"\n\nIn the 1920s, the tribe voluntarily stopped whaling, when its hunters saw how unregulated commercial hunting had greatly reduced the eastern North Pacific gray whale population. The Makahs announced their intent to resume whaling in 1995, one year after federal officials announced the whales had recovered and removed them from the Federal List of Endangered Wildlife.\n\nA recent die-off of gray whales that is linked to climate change is part of what delayed the current waiver for so long.\n\nThe final decision did not come through till the conclusion of the so-called Unusual Mortality Event that killed off about a third of the gray whales that migrate along the West Coast. They are rebounding now and officials say the small quota allowed for the Makahs will not pose any threat to the overall population.\n\nTo be certain of that, a new provision in the waiver approved on Thursday is the requirement for verification that the species has reached its \"optimum sustainable population\" level before the hunt. NOAA Fisheries spokesperson Michael Milstein told KNKX the current count of the gray whales has already met this criteria.\n\nHe said there is also a new provision to protect any western North Pacific gray whales, which are endangered. They don't normally frequent the area where the Makah hunt is authorized, but some have strayed in the past. The tribe is to assure officials they have a plan to avoid this species before they go out on a hunt. If there is a possibility of an accidental strike, they are to apply for an incidental take permit, under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nIn an interview before their waiver received approval, Greene said the tribe keeps tabs on the state of the whales and would never take action to harm the population. Makah traditions include spiritual practices meant to keep both the whales and humans healthy.\n\n\"We have greater love and greater care than anyone in the world, we believe, because of the things that we do to honor not just that whale and that spirit, but also the environment that it lives in,\" Greene said.\n\nAnd he said their treaty also protects the whales, by recognizing the Makah right to the hunt.\n\n\"Because there's a legal obligation of the federal government to honor those reserved rights, and to make sure that those stocks are healthy.\"\n\nCOIVD-19 also slowed the wheels of bureaucracy in the years after an administrative law judge issued his recommendation in favor of the hunt. That was in 2021, two years after a weeklong public hearing in Seattle.\n\nAt that time, the animal rights activists that so vehemently opposed the 1999 hunt testified against the proposed waiver. Sea Shepherd Legal, the Animal Welfare Institute and the Peninsula Citizens for the Protection of Whales all voiced their continued opposition.\n\nBut the tribe said the atmosphere had changed; they no longer felt physically threatened by the militant protests that shut the hunt down nearly 25 years ago. And more of the general public seemed sympathetic to their desire to keep their culture alive.\n\nIt is hard to know how the Makah whale hunt will play out this time. Sea Shepherd has not responded to KNKX's requests for comment on what shape the opposition from animal rights groups might take this time around.\n\nRelated: The 50th anniversary of the Boldt Decision is a celebration of Native leadership\n\nSea Shepherd Legal, which has since disbanded, issued the following statement ahead of the 2019 administrative hearing in Seattle:\n\n\"Sea Shepherd opposes the intentional killing of cetaceans, no matter the circumstances. From the Faroe Islands to Iceland, from Japan to Norway, Sea Shepherd's opposition to whaling is categorical and uncompromising.\"\n\nThe Peninsula Citizens for the Protection of Whales also did not respond to KNKX's interview request.\n\nNOAA Fisheries said the legal process for granting a waiver for hunting under the Marine Mammal Protections Act is clearer now, because of past litigation. And the agency has followed it carefully, with all the important comment periods and analyses required by the law and verified by the courts.\n\n\"While that took time, it also helped the public see and understand the questions involved and the care with which we answered them,\" said Milstein, the NOAA Fisheries spokesperson.\n\nThe hope is that this has improved public understanding of tribal culture and of the low risk to the whales posed by the proposed hunt - enough that the hunt might take place more peacefully this time around.", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType": "news",

That's set to change after a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration decision, the New York Times reports. The Washington state tribe has been granted a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act that will allow it to hunt up to 25 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over the next 10 years, reports the AP. The tribe, which applied for the waiver almost 20 years ago, will be allowed to hunt two or three whales a year from a population believed to number around 20,000.\n\nFor centuries, the tribe hunted whales from cedar canoes, but they stopped in the 1920s after commercial whaling devastated whale populations. By 1994, decades after the end of most commercial whaling, Eastern North Pacific gray whales were taken off the endangered list. After a long legal battle, the tribe won federal approval to resume hunting in the late 1990s. They successfully hunted a single gray whale in 1999 amid fierce opposition from animal rights activists, who used motorized boats to block the tribe's canoes and scare away whales, the Times reports. A federal appeals court halted the hunts in 2000.\n\nJanet Coit, assistant administrator for NOAA Fisheries, said the decision is a \"major milestone in the process to return ceremonial and subsistence hunting\" of whales to the tribe. \"The measures adopted today honor the Makah Tribe's treaty rights and their cultural whaling tradition that dates back well over 1,000 years, and is fundamental to their identity and heritage,\" Coit said in a statement Thursday.

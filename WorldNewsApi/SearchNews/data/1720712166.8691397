Action Network is the official betting partner of the Chicago Tribune One of America\u2019s most popular sports betting sites, BetMGM, provides users a dual offer structure in 19 states. Sign up with the BetMGM bonus code TRIB1600 for a 20 percent deposit match capped at $1.6K or use the BetMGM bonus code TRIBUNENEWS to claim a $1.5K first bet insurance. Based on the structure of the deposit match, you\u2019ll need to put down $8,000 in total to get the value $1.6K value. Additionally, there\u2019s a 10x wager requirement within the first 30 days. So if you put down $500 in cash, you\u2019d get $100 in sports bonuses. From that point, you\u2019d have to wager $1,000 in 30 days. The bet insurance offer is much more direct. You\u2019ll some bonus bets back \u2014 based on the value of your first cash wager of the day \u2014 if you lose. So if you place a cash bet of $100 to start the day that settles as a loss, and then wager $250, you\u2019d get $100 in bonus bets based on your first wager. Despite the difference in title, sports bonuses function the same way as bonus bets. They can be wagered on any market but cannot be withdrawn without being wagered first. Both promotions are available in all 19 states (AZ, CO, IL, IN, IA, LA, KS, KY, MA, MD, MI, NJ, NC, OH, PA, TN, VA, WV, WY) where BetMGM operates. 20% Deposit Match w/ $1.6K cap $1.5K First Bet Insurance Important T&Cs New customers only 21+ only Available for visitors to legal states, residency not required $10 cash deposit required for either promotion Any credits distributed to account within 72 hours of bet settlement, valid for seven days from point of distribution 10x play-through for deposit match How to sign up with BetMGM Use either the modules or the hyperlinks to access BetMGM, based on what promotion you want to claim When prompted, input either TRIB1600 for the deposit match or TRIBUNENEWS Finalize your account with relevant personal details (home address, birth date etc.) Deposit $10 in cash to register your account Place your first cash wager How to wager with BetMGM Given the differences in each of the promotions, each offer has an ideal use case. With the deposit match, there\u2019s a play-through requirement over the first 30 days, thus it makes sense to slowly chip away with smaller cash wagers. On the other hand, the bet insurance offer is ideal for an underdog market. If your bet wins, you\u2019ll collect an outsized profit and if you lose you\u2019ll recover the value of your cash stake as bonus bets, valid for seven days. Say, for example you place a $270 cash bet on the Mavs moneyline at +222 you\u2019d get $599.40 in profit. If that wager lost, you\u2019d get $270 in bonus bets credited to your account. If you\u2019re claiming the deposit match and put down a cash stake $300, you\u2019d get $60 in sports bonuses to your account. From that point, you\u2019d have 30 days to bet $600 in total. So you could place a $100 cash wager on Jaylen Brown as a First FG Scorer at +550 and potentially collect $550 in profit with a win. Regardless of how it settles, you\u2019d then have to bet $500 more to meet the wager requirement. 21+. Gambling problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER.

The biggest charity football match in the world, Soccer Aid has gone on to raise more than \u00a390milllion for global children's charity UNICEF since its creation. But who exactly is the event's co-founder, Jonathan Wilkes, and how long has he known Robbie Williams? Read on below for everything you need to know about the Soccer Aid co-founder. Who is Jonathan Wilkes? Jonathan, 45, is a TV presenter, actor and composer who presented Stars In Their Eyes and co-founded Soccer Aid with Robbie in 2006. Before finding fame as an actor and presenter, Jonathan could have been a professional footballer, having signed for Port Vale FC aged seven and played for Everton FC as a teenager. However, he was not offered a professional contract by either of those clubs due to his apparent lack of desire to 'eat, sleep and breathe football'. Aside from acting and presenting, Jonathan also had success in the charts - after his single Just Another Day reached number 24 in the UK back in 2001. Despite its success upon release, the track was viewed as a failure by Virgin Records, who were expecting a Top 10 hit to materialise. How long has Jonathan Wilkes known Robbie Williams? Explaining their friendship, Jonathan revealed that he and Robbie grew up in the same area and have been friends since they were children. Speaking to Staffordshire Life in 2013, he said: 'I'm proud to death of him - he's been my best mate all my life. Our mums are best mates and we grew up together doing ''am dram''. He added the pair were also housemates when Jonathan first moved to London. 'I was 20, and in my third season at Blackpool, when a chap called Kevin Bishop approached me. 'He ran the Royal Variety shows for the BBC and he was looking for a young presenter for the BBC Choice channel - now BBC3. He asked me to do it,' Jonny recalled. 'I wanted to move on and so said \"yes\" to the move to London. My mate, Rob, said ''Come and live with me in my big mansion'''. 'So, off I went to live with Robbie Williams in London and start my first TV job. That's where I met my wife, Nikki - at the BBC. 'I started to write records as well, and managed to get a record deal with Virgin and got paid very well!' he said. The pair remain close friends to this day, with Jonathan remarking that the duo take no time in picking up where they left off if they go a lengthy period of time without seeing one another. Speaking to The Mirror, he said: 'It does not matter if we have not spoken for months and months, we just go back to the old routine.' How many times has Jonathan Wilkes played in Soccer Aid? As of the 2023 edition of Soccer Aid, Jonathan is tied fifth for the most appearances at the event with six. Last year's game which was hosted at Manchester United's home stadium of Old Trafford, was the the most successful game on record, raising a record-breaking \u00a314.6million. Other notable celebrities to feature include singer and actor Bobby Brazier, Danny Dyer, Paddy McGuinness, Martin Compston, as well as comedians Maisie Adams, Lee Mack and Jason Manford. Robbie - who has appeared in four Soccer Aid matches himself - will co-manage the England side in their quest for victory against the opposition World XI. Does Jonathan Wilkes have a wife and children? Jonathan met his wife Nikki Wheeler in 1999 while working for the BBC. While working for BBC Choice (now BBC Three) Jonathan presented an interview show featuring his wife-to-be, who was part of the girl band Toutes les Filles. After entering into a relationship with one another, the pair tied the knot in 2004, marrying at a ceremony in Los Angeles. The pair have two sons: Mickey, who was born in 2006 and Ralph, who the couple welcomed to the world in 2017.

Mull\u2019s Daughter, TV writer and comic artist Maggie Mull, said her father died at home on Thursday after \u201ca valiant fight against a long illness.\u201d Mull, who was also a guitarist and painter, came to national fame with a recurring role on the Norman Lear-created satirical soap opera \u201cMary Hartman, Mary Hartman,\u201d and the starring role in its spinoff, \u201cFernwood Tonight,\u201d on which he played Barth Gimble, the host of a satirical talk show. \u201cHe was known for excelling at every creative discipline imaginable and also for doing Red Roof Inn commercials,\u201d Maggie Mull said in an Instagram post. \u201cHe would find that joke funny. He was never not funny. My dad will be deeply missed by his wife and daughter, by his friends and coworkers, by fellow artists and comedians and musicians, and \u2014 the sign of a truly exceptional person \u2014 by many, many dogs.\u201d Known for his blonde hair and well-trimmed mustache, Mull was born in Chicago, raised in Ohio and Connecticut and studied art in Rhode Island and Rome. He combined his music and comedy in hip Hollywood clubs in the 1970s. \u201cIn 1976 I was a guitar player and sit-down comic appearing at the Roxy on the Sunset Strip when Norman Lear walked in and heard me,\u201d Mull told The Associated Press in 1980. \u201cHe cast me as the wife beater on \u2018Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\u2019 Four months later I was spun off on my own show.\u201d In the 1980s he appeared in films including \u201cMr. Mom\u201d and \u201cClue,\u201d and in the 1990s had a recurring role on \u201cRoseanne.\u201d He would later play private eye Gene Parmesan on \u201cArrested Development,\u201d and would be nominated for an Emmy in 2016 for a guest turn on \u201cVeep.\u201d Other comedians and actors were often his biggest fans. \u201cMartin was the greatest,\u201d \u201cBridesmaids\u201d director Paul Feig said in an X post. \u201cSo funny, so talented, such a nice guy. Was lucky enough to act with him on The Jackie Thomas Show and treasured every moment being with a legend. Fernwood Tonight was so influential in my life.\u201d", "summary": "Martin Mull, whose droll, esoteric comedy and acting made him a hip sensation in the 1970s and later a beloved guest star on sitcoms including \"Roseanne\" and \"Arrested Development,\" has died, his daughter said Friday.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/28/martin-mull-hip-comic-and-actor-from-fernwood-tonight-and-roseanne-dies-at-80/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24181015861732.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:28:24", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.141}

Carini abandoned the match citing severe nose injury, which subsequently incited heated debates on Khelif's previous disqualification.\n\nMany reactions highlighted the Algerian boxer should not have been allowed to compete at the Olympics following getting barred from the 2023 boxing world championships. It is suggested Khelif failed an unspecified gender eligibility test from the International Boxing Association (IBA). The result showed the 25-year-old boxer with elevated levels of testosterone.\n\nOn the other hand, boxing officials are backing Khelif emphasizing the result of the tests weren't transparent and that IBA has since been suspended from being a part of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) over corruption allegations. In an official statement, the IOC has reaffirmed there wasn't any problem with the Algerian boxer's participation. \"Khelif was assigned female at birth and it says so on her passport, which is the International Olympic Committee's threshold for eligibility for boxing,\" said the committee.\n\nThe result of it all has left the 25-year-old to face the wrath of social media and fall victim to intense online bullying. Amid this Khelif is requesting people to refrain from making harsh comments. In an interview with SNTV, affiliated with the Associated Press, Khelif reportedly said in Arabic, \"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects. It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nPreviously, Khelif's father commented on the controversy surrounding his daughter, producing official documents of the boxer being a female since birth, in an interview with Reuters. \"This is our family official document, May 2, 1999, Imane Khelif, female. It is written here you can read it, this document doesn't lie,\" said Amar Khelif.\n\nHe added, \"Having such a daughter is an honor because she is a champion, she honored me and I encourage her and I hope she will get the medal in Paris.\"\n\nKhelif is guaranteed a medal at the Paris Olympics 2024 when she takes on Janjaem Suwannapheng from Thailand in the semi-final.

Why now? Why is this happening now?\n\n'I don't care. What's important Is that I came here with a focus on my goal, which is the Olympics.\n\n'Today I am in the semi-finals. God willing, I will be up to the challenge in the semifinals. And God willing, I will be able to keep it under control and pass these two stages and the semifinals.'\n\nShe said she should face the same protections enjoyed by other athletes at the games.\n\nShe added: 'I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles according to the Olympic charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes because this thing has effects, massive effects.\n\n'It can destroy people. It can kill people's thoughts, spirits, and mind. And it can divide people.\n\n'And because of that I ask them to refrain from bullying. And that's it.'\n\nIn an interview with Associated Press TV, she said she had concerns about the effects on her relations back in Algeria.\n\n'I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope they were not affected deeply. They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal and that would be the best response.'\n\nCarini, who first faced off against Khelif, complained after the match that Khelif's punches were unlike anything she had felt before and thereby drew attention to the speculation over her gender.\n\nCarini later said she regretted her decision and wished to apologise to Khelif for walking out of the ring.\n\nBut the shocking ending to the bout after just 46 seconds triggered a wave of vitriol directed at the Algerian on social media, with many high-profile figures - including former US President Donald Trump and Harry Potter writer J.K. Rowling - falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.\n\nBut it was the Algerian (left) who was reduced to tears after her last fight against Hungarian Anna Luca Hamori (right) and shouted from the ring: 'I am a woman,' hitting back at claims she was a man\n\nKhelif came under huge criticism after she beat Angela Carini within 46 seconds last week\n\nIn an interview with Associated Press TV, she said she had concerns about the effects on her relations back in Algeria.

Khelif was declared the winner by the referee following Carini's decision to quit after just 46 seconds.\n\nBut many of the headlines were far from celebratory. With Khelif's victory came a wave of disinformation and heated discussion about the athlete's gender.\n\nOn social media, influential posters ranging from politicians like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and former US President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, to athletes like the American swimmer Riley Gaines and well-known public figures like bestselling \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling shared accusations that Khelif was competing in a women's category despite being a man, and that Thursday's bout had been an unfair matchup.\n\nSeveral media outlets like the UK's Daily Mail Online or India's Times Algebra also shared posts with the claim that Khelif was either transgender or a biological man.\n\nDespite there being no proof that Khelif is a transgender boxer, heated debates on social media are still ongoing. A look at the numbers and search terms on Google Trends regarding Imane Khelif reveals that the top search terms still include \"disorders of sex development,\" \"XY chromosome\" and \"Imane Khelif gender test.\"\n\nLooking at the comments left by users under posts by media outlets about Khelif's upcoming matches also reveal the extent of hate speech and disinformation being spread about the boxer.\n\nThe hashtag #IStandWithAngelaCarini has mainly been used to push the narrative that the Italian boxer was at a disadvantage because she had allegedly been forced to fight a man. But it hasn't just been those attacking Khelif who have been active on social media, with her supporters using the hashtag #IStandWithImaneKhelif.\n\nSeveral users trawled the internet to dig up photos providing \"evidence\" of Khelif's femininity -- sharing childhood photos, official documents and interviews with her family members.\n\n\"My child is a girl. She was raised as a girl,\" said her father Omar Khelif in a short video clip posted to YouTube by Sky News. \"She's a strong girl. I raised her to be hard-working and brave. She has a strong will to work and to train.\"\n\nOfficials from various sporting bodies have also come to Khelif's defense, sharing information in an attempt to clear the doubts about her gender.\n\nThe Algerian Olympic and Sports Committee was one of the first to strongly condemn the allegations. In a statement issued on the day of her first fight, the committee said, \"Such attacks are entirely unethical and baseless, especially as she prepares for the pinnacle event of her athletic career -- the Olympic Games.\"\n\nIn a post on Facebook, it added that it had filed an official complaint with the International Olympic Committee to address the online harassment of Khelif.\n\nAt a press conference on August 3, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said the \"hate speech\" directed at boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, a Taiwanese boxer facing similar allegations, at the Paris Olympics was \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\n\"How can somebody being born, raised, competed and having a passport not be considered a woman?\" he said. \"We will not take part in a politically motivated cultural war.\"\n\nBut even these official statements have not ended the debate surrounding Khelif's gender, with many pointing to the fact that Khelif was disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) in 2023. In a press conference on August 5, the IBA specified that both Khelif and Lin had been ruled ineligible after a sex chromosome test.\n\nAt the time, IBA President Umar Kremlev told Russian state news agency TASS that DNA test results showed that several athletes had XY chromosomes. Traditionally, XX chromosomes stand for female and XY chromosomes for male, but science has shown it's not as simple as that.\n\nThe IOC has stated that the gender tests conducted by the IBA were illegitimate and lacked credibility. On August 1, the Olympics governing body said it stands by the athletes and their eligibility to compete. The committee has long criticized the IBA and banned the Russian-run organization in 2019.\n\nWhile Khelif has not commented on her gender or any test results, the boxer has spoken out about the mental toll this viral debate and hate speech has on athletes. In an interview with SNTV on August 5, Khelif urged the people to \"uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects.\n\n\"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people,\" she added.\n\nKhelif's next fight on Tuesday is against Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand. The winner of the match will compete for a gold medal on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Trends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Trends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chromosome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The winner advances to the women's 66-kilogram finals on Friday night.\n\nKhelif, a two-time Olympian, has already clinched her first Olympic medal, which is also Algeria's first medal in women's boxing.

Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K.

The IBA, which is not recognized by the IOC and has no role in Olympic boxing, stripped Lin (gold) and Khelif (bronze) of their 2023 World Championship medals after the organization claimed they failed gender eligibility tests. The IOC and others have raised concerns about the veracity of those tests.\n\nThomas Bach, president of the IOC, said this week there's never been any doubt that Lin and Khelif are cisgender women and he urged \"really everyone to respect these women, to respect them as women, as human beings.\" The IOC also said the two boxers are victims of an arbitrary decision by the IBA.\n\n\"I know that the Olympic Committee has done me justice, and I am happy with this remedy because it shows the truth,\" Khelif said while also acknowledging the pressure surrounding the ordeal. \"... I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren't affected deeply.\n\n\"They are worried about me.

They didn't do that.\n\n\"We have no documents to prove this. If I was accused of not being a man, in that case I would bring over all the documents and go through all checks to prove that I am a real man. And I'm sitting here and I'm answering all your questions and I'm not scared of anything.\"\n\nKremlev also took aim at the International Olympic Committee and its president, Thomas Bach, for allowing both women to compete in the Paris Olympics, arguing it was failing to bring fairness to the sport of women's boxing.\n\nDuring the conference, speaking in Russian, Kremlev claimed: \"The tests show they were men. We don't verify what they have between their legs. We don't know if they were born like that, or if some changes were made.\n\n\"The second tests confirmed the first tests. If people have doubts, refer to them. They can make their own tests.\"\n\nThis was in reference to two tests the two athletes had undergone, one in India last year and a prior test in Turkey in May 2022 that 'concluded the boxer's DNA was that of a male consisting of XY chromosomes,' according to IBA correspondence sent to the International Olympic Committee in June 2023.\n\nHowever, Khelif has called on the rhetoric around the gender row to change and called on people to stop their bullying.\n\nSpeaking in Arabic to SNTV on August 4, Khelif said: \"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects.\n\n\"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind.

The winner advances to the women's 66-kilogram finals on Friday night.\n\nKhelif, a two-time Olympian, has already clinched her first Olympic medal, which is also Algeria's first medal in women's boxing. She needs two more victories to claim only Algeria's second boxing gold medal, following Hocine Soltani in 1996.\n\nKhelif comfortably won her first two fights in Paris, but the ending of her first bout propelled her into a worldwide divide over gender identity and regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.\n\nIn an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nThe IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, have repeatedly defended the Olympic eligibility of Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified by the International Boxing Association in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition. The IBA has been banished from the Olympics since before the Tokyo Games, and the body struggled to articulate the reasoning for its decisions on Khelif and Lin at a news conference Monday.\n\nLin also has clinched a medal and advanced to the Olympic semifinals. She fights Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey in the first bout Wednesday night at Roland Garros.\n\nOlympic boxing does not stage bronze-medal bouts, so the losers of both semifinal bouts receive bronze.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocine_Soltani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hocine Soltani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

And at the time, when Angela withdrew from the match after just 46 seconds when Imane landed a heavy blow, many jumped on social media to wrongly label Imane 'biologically male' or a trans man.\n\nThe rumour was perpetuated by a YouTuber named Logan Paul - and Les Dennis. But now, the British TV personality has realised the error of his ways and quickly apologised for continuing a narrative that was wrong - and fans loved his honesty. He wrote on Twitter (X): \"I apologise for my post re the women's boxing at the Olympics. Sometimes it's easy to get caught up in misinformation. I'll make sure I have the facts before I tweet in future.\"\n\nREAD MORE - Irish Olympic boxing legend Michael Carruth weighs in on Imane Khelif boxing row\n\nREAD MORE - CSO issues apology and deletes graphic praising Ireland's gold medal\n\nJ.K Rowling, however, is yet to retract her multiple statements regarding the match. The Harry Potter author has been slammed by X users thanks to labelling Imane a \"bullying cheat\" for taking to the ring after previously failing a gender eligibility test, despite the athlete being born female.\n\nImane was disqualified from last year's World Boxing Championships in Delhi hours before the final, after failing to meet the gender eligibility criteria of the International Boxing Association. However, the governing body did not specify the reason behind why the boxer failed the test - but it stated that she did not have a testosterone exam. Unfortunately, that did not stop the rumour mill doubting her gender.\n\nAnd now, on the back of Les' tweet, many jumped on social media to praise him for taking accountability of spreading misinformation. One person said: \"Props for admitting you were wrong and setting the record straight. I'd say it's always important to fact check before forming an opinion, as there's so much misinformation, especially during a witch hunt.\"\n\nAnother person added: \"It's astounding that a simple apology and admission you got it wrong feels so foreign in this space but thank you all the same, wish more people were like you!\" A third person penned: \"Takes guts to say you were wrong, good move.\" Meanwhile a fourth stated: \"It's to your credit that you've apologised.\"\n\nLogan has now also back-tracked on his wrongly opinionated statement on X regarding Imane - which has now been deleted. According to The Independent, Logan posted at the time: \"This is the purest form of evil unfolding right before our eyes. A man was allowed to beat up a woman on a global stage, crushing her life's dream while fighting for her deceased father. This delusion must end.\"\n\nBut now, after being called out by many for wrongly naming Imane transgender, Logan penned: \"Oopsies. I might be guilty of spreading misinformation along with the entirety of this app. Although she's been previously disqualified for failing a 'gender test' and has XY chromosomes, some sources say Imane Khelif was born a biological woman.\"\n\nThe YouTuber added: \"I stand by my sentiment that biological men should not compete against biological women in any sport and if you disagree you're a sick f***.\" Moments after, he posted a poll on X asking his followers: \"Is my opinion that men shouldn't be allowed to compete against women transphobic?\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has since spoken about its decision to allow Imane to take part in the Olympic boxing competition. They said: \"Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process. According to the IBA minutes available on their website this decision was initially taken solely by the IBA secretary general and CEO.\"\n\nThe International Boxing Association was stripped of its recognition by the Olympic Committee last year regarding governance and financial question marks. The committee claimed the eligibility rules were based on the Tokyo Games and they could not be changed during a competition.\n\nSpeaking about the disqualification of Imane and boxer Lin Yu-ting, it said: \"The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure, especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years.\" It added: \"The IOC is saddened by the abuse that the two athletes are currently receiving. Every person has the right to practise sport without discrimination.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

And at the time, when Angela withdrew from the match after just 46 seconds when Imane landed a heavy blow, many jumped on social media to wrongly label Imane 'biologically male' or a trans man.\n\nThe rumour was perpetuated by a YouTuber named Logan Paul - and Les Dennis. But now, the British TV personality has realised the error of his ways and quickly apologised for continuing a narrative that was wrong - and fans loved his honesty. He wrote on Twitter (X): \"I apologise for my post re the women's boxing at the Olympics. Sometimes it's easy to get caught up in misinformation. I'll make sure I have the facts before I tweet in future.\"\n\nJ.K Rowling, however, is yet to retract her multiple statements regarding the match. The Harry Potter author has been slammed by X users thanks to labelling Imane a \"bullying cheat\" for taking to the ring after previously failing a gender eligibility test, despite the athlete being born female.\n\nImane was disqualified from last year's World Boxing Championships in Delhi hours before the final, after failing to meet the gender eligibility criteria of the International Boxing Association.

Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting failed a questionable gender test administered by the International Boxing Association (IBA) in 2023, but were declared fit for entry by the International Olympic Committee. Both are female and identify as such, yet one of Khelif's opponents has fueled a public outcry that she has an unfair advantage, even spurring claims she is transgender. We asked sport sociologist and former boxer Anne Tj\u00f8nndal to explain what's going on.\n\nWhat's the history of women's Olympic boxing - and what social issues has it faced?\n\nBoxing was one of the last summer Olympic sports to include women athletes, with women's boxing being introduced to the Olympic program for the London 2012 Games. In London, only three of ten weight categories were included for women: 51kg (flyweight), 60kg (lightweight) and 75kg (middleweight). In the same games, ten weight categories were included for male boxers. The marginalization of women's boxing continued throughout the Rio 2016 Games, maintaining three weight categories for women and ten weight categories for men. Things started to change after Rio, with the Tokyo 2020 games including five weight categories for women and eight categories for men. In Paris, men compete in seven weight categories and women in six.\n\nOne of the biggest controversies of women's boxing at the Olympics took place before London 2012, when AIBA (Association Internationale de Boxe Amateur - now the IBA) suggested it be mandatory for women boxers to compete in skirts at the Olympics. The suggestion was met with resistance from women boxers globally, and while the issue remained undecided as late as January 2012, in the spring of 2012 it was finally announced that women boxers would be allowed to choose between competing in a skirt or in shorts.\n\nToday, the most pressing social issues for women's boxing at the Olympics relate to a lack of female representation in coaching and leadership, and a lack of research into the prevalence of harassment and sexual abuse of women in boxing.\n\nWho is Imane Khelif and how did she come to be in the news?\n\nImane Khelif is a women's amateur boxer from Algeria. She won a silver medal in the 2022 World Championship and a gold medal in the 2022 African Championship. In the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games she reached the quarterfinals. Her amateur record stands at 51 fights (39 wins and 9 losses) at the time of writing.\n\nIn recent news, Khelif has become a victim of widespread misinformation and unfounded allegations regarding her gender. She has been falsely accused of being transgender, despite living her entire life as a woman and having a long-standing career in women's boxing. The controversy originated from the IBA's disqualification of Khelif from the 2023 World Championship. The IBA cited her failure to meet gender eligibility tests, but has not specified the nature of these tests, sparking rumors that Khelif is transgender and biologically male.\n\nThe situation escalated after Khelif won her opening Olympic fight in 46 seconds against Italian Angela Carini. This victory led to an increase in social media abuse directed at Khelif. Carini's comment after the fight, claiming she had never been punched so hard before, further fueled the allegations. Although Carini later apologized to Khelif for her behavior, the controversy was exacerbated when the IBA announced that Carini would receive prize money equivalent to that of gold medalists. The Italian Boxing Federation has since stated that it will not accept this money.\n\nWhat is gender testing and where does testosterone testing fit in?\n\nAlmost all sports competitions are organized in sex categories: a women's category and a men's category. The segregation of men and women's competitions is a founding principle of ensuring fairness in elite sports due to the athletic differences between men and women.\n\nGender testing has been used in elite sports competitions since the 1920s, and was initially introduced to ensure that men could not disguise themselves as women to participate in women's sports. Looking at the history of gender testing however, the \"sex-markers\" being tested have changed as medical knowledge has evolved over the decades. Several of the gender tests have since been proven medically inaccurate and ethically flawed.\n\nTestosterone testing is commonly used in gender testing today. Women athletes who have \"too much\" testosterone are sometimes met with a demand for artificial regulation of their testosterone level. Even if their bodies naturally produce more testosterone compared to other women athletes. The demand for artificial regulation of testosterone levels concerns two groups of athletes in particular: transwomen and women with intersex variations (women with difference in sex development or DSD). There is currently no indication to suggest that Khelif or Yu-ting are affected by DSD.\n\nHow much of this has to do with the feud between the IBA and the IOC?\n\nThe International Boxing Association (IBA) was previously the governing body of amateur (Olympic) boxing. But the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped it of its recognition due to persistent concerns over corruption and governance issues. For the Paris Olympics, a unit appointed by the IOC is organizing the boxing competition. For the 2028 Games, a new organization named World Boxing is expected to replace the IBA as the governing body of Olympic boxing.\n\nThe power struggles and tensions between the IBA and the IOC have raised questions about the IBA's motivations in addressing gender eligibility issues in Olympic boxing. Many believe that the IBA is using the situation of Khelif as a strategy to undermine the IOC and garner global support.\n\nHow does gender and power play out in women's boxing?\n\nHistorically, women have been marginalized as athletes, coaches, referees, and leaders in boxing. In most countries, boxing continues to be a male dominated sport, which often contributes to limiting women's opportunities. A pressing issue today is the lack of women's representation in coaching and leadership in women's boxing.\n\nRegarding gender eligibility in elite sports, women from the global south are over-represented in cases where the gender of female athletes is questioned.", "source": {"uri": "interaksyon.philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Interaksyon"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

I just think, no matter how strong or tough, we're both human, we both have two fists.\n\n\"Having come this far, I want to go all the way to the gold medal.\"\n\nKhelif has defended herself amid the whirlwind of controversy that has followed her throughout Paris.\n\nAfter booking her spot in the semi-final she said: \"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects.\n\n\"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people.\n\n\"And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nKhelif's loved ones were left fearing for her mental health after seeing the overwhelming amount of abuse she received online.\n\nShe said: \"I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren't affected deeply.\n\n\"They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.\"\n\nBecause Olympic boxing does not have a bronze medal play-off, Khelif is now guaranteed a medal this summer.\n\nBut she will have to win two more fights to ensure that she walks out of the ring with gold hanging around her neck.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_hall@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Joshua Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "XY sex-determination system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/OQ-OFF-PLATFORM-IMANE.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787078", "eventUri": "eng-9787078", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

When [Khelif] wasn't winning, then everyone was quiet,' the two-time Olympic gold medalist Semenya told English-based website SportsBoom.com.\n\nKhelif (9-5 as a professional) comfortably won her first two fights in Paris, but the ending of her Olympic debut ignited controversy when opponent Angela Carini of Italy tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nPreviously, Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-Ting were disqualified by the International Boxing Association in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition.\n\nThe IBA has been banished from the Olympics since before the Tokyo Games, and the Russian-linked body has struggled to articulate the reasoning for its decisions on Khelif and Lin at a news conference Monday.\n\nImane Khelif of Algeria sits on the ropes after winning her fight against Anna Luca Hamori\n\nCaster Semenya of Team South Africa reacts after the Women's 5000m heats in 2022\n\nRead More The IBA's press conference was shambolic and raised more questions than answers, writes MIKE KEEGAN\n\n'The IOC's policy and constitution should not contradict each other,' Semenya said. 'Sport is for all people and the constitution says no to discrimination. But the minute they allowed women to be disgraced, it confuses us.'\n\n'If sport is for all, then why does the big governing body allow this sort of thing to happen? They should stand their ground and lead by example. It's about quality leadership that safeguards, protects, and respects women.'\n\nKhelif takes on Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand in boxing semifinals on Tuesday night at Roland Garros, Paris' famed tennis complex. The winner advances to the women's 66-kilogram finals on Friday night.\n\nLin, meanwhile, has also clinched a medal and advanced to the Olympic semifinals. She fights Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey in the first bout Wednesday night at Roland Garros.\n\nThe 33-year-old Semenya has faced her own gender battle after being born with differences of sexual development (DSD), leaving her with elevated testosterone, muscle mass and strength.\n\nAccording to World Athletics, she is not permitted to compete in female track events without taking gender hormone treatment to reduce her testosterone level - something she refuses to do, saying it makes her feel ill.\n\n'At the end of the day, I know I am different,' she told BBC in 2023. 'I don't care about the medical terms or what they tell me being born without a uterus or with internal testicles. Those don't make me less of a woman.\n\n'Those are the differences I was born with and I will embrace them. I am not going to be ashamed because I am different. I am different and special and I feel great about it.'\n\nSemenya, who rejects the 'intersex' label, is now primarily focused with protecting athletes in similar positions.\n\n'It comes with why we fight for women's sport,' she told BBC. 'The importance of women's sport is not being taken seriously and we need to take charge of our own bodies. Decide what is right for us. Not another gender deciding what we should look like.\n\n'If we are woman enough or not, it is up to us. We know and believe in what is right, then why must we stop.'\n\nShe was sidelined for 11 months in 2009 because of track-and-field rules about hormone levels. She has spent years in her legal battle against requirements for her to suppress her natural testosterone to compete.\n\nTaiwanese boxer Lin Yu-Ting was disqualified by the International Boxing Association in 2023\n\nCritics of the rules - which were put in place in 2011 and have tightened over the years - have considered naturally high testosterone levels to be a genetic gift, comparing it to a basketball player's height or a swimmer's long arms.\n\n'Nobody was disqualifying Michael Phelps for having particular biological features that allowed him to excel in swimming,' medical anthropologist Danyal Kade Doyle Griffiths, an adjunct professor with the City University of New York, told The Associated Press.\n\nLike Semenya, Khelif was assigned female at birth, and has never identified as anything but a woman.\n\nBaseless claims that she is a man or transgender surfaced after the controversial boxing association with Russian ties said she failed an opaque eligibility test before last year's world boxing championships.\n\nRussian networks amplified the debate, which quickly became a trending topic online. British news outlets, author J.K. Rowling and right-wing politicians like Donald Trump added to the deluge. At its height late last week, X users were posting about the boxer tens of thousands of times per hour, according to an analysis by PeakMetrics, a cyber firm that tracks online narratives.\n\nThe boxing group at the root of the claims - the International Boxing Association - has been permanently barred from the Olympics, has a Russian president who is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and its biggest sponsor is the state energy company Gazprom. Questions also have surfaced about its decision to disqualify Khelif last year after she had beaten a Russian boxer.\n\nRussian state media has trumpeted some of the same false and misleading content. Instead of covering the athletic competitions, much of the coverage of the Olympics has focused on crime, immigration, litter and pollution.\n\nWhitlock claims Khelif, who is a biological female, should not be allowed to fight women\n\nOne article in the state-run Sputnik news service summed it up: 'These Paris ''games'' sure are going swimmingly. Here's an idea. Stop awarding the Olympics to the decadent, rotting west.'\n\nRussia has used propaganda to disparage past Olympics, as it did when the then-Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.\n\nAt the time, it distributed printed material to Olympic officials in Africa and Asia suggesting that non-white athletes would be hunted by racists in the U.S., according to an analysis from Microsoft Threat Intelligence, a unit within the technology company that studies malicious online actors.\n\nRussia also has targeted past Olympic Games with cyberattacks.\n\n'If they cannot participate in or win the Games, then they seek to undercut, defame, and degrade the international competition in the minds of participants, spectators, and global audiences,' analysts at Microsoft concluded.\n\nA message left with the Russian government was not immediately returned on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

There are lessons here for the future that all people who believe in decency and reside on fact-based Earth 1 should heed. Pay close attention.\n\nBy now you know the story. Khelif became a target of the right over a phony gender eligibility controversy at the 2024 Paris Olympics. She's been abused on social media despite the International Olympic Committee stating there's no doubt she's a woman.\n\nRecently, at one of his rallies, Trump jumped into the controversy. He mentioned how Khelif beat Italian boxer Angela Carini.\n\n\"Now all you have to do is look at the boxers,\" Trump said. \"This young girl from Italy, a champion boxer, she got hit so hard she didn't know what the hell hit her.\"\n\n\"It's a person that transitioned,\" Trump said of Khelif. \"He was a good male boxer. And (Carini) didn't even go down. He hit her with two jabs and she said, 'I'm out.'\"\n\nTrump's words about Khelif were so full of lies, former Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban felt compelled to respond. \"... She is from Algeria,\" Cuban posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"In Algeria it is illegal to be gay. The idea they would send a gay or trans Olympian is insane.\"\n\nWhy would Trump weigh in on a boxer he clearly knows nothing about at one of his rallies? The answer is he saw the hatred generated by this contrived situation and joined in for political reasons.\n\nYes, you've heard about the story of Imane Khelif, but there's one part of it you may not fully understand. The extremist and angry reaction aimed at her was orchestrated. It was plotted. Brought to you by the same people and corporations that portrayed Colin Kaepernick as disloyal to America. The same media conglomerate that states, almost every year, that a migrant caravan is coming and will destroy the nation. The same people who say Taylor Swift was part of a weird conspiracy.\n\nThe same people who tried to destroy the Dixie Chicks and Bud Light. And Target. And something something about gas stoves. The same people who said there was a pedophile ring at a pizza parlor. That some nebulous force stole an election. That Barack Obama wasn't a real American and Kamala Harris isn't really Black. That there's a war on Christmas.\n\nUnhinged controversy around Olympic boxer Imane Khelif should never happen again.\n\nThey are all fake issues that at one point caused massive hyperventilation among extremists. They are mushroom clouded by Fox News which is patient zero for disinformation. Emerging from Fox is a system of polluted tributaries, all looking to mine anger for profit.\n\nThat's the main thing here: money. It's a Grifting Industrial Complex. Please remember that.\n\nThis is what happened to Khelif. She was shoved into this rage rewarding algorithmic vortex by an opportunistic grifting meatgrinder. There, facts don't matter. Truth doesn't either. In fact, the more anyone tries to replace the lying with reality, it only hardens the grifting resolve.\n\nThe good news is that these controversies have become so numerous, and so fake, their shelf life is shrinking. The bad news is that to keep the attention of their marks they have to constantly shift from outrage to outrage. So the cycle doesn't really end.\n\nAn even bigger problem is the personal toll these lies can take. They destroy lives and sometimes put people in actual physical harm. The falsities about Khelif led to her publicly pleading for decency.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" Khelif said in an interview with SNTV, according to The Associated Press. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nThe right will move on from Khelif and find something else to hate. Just remember this for the next outrage. Remember the goal. It's to get you to hate someone, or something, who likely did nothing but exist.\n\nThat's all Khelif is guilty of. Just living.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score":

In an interview with SNTV, the 25-year-old Olympian, who represented her nation in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, urged people all over the world to \"uphold the Olympic principles and charter.\" She also appealed \"to refrain from bullying all athletes.\" Khelif further stated that bullying can \"destroy and kill people's thoughts, spirit, and mind and divide people.\"\n\nItalian boxer Angela Carini, who tearfully quit her bout with Imane Khalife apologized to the latter, stating that the whole controversy made her sad \"I felt sorry for my opponent, she had nothing to do with it,\" she added, \"and like me she was only here to fight.\" Carini, who refused to shake hands with Khalife earlier, remarked that, \"If I happened to meet her again I would give her a hug.\"\n\nImane Khelif was raised in the rural heartlands of western Algeria in Tiaret village, where she dabbled in football. Bullied by boys of her age, Khelif dodged their punches, thus getting into boxing. Initially, her own father was against her move, even as she was forced to travel 10 kilometers every week to find a boxing gym. The bus fare for the commute was a big deal for the Khelif family, as she sold scraps and her mum sold couscous to afford the weekly bus ticket for her training sessions.

I'm undecided, so I want to see brilliant medical experts rack their brains in this debate to enlighten me.\n\nThe concept of gender binary is deeply ingrained in our understanding of life. Yet, the complexity of sexual identification can often lead to unexpected discoveries, uncertainties, and severe emotional distress for individuals.\n\nIt's fascinating to consider human beings as a creation, where the old universal rule on sexual assignment has been challenged and has evolved over the years.\n\nI get the sense that God has a cheeky side -- He allowed this to happen and wants to challenge His creations to see how they would solve it peacefully without His help.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics will likely be remembered for the controversies related to gender issues. Those controversies include the highly charged opening ceremony that ridiculed a religious belief and a boxing event that challenged traditional gender roles.\n\nImane Khelif is an Algerian boxer who gained attention for advancing in the women's boxing division. She won the fight against Italian boxer Angela Carini in just 46 seconds of the opening round, reducing Carini to tears. The Italian abandoned the fight, saying it was the first time she felt she had been struck by a \"man.\"\n\nKhelif then advanced to the bronze medal after defeating Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary in the women's division. It was a pyrrhic victory considering the emotional cost in the form of hateful comments, threats, and derogatory remarks she is facing online.\n\nIn the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Khelif competed in women's boxing under the Algerian flag and lost. However, she is now facing allegations of \"cheating\" related to her gender for winning in the Paris Olympics. Understandably, a humane society does not condone violence against women, more so in close contact sports.\n\nWould her gender be questioned if she had lost again?\n\nBased on reports from the Olympics, Khelif has a Difference in Sexual Development (DSD), an abnormality in anatomic sexual development caused by the failure of the sex glands to develop.\n\nThe rare disorder is called \"Swyer syndrome,\" a DSD that causes females to have \"XY\" chromosomes, typically consistent with males, instead of the usual XX chromosomes assigned to females. Of course, being born this way was not Khelif's fault. Still, as a result, she has developed a higher muscle mass consistent with masculine attributes, giving her an undue advantage in mismatched competitions in women's events. Understanding this biological aspect could be as complex as understanding rocket science.\n\nAgainst nonstop online abuse from angry Olympics spectators, who could be at fault here? The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is standing by its rules and has affirmed that Khelif \"was born female, lived as a female, and possessed a female passport.\" This stance has significant implications for the future of gender eligibility in sports.\n\nInterestingly, Khelif was one of two athletes disqualified from last year's world championships in New Delhi, the other being Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting, after they failed to meet the gender eligibility criteria. The International Boxing Association (IBA) guidelines define a woman as an individual with XX chromosomes when determining competing eligibility.\n\nLin, previously found to have XY chromosomes and disqualified by the IBA, beat Svetlana Staneva in the Paris Olympics and is now assured of a medal.\n\nLin did not challenge the IBA disqualification before the Court of Arbitration in Sports (CAS), but Khelif initially did, only to withdraw it later.\n\nAre the two boxers in question male or female? I'm undecided, so I want to see brilliant medical experts rack their brains in this debate to enlighten me.\n\nBe that as it may, I believe the IOC urgently needs to update its rules for gender assignment to ensure politically correct guidelines for participating countries in the Olympics. This can be achieved by relying on objective, independent tests rather than self-identification by individuals -- a crucial step in the evolution of sports.\n\nBy ensuring that countries and athletes are well-informed about opponents with rare medical conditions and that the guidelines are correctly followed, the IOC can avoid another debacle in the next Olympics, a hopeful prospect for the future of sports.\n\nFor feedback, text to 09451450681 or email at cynchdb@gmail.com.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cynthia_d_balana@tribune.net.ph", "name": "Cynthia D.

Two women are accused of being men. The murky evidence amounts to Russian hearsay. Yet despite an untrustworthy source, the Games have been in a frenzy, igniting a culture war that has ruined the experience for two boxers whose abnormal size and power make them the perfect scary villains in a ghost story.\n\nThis is what those fearful of a transgender or intersex invasion in women's sport have been screaming warnings about, right? A male posing as female pummelling a poor victim. It doesn't matter whether Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu Ting truly failed legitimate gender-eligibility tests during the world championships last year. The hint of dishonesty was enough for the gender police to work themselves into a rage after Khelif forced Italian boxer Angela Carini to quit 46 seconds into a fight on Thursday. Before anyone could unpack the truth, complexities and conflicts of interest involved, the story had become a social-media firestorm.\n\nOn Friday, Lin stepped into the ring for a preliminary-round bout and won a unanimous decision over Sitora Turdibekova, of Uzbekistan. It was a depressing sight, seeing a throng of reporters on hand to chase after misinformation, trying to adjudicate a whisper. Between interviews in the mixed zone, I heard a media member talk aloud about Lin's tall, 5ft 9in frame and \"bulging muscles\", the latter of which was ridiculous because she is as lean as a basketball player.\n\n\"See?\" the media member said. \"That looks like a man to me.\"\n\nI walked away. The day had turned into a witch-hunt.\n\nThis all started because the International Boxing Association, an organisation that the International Olympic Committee decertified last year because of serial malfeasance, disqualified Khelif and Lin because they didn't \"meet eligibility rules\" during the 2023 world championships. At the time, IBA president Umar Kremlev told a Russian news agency that the federation had \"proven they have XY chromosomes\".\n\nBut three days before the disqualifications, Khelif had defeated a Russian boxer, Azalia Amineva, during the competition in New Delhi. The IBA, led by a Russian president, is as suspicious a source as it gets. When the IOC decided to cut ties with the boxing federation in June 2023, members approved the decision with a 69-1 vote. Allegations of bribes, match-fixing and election manipulation plague the IBA. The IOC now oversees boxing during the Olympics.\n\nOn Friday, IOC spokesman Mark Adams made a plea for the madness to stop.\n\n\"What I would urge is that we try to take the culture war out of this and actually address the issues and think about the individuals and the people concerned,\" Adams said. \"Real damage is being done by misinformation.\"\n\nWhen scrutinised, the IBA's accusation is rickety. The organisation has yet to clarify what type of test it administered to the boxers. In a statement this week, it said the women weren't given a testosterone examination. It referred to it as \"a separate and recognised test\", but declared the results confidential.\n\nHistory has taught us to trust the IOC at our own peril, but it is a beacon of truth compared with the IBA. Although its answers also weren't specific, the IOC made a passionate defence of the boxers' right to compete.\n\nAdams addressed Khelif the morning after discussion of her fight went viral.\n\n\"The Algerian boxer was born female, was registered female, lived her life as a female, boxed as a female and has a female passport,\" Adams said. \"This is not a transgender case. There has been some confusion that this is a man fighting a woman. This is just not the case. On that, there is consensus. Scientifically, this is not a man fighting a woman.\"\n\nLater, he continued: \"Are these athletes women? Yes, according to eligibility, according to their passports, according to their history.\"\n\nBut in a society struggling to accept gender pluralism -- let alone contemplate how to include athletes who don't fit into our tidy male-female sports structure -- it doesn't take much to make people panic. When Khelif made quick work of Carini, the disingenuous were ready to pounce. The usual instigators chimed in: Donald Trump, Elon Musk, author J.K. Rowling. The boxers' gender identity wasn't as important to them as their appearance. If it simply looks unfair, that's plenty effective.\n\nSuch a thought is chilling because, in the United States and throughout our supposedly sophisticated world, there is an embrace of potentially abusive policies that allow the gender of athletes to be challenged on mere assumption. In sport, extraordinary physical traits have been always considered a blessing, but what happens when others are permitted to discriminate openly against young girls and women who have done nothing wrong except have the nerve to be dominant?\n\nFor those who think transphobia is a myth, look at this latest boxing scandal of wicked imagination, where trans hate now extends to boxers who aren't even trans. Evidently, it's time to protect women's boxers from ... well, getting hit?\n\n\"All this controversy makes me sad,\" Carini told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, according to BBC.\n\nMany speculated Carini stopped fighting to protest Khelif. They took her decision not to shake hands with Khelif as evidence of disgust. When Carini spoke for herself, the real story was nothing like the pot-stirrers theorised.\n\n\"It wasn't something I intended to do,\" Carini said of not shaking hands. \"Actually, I want to apologise to her and everyone else. I was angry because my Olympics had gone up in smoke.\"\n\nIf Carini gets to share space with Khelif again, she already knows how she would react. She would \"embrace her\".\n\nYet some people want to protect this woman from another woman. It would be better if they ended the paternalistic charade and listened to Carini. Her moral compass is way more reliable.", "source": {"uri": "royalgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Royal Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Culture war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intersex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Match fixing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chromosome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Algerian has already assured herself of a medal.\n\nOnir on Imane Khelif controversy\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with The Free Press Journal, Onir lauded Khelif's courage and focused on the importance of standing up for individual rights in sports.\n\nSharing his thoughts about the ongoing controversy, he said, \"I feel that people are extremely narrow-minded in their thinking of what is masculinity and femininity. It's really sad that someone who is born as a woman, identifying her entire life as a woman, and has been playing in women's sports and has come through valid means, was attacked and shamed the way she was.\"\n\nDutee Chand's struggle\n\nHe also highlighted a similar story of Dutee Chand, India's first openly-gay athlete and the country's fastest sprinter, who had to give gender tests and was banned in 2023 for 4 years after failing a dope test.\n\n\"It has happened before also, the same kind of shaming of Dutee Chand, and today we celebrate her. I feel it is the insecurity, not only because of that but also her being a coloured woman. You see this kind of thing happening much more in people of colour involved, be it Chand or her, and it is rather unfortunate, but I'm glad that the Olympics took a stand and said that she deserves to be where she is. She is a brave woman, and the way she's won the next round just shows that. Hats off to her courage and conviction.\"\n\nAll About Imane Khelif\n\nAlgerian professional boxer Imane Khelif in 2020 represented her country at the Tokyo Olympics and is currently competing in Paris. She made it to the finals of the IBA Women's World Boxing Championships in March 2023 but was later disqualified after failing to meet the eligibility criteria set by the International Boxing Association (IBA).\n\nThis year, she grabbed the headlines after winning the first round of the women's 66kg category, defeating Angela Carini of Italy who abandoned the fight after just 46 seconds in the ring.\n\nNetizens and international celebrities like Elon Musk and JK Rowling slammed the IOC for letting a \"biologically male boxer\" fight against females at the Games.\n\nOnir believes stories such as that of Khelif and Dutee will bring out a massive change in society and bring out acceptance and respect for the gay community.\n\nOnir is set to attend the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) 2024, alongside other esteemed directors Kabir Khan, Imtiaz Ali and Rima Das for the premier of their film 'My Melbourne' on August 15.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manisha_karki@freepressjournal.in", "name": "Manisha Karki", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onir", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutee_Chand", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dutee Chand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Press_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Free Press Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femininity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Femininity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masculinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabir_Khan_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kabir Khan (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Congratulations to this young woman.\"\n\nOn August 3, Khelif secured a commanding 5-0 victory against Hungary's Hamor Anna Luca in the women's 66kg quarterfinal.\n\nHari, a renowned kickboxer and former mixed martial artist, is often regarded as one of the greatest kickboxers in history. He has held the titles of K-1 Heavyweight World Champion (2007-2008) and It's Showtime Heavyweight World Champion (2009-2010).\n\nKhelif, a seasoned competitor in women's boxing, boasts an impressive resume. She competed in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and secured a silver medal at the 2022 Women's World Championships in Istanbul.\n\nDespite her accolades, her participation in the Paris Games has been clouded by allegations related to her gender.\n\nThe controversy arose particularly after her decisive victory over Italy's Angela Carini in a welterweight bout. Misinformation and unfounded claims about Khelif being transgender due to the sheer force of her punches have sparked heated debate.\n\nRead Also: Morocco's Soufiane El Bakkali Wins First Place in Olympic 3000m Steeplechase Qualifier\n\nThe controversy has led to an undue examination of Khelif's background, with many bringing to the conversation that the boxer has a high level of testosterone for a woman.\n\nSupporters have rallied on social media, defending Khelif and debunking the claims of her being transgender. Medical science and her extensive public boxing career lend credence to the argument that these allegations are unfounded.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, experts have defended the validity of Khelif's gender testing and debunked myths about the role of testosterone in unfair advantages for women in sports.\n\nIn an interview with the Economic Times, Payoshnii Mitra, athlete rights advocate and executive director of Humans of Sport organization said: \"It's important to understand that the level of testosterone in all these women is produced naturally.\" She continued, \"Even if one has a high level of testosterone, a woman's tissues and muscles may not respond\" in the same way (as men's).\n\nIn a recent interview with BFMTV, Khelif's father also defended his daughter, stating, \"My child is a girl. She was raised as a girl. She's a strong girl. I raised her to be hardworking and brave. She has a strong will to work and to train. The Italian opponent she faced was unable to defeat my daughter because my daughter was stronger and she was softer.\"\n\nBoth the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU) have emphasized in a statement that all athletes must comply with eligibility and medical regulations, with gender verification based on official passport information.\n\nThey have also criticized the International Boxing Association (IBA) for its sudden disqualification of Khelif and Taiwan's Lin-Yu during the 2023 World Championships, which contributed to the current controversy.\n\nPushing through the controversy, the Algerian boxer is still competing in the ring. Khelif is scheduled to compete against Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng today in a semifinal match at 9:34 p.m. Moroccan time.\n\n\u00a9 Morocco World News. All Rights Reserved.

It's important to note that the title change had nothing to do with Paul's tweet, but WWE wants no part in that narrative.\n\nAt the 2024 Olympic Games, Algeria's Imane Khelif secured a quick victory over Italy's Angela Carini, who quit the match after just 46 seconds. Footage of Carini crying after the bout has gone viral, leading to controversy and scrutiny over Khelif's eligibility due to her gender. Khelif's presence at the Paris Olympics has been controversial, particularly following her disqualification from the 2023 World Championships due to an unspecified gender eligibility test.\n\nIn the match, Carini and Khelif exchanged only a few punches before Carini walked away, which is unusual in Olympic boxing. Carini's headgear was dislodged multiple times before she ended the bout. Following the fight, Carini did not shake Khelif's hand and was seen crying in the ring.\n\nLogan Paul didn't mince words when discussing the boxing match controversy, speaking out against the \"purest form of evil\" that the world saw at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. He then doubled down on those comments in bold fashion.\n\n\"This is the purest form of evil unfolding right before your eyes. A biological man was allowed to beat up a woman on a global stage, crushing her life's dream while fighting for her deceased father. This delusion must end\"\n\nSean Ross Sapp reported on Fightful Select that in regards to Logan Paul and his comments on Imane Khelif, things have been quiet on that front outside of the outlet being told that his views do not reflect that of WWE.\n\n\"Things have been quiet on that front outside of us being told that his views do not reflect that of WWE.\"\n\nThis was quite a controversy that erupted on social media. Only time will tell what the next controversy will be, but Val Venis shared his open support for Logan Paul and Jake Paul as the two brothers from Cleveland took a stand against Imane Khelif at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nWhat's your take on Imane Khelif's performance at the Olympic Games?

While it remains unclear what standards the Algerian Olympian failed to meet, she faced no such hurdles when qualifying for this year's summer Olympics -- and went on to win a gold medal after her opponent, Italian boxer Angela Carini, forfeited their match seconds in after getting a bloody nose.\n\nBecause of that former disqualification, however, Paul and his fellow bigots raised a huge stink, suggesting that Khelif is a \"biological male\" -- as per the common line of reasoning used against transgender women, particularly those who compete in women's sports -- who, by bloodying Carini's nose and winning gold, had perpetrated misogynist violence.\n\n\"This is the purest form of evil,\" Paul said in his initial, since-deleted tweet.\n\nThe entire situation is a travesty and an embarrassing vestige of Cold War-era \"gender testing\" in global sports competition enacted out of fear that Eastern European countries were sending men to compete in women's sports -- and reveals, accidentally, just how myopic the transphobic worldview really is.\n\n\"OOPSIES,\" Paul declared in his half-hearted apology tweet, posted on Musk's X-formerly-Twitter social network. \"I might be guilty of spreading misinformation along with the entirety of this app.\"\n\n\"Although she's been previously disqualified for failing a 'gender test' and has XY chromosomes,\" he continued, \"some sources say Imane Khelif was born a biological woman.\"\n\n\"I stand by my sentiment that biological men should not compete against biological women in any sport,\" Paul wrote, \"and if you disagree you're a sick fuck.\"\n\nWhile it's rare that someone as prominent as Paul will so readily admit to \"spreading misinformation,\" the rest of his backhanded apology serves as a reminder of the root cause of this entire manufactured controversy: that beyond just wanting to demean and punish trans women for having the audacity to exist, they also are so deeply invested in rigid gender roles that they end up applying the same perverted standards to cis women as well.\n\nFrom the absolute freaks who follow butch cis women into bathrooms to confront them over their gender identity to the armed protesters who threaten drag queen story time, it's clear that misinformation like that which Paul admitted to has whipped transphobes into such a frenzy that they've entirely lost the plot -- which is, at the end of the day, indicative of just how unhinged their beliefs really are.", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cisgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Sometimes it's easy to get caught up in misinformation,' his post read.\n\n'I'll make sure I have the facts before I tweet in future.'\n\nHis apology was welcomed by many after the initial backlash.\n\n'Didn't see it Les, but if everyone on here had the balls to apologise and admit an error when they have posted misinformation we would be where we are...fair play,' user Clifford commented.\n\n'If more people apologised the world would be a better place,' Mike shared.\n\n'Unprecedented. Someone apologising for spreading misinformation on X. Well played, Les, takes a certain strength of character to do this,' Sam added.\n\nHowever, some were still frustrated by his initial actions.\n\n'You're old enough to know better. It's truly embarrassing that you did no ounce of research before spreading hatred and misinformation,' Zack wrote.\n\nLast year the IBA said Imane and another boxer Lin Yu-ting did not meet the 'required eligibility criteria' for the female category, later claiming the pair were found to have XY chromosomes.\n\nHowever, the IOC has accused the IBA of disqualifying the pair based on an 'arbitrary decision' with 'no due process', suggesting no scientific tests were carried out as part of the decision.\n\nThe IOC has slammed the 'current aggression' being directed at the two athletes, adding it was 'saddened by the abuse they are currently receiving'.\n\n'Every person has the right to practise sport without discrimination,' it added.\n\nImane does not identify as either transgender or intersex.\n\nShe is scheduled to continue her Olympian campaign in Paris with a fight today, with a win guaranteeing her a bronze medal.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page -

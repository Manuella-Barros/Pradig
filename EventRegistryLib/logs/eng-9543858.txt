It's time to pretty much wish them well, with just about the entire team -- players such as Kelly Oubre Jr., Kyle Lowry and Nic Batum -- ending the season with an expired contract.\n\nTeam president Daryl Morey this summer has about $65 million in salary cap space, a first-round draft pick, a max contract to offer to Maxey and plenty of questions to solve on how to finally, truly build an NBA championship contender around Embiid.\n\n\"We're not going to have continuity,\" Morey said Monday at the 76ers' headquarters in New Jersey. \"We'll have continuity with our stars and our head coach but we're going to have a lot of changes this season.\"\n\nThe Sixers first-round exit against the Knicks made it 41 years since their last NBA championship. The Sixers haven't even advanced out of the second round since 2001. It's time to start over -- this time with a championship chase, not a Process.\n\n\"We're focused on Joel and Tyrese and we're focused on now,\" Morey said.\n\nFREE AGENCY\n\nThe 76ers have money to spend. But will they aim high for an aging player such as Paul George? What about a wild-card play at LeBron James?\n\nJames and George would have to decline player options to hit the market. Nurse won a championship in Toronto with Pascal Siakam and was an assistant coach with the Raptors when DeMar DeRozan was on the team. Both players are free agents and could be a nice fit in Philly.\n\n\"You have to factor in the age,\" Morey said. \"We feel like we're in the window where we have to win now. We're mostly focused on getting the best players that fit with Joel and Tyrese.\"\n\nTHE NEED FOR EMBIID\n\nEmbiid will be an old 30 next season and expecting the All-Star center to miss a significant chunk of playing time because of injuries is an unfortunate rite of the season for the Sixers.\n\nEmbiid has never played more than 68 games in a season and was limited to only 39 this season in large part because of knee surgery. The 76ers finished 31-8 in the regular season with Embiid -- about a 65-win pace -- and a woeful 16-27 without him.\n\n\"I feel like I could have done a better job with the players so that we were in a better spot to win without him,\" Morey said. \"That said, we do spend 90% of the time figuring out how to win the title with him. It can't be a big focus, how we play without him. We know that team can't win a championship. It's really, how do we manage through it better? I felt like, on me, the depth wasn't quite there when he was out to win at the level we wanted to win at.\"\n\nWhile the Sixers and their fans might wish Embiid would take a summer off to rest up, he is set to play for USA Basketball at the Paris Olympics. The 76ers won't stand in Embiid's way.\n\n\"It's a dream of his to represent the United State in the Olympics,\" Morey said. \"I think it's important to support the dreams of your best player.\"\n\nDRAFT SUCCESS\n\nWith the Sixers in win-now mode, a string of solid seasons usually has them drafting toward the mid to late first round. Maxey in 2020 was the last draft pick who made any kind of impact. The 76ers are scheduled to pick 16th overall and hold the 41st overall pick in the second round. While the draft quality has been knocked for having little depth, Morey said he's fine with staying at 16.\n\nWell, if he stays at 16.\n\n\"We don't really focus on the draft for help now,\" Morey said. \"I do really love 16. The storylines have been that the draft is worse. I don't see that at all. I'm very excited at who's at 16. That said, as you might expect, we have all options on the table. Trade into the future so we keep more picks available for future trades.\"\n\nMAX-EY CONTRACT\n\nMaxey's career skyrocketed this season with his first All-Star berth, the NBA's Most Improved Player award, and a season-extending 46-point effort in a Game 5 win in New York.\n\n\"We should all learn not to bet against Tyrese,\" Morey said.\n\nHe is a restricted free agent, meaning the 76ers could match any offer extended to the personable guard. Maxey is eligible to get a five-year, $205 million contract.\n\n\"A year ago, if we had polled everyone in the media or the GMs, it wouldn't have been unanimous that Tyrese could take that step forward that we hoped he could,\" Morey said.\n\nFINAL WORD\n\n\"This offseason's a big one,\" Morey said. \"I owe it to the fans, to ownership, to everybody, to get this team in a place where we're competing for championships.

While the draft quality has been knocked for having little depth, Morey said he's fine with staying at 16.\n\nWell, if he stays at 16.\n\n\"We don't really focus on the draft for help now,\" Morey said. \"I do really love 16.

It's time to start over -- this time with a championship chase, not a Process.\n\n\"We're focused on Joel and Tyrese and we're focused on now,\" Morey said.\n\nFREE AGENCY\n\nThe 76ers have money to spend. But will they aim high for an aging player such as Paul George? What about a wild-card play at LeBron James?\n\nJames and George would have to decline player options to hit the market. Nurse won a championship in Toronto with Pascal Siakam and was an assistant coach with the Raptors when DeMar DeRozan was on the team. Both players are free agents and could be a nice fit in Philly.\n\n\"You have to factor in the age,\" Morey said. \"We feel like we're in the window where we have to win now. We're mostly focused on getting the best players that fit with Joel and Tyrese.\"\n\nTHE NEED FOR EMBIID\n\nEmbiid will be an old 30 next season and expecting the All-Star center to miss a significant chunk of playing time because of injuries is an unfortunate rite of the season for the Sixers.\n\nEmbiid has never played more than 68 games in a season and was limited to only 39 this season in large part because of knee surgery. The 76ers finished 31-8 in the regular season with Embiid -- about a 65-win pace -- and a woeful 16-27 without him.\n\n\"I feel like I could have done a better job with the players so that we were in a better spot to win without him,\" Morey said. \"That said, we do spend 90% of the time figuring out how to win the title with him. It can't be a big focus, how we play without him. We know that team can't win a championship. It's really, how do we manage through it better? I felt like, on me, the depth wasn't quite there when he was out to win at the level we wanted to win at.\"\n\nWhile the Sixers and their fans might wish Embiid would take a summer off to rest up, he is set to play for USA Basketball at the Paris Olympics. The 76ers won't stand in Embiid's way.\n\n\"It's a dream of his to represent the United State in the Olympics,\" Morey said. \"I think it's important to support the dreams of your best player.\"\n\nDRAFT SUCCESS\n\nWith the Sixers in win-now mode, a string of solid seasons usually has them drafting toward the mid to late first round. Maxey in 2020 was the last draft pick who made any kind of impact. The 76ers are scheduled to pick 16th overall and hold the 41st overall pick in the second round. While the draft quality has been knocked for having little depth, Morey said he's fine with staying at 16.\n\nWell, if he stays at 16.\n\n\"We don't really focus on the draft for help now,\" Morey said. \"I do really love 16. The storylines have been that the draft is worse. I don't see that at all. I'm very excited at who's at 16. That said, as you might expect, we have all options on the table. Trade into the future so we keep more picks available for future trades.\"\n\nMAX-EY CONTRACT\n\nMaxey's career skyrocketed this season with his first All-Star berth, the NBA's Most Improved Player award, and a season-extending 46-point effort in a Game 5 win in New York.\n\n\"We should all learn not to bet against Tyrese,\" Morey said.\n\nHe is a restricted free agent, meaning the 76ers could match any offer extended to the personable guard. Maxey is eligible to get a five-year, $205 million contract.\n\n\"A year ago, if we had polled everyone in the media or the GMs, it wouldn't have been unanimous that Tyrese could take that step forward that we hoped he could,\" Morey said.\n\nFINAL WORD\n\n\"This offseason's a big one,\" Morey said. \"I owe it to the fans, to ownership, to everybody, to get this team in a place where we're competing for championships. We obviously didn't achieve it this year.\"\n\nTags Sports Basketball Games And Toys The Economy Law Job Market Can't get enough High School sports?

The challenge is to add another star, though Monday was not the time to name names, and surround him with players like Kelly Oubre and Kyle Lowry, both free agents. With Morey it's quality, not quantity.\n\n\"Generally, historically, having top players works better,\" Morey said. \"I know recently just to talk about storylines everyone's like, 'Oh, you know, it's the teams with depth that win.' You go back a little bit, and recent teams have won without much depth like the Lakers. You have teams without continuity that have won recently. We'll have continuity with our stars and our head coach, but we're going to have a lot of change this offseason. So, it's good that there are teams like the Lakers, like Toronto, like the Milwaukee Bucks who made big changes the year they won the title. They didn't have a ton of continuity those years.\n\n\"So, long story short, there isn't like a formula. Everyone wants to find a pattern, and there isn't one. The pattern is to have really good players and have them be better than all the teams you play.\"\n\nMorey fielded questions for 30 minutes at the Sixers training facility in Camden. Drove you crazy with the water bottle act, holding it like a prop and screwing and unscrewing the top often without taking a sip.\n\nThere was no question that Morey feels good about moving the Sixers forward despite a disappointing first-round playoff exit in six games to the Knicks, who have one certified star in Jalen Brunson.\n\nAt the top of Morey's shopping list is a legit wingman for Embiid and Maxey.\n\n\"Someone at the wing who can play and deliver at a high level in the playoffs,\" Morey said. \"That's the biggest need.\"\n\nThat indicates free agent Tobias Harris will be shown the door, although Morey said there is interest in retaining all of the team's free agents.\n\nPaul George fits that criterion, and there are reports the Sixers and Orlando covet him. The Sixers are closer to a title than the Magic, who took a big step forward but are another year away.\n\nThe drawing power of Embiid and Maxey could help recruit George or talents like LeBron James and Jimmy Butler.\n\nJust so you know, Morey says age isn't a part of any mythical formula to win a championship. George is almost 34. Butler will be 35 next season, James 40.\n\n\"If anything, the direction of the arrow and age has been that it's less of an impact than it has been in the past,\" Morey said. \"We have a lot of tools this offseason. More than most teams in our situation. More draft picks, more cap space and two great players but that story is yet to be written. We'll have to see how the offseason goes and how we play. If (star players) can play basketball and they can fit with Joel and Tyrese, then we want them here.\"\n\nMorey explained that the Sixers are basically committed to only Embiid, Maxey, who is a restricted free agent, Paul Reed and Ricky Council IV.\n\n\"We're mostly going to be a veteran laden team,\" Morey said. \"There's going to be a lot of change. Except for Nick Nurse, Joel and Tyrese, and Paul and Ricky, we don't know for sure who's going to be back next year. We'll have continuity with our stars and our head coach but we're going to have a lot of change this offseason. We feel like we're in the window where we have to win now. We're mostly focused on getting the best players that fit in with Joel and Tyrese.\"\n\nIn terms of Embiid's health, there are ongoing discussions of how to enhance the big guy's conditioning. Embiid is often hurt late in seasons when his team needs him most.\n\nWhether or not he plays in the Paris Olympics for Team USA is Embiid's decision, according to Morey. By then the Sixers should be better after free agency and the draft.\n\n\"Obviously, we didn't meet our goals this year,\" Morey said. \"That said, man, this place is buzzing. Everyone is in and excited to attack this offseason. Obviously, we have two great studs to build around in Joel and Tyrese. Tyrese took a big leap forward this year. We think the sky is the limit for him. Joel was incredible for us, a warrior for us to the end. So, we're excited in who we're building around.\n\n\"This offseason is a big one. I owe it to the fans, to ownership, to everybody to get this team in a place where we're competing for championships, and we obviously didn't achieve that this year.\"", "source": {"uri": "mcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Morning Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_grotz@mcall.com", "name": "Bob Grotz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Morey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Oubre_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Oubre Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobias Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Reed_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Reed (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24040790781406.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543858", "eventUri": "eng-9543858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

It's time to pretty much wish them well, with just about the entire team - players such as Kelly Oubre Jr., Kyle Lowry and Nic Batum - ending the season with an expired contract.\n\nTeam president Daryl Morey this summer has about $65 million in salary cap space, a first-round draft pick, a max contract to offer to Maxey and plenty of questions to solve on how to finally, truly build an NBA championship contender around Embiid.\n\n\"We're not going to have continuity,\" Morey said Monday at the 76ers' headquarters in New Jersey. \"We'll have continuity with our stars and our head coach but we're going to have a lot of changes this season.\"\n\nThe Sixers first-round exit against the Knicks made it 41 years since their last NBA championship.

We're mostly focused on getting the best players that fit with Joel and Tyrese.\"\n\nEmbiid will be an old 30 next season and expecting the All-Star center to miss a significant chunk of playing time because of injuries is an unfortunate rite of the season for the Sixers.\n\nEmbiid has never played more than 68 games in a season and was limited to only 39 this season in large part because of knee surgery. The 76ers finished 31-8 in the regular season with Embiid - about a 65-win pace - and a woeful 16-27 without him.\n\n\"I feel like I could have done a better job with the players so that we were in a better spot to win without him,\" Morey said. \"That said, we do spend 90% of the time figuring out how to win the title with him. It can't be a big focus, how we play without him. We know that team can't win a championship. It's really, how do we manage through it better? I felt like, on me, the depth wasn't quite there when he was out to win at the level we wanted to win at.\"\n\nWhile the Sixers and their fans might wish Embiid would take a summer off to rest up, he is set to play for USA Basketball at the Paris Olympics. The 76ers won't stand in Embiid's way.\n\n\"It's a dream of his to represent the United State in the Olympics,\" Morey said. \"I think it's important to support the dreams of your best player.\"\n\nWith the Sixers in win-now mode, a string of solid seasons usually has them drafting toward the mid to late first round. Maxey in 2020 was the last draft pick who made any kind of impact. The 76ers are scheduled to pick 16th overall and hold the 41st overall pick in the second round. While the draft quality has been knocked for having little depth, Morey said he's fine with staying at 16.\n\nWell, if he stays at 16.\n\n\"We don't really focus on the draft for help now,\" Morey said. \"I do really love 16. The storylines have been that the draft is worse. I don't see that at all. I'm very excited at who's at 16. That said, as you might expect, we have all options on the table. Trade into the future so we keep more picks available for future trades.\"\n\nMaxey\u00b4s career skyrocketed this season with his first All-Star berth, the NBA\u00b4s Most Improved Player award, and a season-extending 46-point effort in a Game 5 win in New York.\n\n\"We should all learn not to bet against Tyrese,\" Morey said.\n\nHe is a restricted free agent, meaning the 76ers could match any offer extended to the personable guard. Maxey is eligible to get a five-year, $205 million contract.\n\n\"A year ago, if we had polled everyone in the media or the GMs, it wouldn't have been unanimous that Tyrese could take that step forward that we hoped he could,\" Morey said.\n\n\"This offseason's a big one,\" Morey said. \"I owe it to the fans, to ownership, to everybody, to get this team in a place where we're competing for championships. We obviously didn't achieve it this year.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\n\nNew York Knicks' Jalen Brunson, right, and Philadelphia 76ers' Joel Embiid, left, embrace after Game 6 in an NBA basketball first-round playoff series, Thursday, May 2, 2024, in Philadelphia.

He earns a B-minus.", "body": "This refresher regarding the Sixers' most resonant points of inflection -- matching Paul Reed's contract and adding Buddy Hield do not qualify -- should help put Morey's Sixers career into perspective.\n\nAs it turned out, Daryl Morey's \"Four More Years\" is about as popular in Philly as Richard Nixon's 1972 campaign slogan. As Morey spends this summer searching for a third star to run with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, Sixers fans can only hope it turns out less diabolically.\n\n\"Someone at the wing ... who can deliver in the playoffs,\" Morey said. He isn't age-averse, so hello, 34-year-old Paul George, I guess.\n\nGive him credit. He takes big swings, and his boss, Josh Harris, loves that. How much?\n\nIn December, in the middle of his fourth year as Sixers president, Harris gave Morey got a contract extension that will, through the 2027-28 season, keep directly depositing $12 million annually from Harris' bank account into his.\n\nHas Morey earned it?\n\nHe wouldn't grade himself: \"I'll leave that to you guys.\"\n\nMission accepted. B-minus.\n\n\" READ MORE: The Process keeps progressing with Joel Embiid after Tobias Harris exits for the Sixers\n\nHe wouldn't answer if he thinks the team is better today than it was four years ago.\n\nIt sure doesn't feel like it's better. Not after the Ben Simmons drama, the James Harden saga, and the first-round exit last week at the hands of an anonymous Knicks roster.\n\nTo be fair, though, however little you think of the Prince of Analytics, you have to admit that not all of his decisions have been catastrophic. He met with the press Monday to review the latest lost season of 11-year-old \"Process\" and how he's fared in his tenure thus far.\n\nThis refresher regarding the Sixers' most resonant points of inflection -- matching Paul Reed's contract and adding Buddy Hield do not qualify -- should help put Morey's Sixers career into perspective.\n\nAl Horford, ill-suited and unhappy in Philadelphia, was the face of the failed \"Bully Ball\" experiment of 2020. Morey started work Nov. 4 and traded Horford on draft night two weeks later. There were three years and $81 million left on Horford's contract (which ultimately landed him back in Boston). It cost Morey first-round and second-round picks as well. Part of the return was Danny Green, whose professionalism instantly improved the Sixers' culture and whose presence influenced the development of Tyrese Maxey. But the trade was a clever example of addition by subtraction.\n\nMorey immediately gave credit to general manager Elton Brand and his staff for evaluating Maxey and advocating that the Sixers take him with the 21st overall pick. Even so, Morey deserves credit for not trading the pick and for not vetoing the pick. Remember, the Sixers already had Ben Simmons in their backcourt and planned to build around him for the next decade. Even if Morey doesn't get full credit for this decision, rest assured, if Maxey had flamed out like Simmons, Markelle Fultz, or Jahlil Okafor, Morey surely would have received full blame.\n\nAs the Sixers sought to rid themselves of a malcontented Simmons for malcontented James Harden, they refused to entertain the prospect of trading Maxey.\n\nThis, despite continual exhortations from accomplished NBA experts (like me) who misevaluated Maxey's ceiling.\n\nMorey gets full marks not just for his resoluteness in 2022, but also in the summer of 2023, when other teams began to recognize Maxey's potential. Said ESPN's Brian Windhorst:\n\n\"They are not going to trade Tyrese Maxey. They have made this clear. ... They want you to know that you cannot have Tyrese Maxey. Prime Michael Jordan is available? Don't call. Twenty-five-year-old LeBron James is available? Lose our number. Giannis Antetokounmpo says, 'I want to be a Sixer'? If Tyrese Maxey is the ask, just keep walking.\"\n\nMaxey has since become an All-Star, a dynamic scorer, and the Sixers' unquestioned alpha.\n\n\" READ MORE: The Sixers should trade Tyrese Maxey -- and Ben Simmons -- for the Nets' James Harden | Marcus Hayes\n\nThere has been much rumor and testimony about the Halliburton deal that didn't happen. In the moment, the general narrative ran thus: The Kings wanted to deal Halliburton but the Sixers couldn't meet their price. Since then, Morey has said there never was much smoke there, much less fire. Well, there should have been. Halliburton now is a 24-year-old top-10 player in the second round of the playoffs with Indiana (he ultimately was traded) who is under contract for the next four seasons who makes less money than Tobias Harris.\n\nImagine being able to pair a real point guard with Maxey.\n\nTrading (essentially) Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond, and a first-round pick for Harden seemed like a sound decision. It was. Also, a no-brainer.\n\nOnce again, Morey agreed with other accomplished NBA experts that Harden's decline in 2020-21 and 2021-22 was due less to his aging body and his outmoded game than his bad luck and bad rosters. This was a mistake. Harden's inconsistency on the court in the 2022-23 season, his lack of professionalism off the court (he flew to Las Vegas between the first and second rounds of the playoffs), and his collapse in the second round of the playoffs all were foreseeable. So was his holdout the following preseason.\n\nMorey finally grew out of his 11-year infatuation with Harden, around whom he first built the Rockets' repeated failures. Harden expected a four-year, $210 million max extension from the Sixers. Morey declined. It cost him Harden's fickle friendship and it cost him lots of face, but we all know it's better to abandon a bad relationship than to stay together purely out of pride.\n\nHarden and fellow dinosaur P.J. Tucker landed with the Clippers and brought the Sixers Nico Batum, Robert Covington, KJ Martin, Marcus Morris (briefly), and picks. Harden missed 21 of 28 shots in the Clippers' last two losses to the Mavericks, who bounced them in the first round last week.\n\nRivers, whom Morey inherited (by a month), had lost the team. Nurse was the best coach on the market.

But they kept battling.\n\nJust when most thought them dead in the water after a defensive drubbing in Game 4, they go back to Madison Square Garden for Game 5 and find a new lease on life in an overtime thriller sparked by Tyrese Maxey having the performance of a lifetime. Then they came back to Philly and climbed all the way back from a 22-point hole, taking everyone watching on a rollercoaster before the Knicks rediscovered their own way to close out.\n\nBut there was a pulse. There was heart. And looking ahead now, there's going to be a whole lot of room over the summer - from cap space to roster spots - to try and really revamp the team, with the most pressing task, Morey said Tuesday, being in finding a high-level wing that can compliment Embiid in Maxey, especially in those high-stakes playoff moments.\n\nAdding to that: Age isn't going to be a deterring factor in the search, Morey said.\n\n\"Obviously you have to factor in age,\" he explained. \"But we most are looking for - we feel like we're in the window where we have to win now. We're mostly focused on getting the best players to fit with Joel and Tyrese.\"\n\nWhich immediately feeds into rumors surrounding the 34-year old Paul George, who is due up for a new contract and with his future as a Clipper highly uncertain after their own first-round exit, and possibly a reunion with the also 34-year old Jimmy Butler, who has had murmurs of hitting a crossroads with the Heat that could open up room for a trade.\n\nOnly Embiid, Maxey (though he needs an extension), Paul Reed, and Ricky Council IV are guaranteed to be back for next season, which means there will be money to spend, and the Sixers have the advantage of a re-stocked cupboard of draft picks to work with in negotiations.\n\nThey're short on time with only so much of Embiid's prime left, but not on options over these next few months.\n\n\"I think as long as players are playing at a high level, we're focused on Joel and Tyrese, and we're focused on now,\" Morey said. \"So you have to factor in age because I have to look at more than just one season. But the reality is similar to we put most of our focus on the team when Joel is available, we put most of our focus on the now versus the future with where Joel is in his prime.\"\n\nTo that end, Morey praised Embiid's toughness in the latter half of the season to make his way back to the floor from injury and stay on it, and Maxey for taking another big leap forward with more responsibility, all while acknowledging his own failure to provide the team with enough depth to get by when Embiid wasn't on the court, and the fact that the roster isn't going to have a whole lot of continuity from this past season to the next.\n\nBut the core is still going to be there, and with a full year under head coach Nick Nurse now, which lends confidence to Morey that there is still a way to make this work.", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Morey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Reed_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Reed (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/USATSI_22112638_CqTTu8T.3c4c2468.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543858", "eventUri": "eng-9543858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The players couldn't get it done, Joel Embiid couldn't stay healthy, the coach was outdone, and Morey didn't do enough to surround his best players with the right pieces. Depending on who you ask, Morey ranks anywhere from first to fourth on the arbitrary blame list, with Sixers ownership and Josh Harris specifically getting thrown into the mix.\n\nIf I'm putting together the list, I can't put Morey any higher than third. Can't put him any higher than the coaches or the players, especially not in years past, with Doc Rivers on the sideline. Maybe this season you can blame the players first and GM second, depending on how you feel about the job Nick Nurse did in the postseason, but my Daryl take goes something like this:\n\nMorey has twice put together rosters good enough to go to the Eastern Conference Finals\n\nYou might call bullshit on that, but twice we've seen it in practice, once in 2021 and once in 2023. When Morey came him, he immediately got off Al Horford's contract, turned Josh Richardson into Seth Curry, and added Danny Green and Dwight Howard. That team finished 1st in the conference and I think we're all in agreement that they should have won that Hawks series. Maybe if Ben Simmons just dunked the damn ball instead of passing it, we wouldn't be writing columns like this one at all.\n\nThe other team was the 2022-2023 squad, full-season Harden with the Simmons saga in the rearview mirror. That team was a three seed, but won 54 games, which was the highest total since Allen Iverson led the Sixers to the finals more than 20 years ago. People seem to lose sight of this for some reason, probably because Milwaukee and Boston were 58 and 57-win teams, but this iteration of the Sixers won more games as a three seed than the 2020-2021 team as a 1 seed.\n\nIn came De'Anthony Melton, P.J. Tucker, and Danuel House. Harden settled and has his best three-point shooting year since 2012. Tyrese Maxey showed he was a legitimate player and even Tobias Harris played a consistent 74 games. Again Embiid was injured in the postseason, Harden worked some magic to singlehandedly win a couple of games in the Boston series, then had total clunkers in the others as the players and coach blew a 3-2 series lead with an opportunity to close it out in Game 6 at home.\n\nThe one take that I will never back down from is that the Sixers didn't lose that series for a lack of talent. The team was good enough to push the Celtics to the doorstep and they just didn't get the job done. Outside of perhaps the Boston bench, you can't make a legitimate argument that the Celtics were CLEARLY more talented. If anything, it was a wash.\n\nThat's why I can't go too hard on Morey. He's presided over what, four seasons now? Twice they went to Game 7 of the second round and should have advanced, but the coaches and players couldn't complete the task.\n\nIn terms of the Harden and Simmons thing, it's hard to say how much Morey is to blame or not blame for Ben wanting out, and then Harden also wanting out. Did he lie to his guy? Did he promise something and not deliver? Maybe, maybe not. Regardless, he turned Harden into a bunch of expiring contracts and provided himself the rare opportunity to wipe the slate completely clean and build a roster entirely around Embiid and Maxey. I liken it to what Howie Roseman did with Carson Wentz, i.e. turning a bad situation into a good one, with the caveat of making it 100% clear that you can't receive too much credit for fixing your own mistakes. We can all use hindsight to say Morey should have done something more in the Simmons deal (Tyrese Halliburton?), but the 2023 Harden team was good enough for the ECF, and he then turned around and flipped all of it into a Tabula Rasa.\n\nWhich brings us to this past season. What even was this season? It follows a pattern, be it intentional or not. Daryl comes in in year 1, makes a couple of shrewd moves, then builds a contender. The following year, they deal with the Simmons nonsense and retool with an eye on 2023. This year? Sort of the basketball equivalent of a gap year. He turned Harden into all of those expiring contracts, again looking ahead. I'm not sure anyone expected the Sixers to be as competitive as they were with Embiid, Maxey, and guys like Kelly Oubre, Nic Batum, and a bunch of role players. We can split hairs over whether or not he should have moved Marcus Morris and Pat Bev, or acquired the aging Kyle Lowry, but it's probably a moot point because the Sixers go as Embiid goes, regardless of who occupies roster spots 6 through 10. Admit it, you didn't think they were gonna do shit this year, then maybe begrudgingly started following along again when they overachieved early.\n\nIf this year was indeed some sort of precursor to a focused 2024-2025 season, then turn the Morey scrutiny meter up to 10. He's no longer saddled with the Tobias Harris contract, and anything weighing him down from prior regimes is now completely off the books. This is his chance to build around an oft-injured superstar headed to the wrong side of 30 and a young guard who looks to be the future. There's no other excuse, is there? No Doc Rivers to (justifiably) absorb a lot of the blame. No Simmons, no Harden. Morey is basically tearing this thing down to the studs and \"building back better,\" we hope. This will be year five as the window continues to close, so there's not much time remaining to get it right.\n\nDaryl starts to rise on the arbitrary ladder of blame. I just couldn't put him there in past seasons, because twice in four years he crafted rosters good enough for the conference finals.

Literally the day after the Sixers lost Game 6 to the Knicks, they were linked to three former All-Stars this coming offseason.\n\nWell, in his end-of-season media availability Monday at the Sixers practice facility in Camden, New Jersey, Daryl Morey did nothing to squelch those reports.\n\nArmed with loads of cap space and multiple draft picks -- perhaps the most he's ever been equipped with in his career as an executive -- the team's president of basketball operations has only one true mission: find the right player(s) to fit around Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.\n\n\"We're definitely looking at fit,\" Morey said. \"We're not really focused, necessarily, on the exact bucket, whether it's max, role player or whatever. We're focused on getting the best players within the CBA constraints, which is basically you only get so many; you only have so much money. Generally, historically, having top players works better. ... We're not going to have continuity. Hopefully, we'll have continuity going forward a little better. We'll have continuity with our stars and our head coach. But we're going to have a lot of change this offseason.\n\n\"Long story short, there isn't a formula. Everyone wants to find a pattern and there isn't one. The pattern is have really good players and have them (be) better than all the teams you're going to play. We're not going in with a prescription or proscription of what to do.\"\n\nEmbiid has consistently bemoaned the lack of continuity within the Sixers' organization, but did seem to be excited with the idea of the team building with Maxey. Morey and head coach Nick Nurse being under contract likely adds a level of continuity and stability that Embiid had been craving.\n\nThe question becomes literally everyone else.\n\nEmbiid is under contract through at least 2025-26. Maxey will assuredly get a max contract once the Sixers handle their other free agent business. Beyond that, Paul Reed, Ricky Council IV and Jeff Dowtin, Jr. are under contract for 2024-25, but their deals are not guaranteed. Everyone else is a free agent.\n\nWhile it's likely safe to say Tobias Harris will be moving on, the Sixers should have interest in bringing back some of their other free agents. Kelly Oubre, Jr. (who could maybe do the Bobby Portis special), Nicolas Batum and Kyle Lowry played major roles for the Sixers. Cameron Payne and De'Anthony Melton seem like two players Nurse wouldn't mind having back. Buddy Hield's future here feels murky, though the sharpshooter was a huge factor in the Sixers nearly taking Game 6.\n\n\"We have interest in pretty much all our free agents,\" Morey said. \"It's just we're definitely not going to bring them all back; it's just the reality of the league.\"\n\nA new reality of the league is the punitive nature of the current CBA with teams choosing to build around Big Threes. Both the Clippers and Suns went down without a whimper in the first round. That doesn't mean teams should necessarily abandon the strategy altogether. The Nuggets and Celtics have eschewed paying for depth, instead relying on a few high-level players and it's worked out quite well.\n\nThere will be plenty of debate over what the Sixers should do next. The optionality with two superstars and the ability to acquire another is enough to make the entire city's imagination run wild. Then again, Embiid and Maxey could've maybe used just a little bit more help to get the job done against the Knicks and likely been favorites to beat the Pacers and reach the conference finals.\n\nOne thing is for sure in that Morey will not let the new CBA deter him from adding a third max player -- if said player is a fit next to Embiid and Maxey.\n\nIn fact, Monday's presser almost felt like a smoke signal to Paul George, Jimmy Butler and any other star wing that might be willing to leave their current team.\n\n\"Again, I would reframe it as, 'Compared to what?'\" Morey said. \"And in those situations, I like having the challenge, finding the guys that are overlooked -- the Kelly Oubres of the world. Getting a Kyle Lowry. Guys like that. I like that challenge. I think that's something that the front office is very good at.\n\n\"So I think, yeah, compared to ... basically you're like, 'Have less good players, but more role players.' I think generally, the history of the NBA would favor -- even with the new CBA -- get studs who you can then put the work and the onus on the front office to find the players that fit around (them).\"\n\nYou don't have to read between the lines too much there.\n\nBut Morey is leaving all his options in a year where he should have plenty.\n\n\"It's always about get the best players you can,\" Morey said, \"get a great coach, figure out how to win with that set of players, and then go win the damn thing. It's not about, 'Hey, this new thing is exactly how everyone ...' We do know you want to be able to shoot more. I think we've learned that. That one's a long trend, going for a long time.

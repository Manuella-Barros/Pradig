reprimanded France for breaching the bloc's budget rules under President Emmanuel Macron, 10 days before snap elections marked by lavish spending promises.\n\nThe news will be a blow to Macron as it is the first time France returns to the EU's public spending sin bin since he came to power in 2017.\n\nAnd it sets the stage for a potential clash between Paris and Brussels following elections on June 30 and July 7 -- in which the far right and left, ahead in the polls, are pledging to spend billions more at a time when France will need to make cuts.\n\nAlongside France, the European Commission said \"the opening of a deficit-based excessive deficit procedure is warranted\" for Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.\n\nThe procedure kickstarts a process forcing a country to negotiate a plan with Brussels to get their debt or deficit levels back on track.\n\nThe seven countries had deficits -- the shortfall between government revenue and spending -- above three percent of gross domestic product, in violation of the bloc's fiscal rules.\n\nThe centrist Macron plunged France into political turmoil by calling the snap vote after his party's crushing defeat to the far right in EU elections earlier this month.\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that France could be thrown into a debt crisis if the spending programmes of either the far right or a new left-wing alliance were adopted.\n\nBut senior EU officials refused to be publicly drawn on what the impact of France's vote could be on its fiscal discipline.\n\nA French finance ministry source said France's deficit would return from last year's 5.5 percent to below three percent by 2027 \"provided a new government doesn't go in a different direction\".\n\n- 'No return to austerity' -\n\nBrussels is reprimanding nations for the first time since the EU suspended the rules after the 2020 Covid pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war, as states propped up businesses and households with public money.\n\nThe EU spent two years during the suspension overhauling the budget rules to make them more workable and give greater leeway for investment in critical areas like defence.\n\nBut two sacred goals remain: a state's debt must not go higher than 60 percent of national output, with a public deficit of no more than three percent.\n\n\"Our economic and fiscal policies are now entering a new cycle,\" said the EU's economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni.\n\n\"This does not mean 'back to normal', because we are not living in normal times; and definitely not 'back to austerity', because this would be a terrible mistake.\"\n\nThe commission will propose opening excessive deficit procedures for the seven countries in July to the EU's finance ministers.\n\nIt also noted that Romania had \"not taken effective action to correct\" its excessive deficit, despite opening a procedure in 2020 based on 2019 data.\n\nFrance aside, the EU countries with the highest deficit-to-GDP ratios last year are Italy (7.4 percent), Hungary (6.7 percent), Romania (6.6 percent) and Poland (5.1 percent).\n\nItalian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said Italy had expected the move and would continue on its path to \"sustainable public finances, which is welcomed by the markets and EU institutions\".\n\n- Stronger enforcement vow -\n\nCountries failing to remedy the situation can in theory be hit with fines of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) a year, until action is taken to address the violation.\n\nIn practice, though, the commission has never gone as far as levying fines -- fearing it could trigger unintended political consequences and hurt a state's economy.\n\nEU officials have however stressed there would be stronger enforcement this time round.\n\nThe commission said states must send their multi-annual spending plans by September 20 for scrutiny and it will then publish its recommendations in November.\n\nThe new rules stipulate that countries with an excessive deficit must reduce it by 0.5 points each year, which would require a massive undertaking.\n\nBut the rules also now give greater flexibility for investment in critical areas like defence and the green and digital transition.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The news will be a blow to Macron, as it is the first time France returns to the EU's public spending sin bin since he came to power in 2017. And it sets the stage for a potential clash between Paris and Brussels following elections on 30 June and 7 July -- in which the far right and left, ahead in the polls, are pledging to spend billions more at a time when France will need to make cuts. Alongside France, the European Commission said \"the opening of a deficit-based excessive deficit procedure is warranted\" for Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.\n\nThe procedure kickstarts a process forcing a country to negotiate a plan with Brussels to get their debt or deficit levels back on track.\n\nThe seven countries had deficits -- the shortfall between government revenue and spending -- above three percent of gross domestic product, in violation of the bloc's fiscal rules. The centrist Macron plunged France into political turmoil by calling the snap vote after his party's crushing defeat to the far-right in EU elections earlier this month.\n\nFinance minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that France could be thrown into a debt crisis if the spending programmes of either the far-right or a new left-wing alliance were adopted.\n\nBut senior EU officials refused to be publicly drawn on what the impact of France's vote could be on its fiscal discipline.\n\nA French finance ministry source said France's deficit would return from last year's 5.5% to below three percent by 2027, \"provided a new government doesn't go in a different direction\".\n\nBrussels is reprimanding nations for the first time since the EU suspended the rules after the 2020 Covid pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war, as states propped up businesses and households with public money. The EU spent two years during the suspension overhauling the budget rules to make them more workable, and give greater leeway for investment in critical areas like defence.\n\nBut two sacred goals remain: a state's debt must not go higher than 60% of national output, with a public deficit of no more than three percent.\n\n\"Our economic and fiscal policies are now entering a new cycle,\" said the EU's economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni. \"This does not mean 'back to normal', because we are not living in normal times; and definitely not 'back to austerity', because this would be a terrible mistake.\"\n\nThe commission will propose opening excessive deficit procedures for the seven countries in July to the EU's finance ministers.\n\nIt also noted that Romania had \"not taken effective action to correct\" its excessive deficit, despite opening a procedure in 2020 based on 2019 data.\n\nFrance aside, the EU countries with the highest deficit-to-GDP ratios last year are Italy (7.4%), Hungary (6.7%), Romania (6.6%) and Poland (5.1%).\n\nItalian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said Italy had expected the move, and would continue on its path to \"sustainable public finances, which is welcomed by the markets and EU institutions\".\n\nCountries failing to remedy the situation can in theory be hit with fines of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) a year, until action is taken to address the violation.\n\nIn practice, though, the commission has never gone as far as levying fines -- fearing it could trigger unintended political consequences and hurt a state's economy.", "source": {"uri": "neweralive.na", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Era Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person",

Spain and the Czech Republic exceeded the three percent limit in 2023 but should be back in line this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Estonia's deficit-to-GDP ratio is above three percent but its debt is around 20 percent of GDP, significantly below the 60 percent limit.\n\nThe commission will look at the states' data in 2023 but \"will also take into account the developments expected for 2024 and beyond\", the expert told AFP.\n\nMember states must send their multi-annual spending plans by October for the EU to scrutinise and the commission will then publish its recommendations in November.\n\nUnder the new rules, countries with an excessive deficit must reduce it by 0.5 points each year, which would require a massive undertaking at a moment when states need to pour money into the green and digital transition, as well as defence.\n\nAdopted in 1997 ahead of the arrival of the single Currency in 1999, the rules known as the Stability and Growth Pact seek to prevent lax budgetary policies -- a

"BRUSSELS (AFP) - The European Commission on Wednesday reprimanded France for breaching the EU's budget rules under President Emmanuel Macron, in the run-up to snap elections marked by lavish spending promises.\n\nThe news will be a blow to Macron as it is the first time France returns to the EU's public-spending sin bin since he came to power in 2017.\n\nAnd it sets the stage for a potential clash between Paris and Brussels following elections on June 30 and July 7 - in which the far right and left, ahead in the polls, are pledging to spend more at a time when France will need to make cuts.\n\nAlongside France, the European Union's executive arm said \"the opening of a deficit-based excessive deficit procedure is warranted\" for Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.\n\nThe procedure kickstarts a process forcing a debt-overloaded country to negotiate a plan with Brussels to get back on track.\n\nThe seven countries had deficits - the shortfall between government revenue and spending - above 3% of gross domestic product, in violation of the bloc's fiscal rules.\n\nThe centrist Macron plunged France into political turmoil by calling the snap vote after his party's crushing defeat to the far right in the EU elections earlier this month.\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that France could be thrown into a debt crisis if the spending programs of either the far right or a new left-wing alliance were adopted.\n\nThe political uncertainty has hurt French stocks as Paris, which was Europe's biggest stock market by valuation, lost its crown this week to London.\n\n'No return to austerity'\n\nBrussels is reprimanding nations for the first time since the EU suspended the rules after the 2020 Covid pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war, as states propped up businesses and households with public money.\n\nThe EU spent two years during the suspension overhauling the budget rules to make them more workable and give greater leeway for investment in critical areas like defense.\n\nBut two sacred goals remain: A state's debt must not go higher than 60% of national output, with a public deficit of no more than 3%.\n\n\"After almost four years under the General Escape Clause, our economic and fiscal policies are now entering a new cycle,\" the EU's economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said in a statement.\n\n\"This does not mean 'back to normal,' because we are not living in normal times; and definitely not 'back to austerity,' because this would be a terrible mistake.\"\n\nThe commission will formally propose opening excessive deficit procedures for the seven countries in July to the EU's finance ministers.\n\nIt also noted in Wednesday's statement that Romania had \"not taken effective action to correct\" its excessive deficit, despite opening a procedure in 2020 based on 2019 data.\n\nThe EU countries with the highest deficit-to-GDP ratios last year are Italy (7.4%), Hungary (6.7%), Romania (6.6%), France (5.5%) and Poland (5.1%).\n\nBreak with the past\n\nCountries failing to remedy the situation can in theory be hit with fines of 0.1% of GDP a year, until action is taken to address the violation.\n\nIn practice, though, the commission has never gone as far as levying fines - fearing it could trigger unintended political consequences and hurt a state's economy.\n\nMember states must send their multiannual spending plans by October for the EU to scrutinize and the commission will then publish its recommendations in November.\n\nUnder the new rules, countries with an excessive deficit must reduce it by 0.5 points each year, which would require a massive undertaking.\n\nBut the rules also now give greater flexibility for investment in critical areas like defense and the green and digital transition.\n\nAdopted in 1997 ahead of the arrival of the single currency in 1999, the rules known as the Stability and Growth Pact seek to prevent lax budgetary policies - a concern of Germany - by setting the strict goal of balanced accounts.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "europesun.com"}, "authors": [],

Alongside France, the EU's executive arm said \"the opening of a deficit-based excessive deficit procedure is warranted\" for Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.\n\nThe procedure kickstarts a process forcing a debt-overloaded country to negotiate a plan with Brussels to get back on track. The seven countries had deficits - the shortfall between government revenue and spending - above 3% of gross domestic product, in violation of the bloc's fiscal rules.\n\nThe news will be a blow to Macron as it is the first time France returns to the EU's public spending sin bin since he came to power in 2017. And it sets the stage for a potential clash between Paris and Brussels following elections on June 30 and July 7 - in which the far right and left, ahead in the polls, are pledging to spend more at a time when France will need to make cuts.\n\nMacron plunged France into political turmoil by calling the snap vote after his party's crushing defeat to the far right in the EU elections earlier this month. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that France could be thrown into a debt crisis if the spending programs of either the far right or a new left-wing alliance were adopted.\n\nThe political uncertainty has hurt French stocks as Paris, which was Europe's biggest stock market by valuation, lost its crown this week to London.\n\nBrussels is reprimanding nations for the first time since the EU suspended the rules after the 2020 Covid pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war, as states propped up businesses and households with public money. The EU spent two years during the suspension overhauling the budget rules to make them more workable and give greater leeway for investment in critical areas like defense. But two sacred goals remain: a state's debt must not go higher than 60% of national output, with a public deficit of no more than 3%.\n\n\"After almost four years under the General Escape Clause, our economic and fiscal policies are now entering a new cycle,\" the EU's economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said in a statement. \"This does not mean 'back to normal,' because we are not living in normal times; and definitely not 'back to austerity,' because this would be a terrible mistake.\"\n\nThe Commission will formally propose opening excessive deficit procedures for the seven countries in July to the EU's finance ministers. It also noted in Wednesday's statement that Romania had \"not taken effective action to correct\" its excessive deficit, despite opening a procedure in 2020 based on 2019 data. The EU countries with the highest deficit-to-GDP ratios last year are Italy (7.4%), Hungary (6.7%), Romania (6.6%), France (5.5%) and Poland (5.1%).\n\nCountries failing to remedy the situation can in theory be hit with fines of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) a year, until action is taken to address the violation. In practice, though, the Commission has never gone as far as levying fines - fearing it could trigger unintended political consequences and hurt a state's economy.\n\nMember states must send their multi-annual spending plans by October for the EU to scrutinise and the Commission will then publish its recommendations in November. Under the new rules, countries with an excessive deficit must reduce it by 0.5 points each year, which would require a massive undertaking. But the rules also now give greater flexibility for investment in critical areas like defense and the green and digital transition.\n\nAdopted in 1997 ahead of the arrival of the single currency in

Spain and the Czech Republic exceeded the three percent limit in 2023 but should be back in line this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Estonia's deficit-to-GDP ratio is above three percent but its debt is around 20 percent of GDP, significantly below the 60 percent limit.\n\nThe commission will look at the states' data in 2023 but \"will also take into account the developments expected for 2024 and beyond\", the expert told AFP.\n\nMember states must send their multi-annual spending plans by October for the EU to scrutinise and the commission will then publish its recommendations in November.\n\nUnder the new rules, countries with an excessive deficit must reduce it by 0.5 points each year, which would require a massive undertaking at a moment when states need to pour money into the green and digital transition, as well as defence.\n\nAdopted in 1997 ahead of the arrival of the single currency in 1999, the rules known as the Stability and Growth Pact seek to prevent lax budgetary policies -- a concern of Germany -- by setting the strict goal of balanced accounts.\n\naro-raz/ec/db\n\nMore from this section\n\nSecured Signing Scales Up with Strategic Leadership and Global Expansion\n\nOver 75 million people in the US are under heat alerts.

and definitely not 'back to austerity', because this would be a terrible mistake.\"\n\nThe commission will propose opening excessive deficit procedures for the seven countries in July to the EU's finance ministers.\n\nIt also noted that Romania had \"not taken effective action to correct\" its excessive deficit, despite opening a procedure in 2020 based on 2019 data.\n\nFrance aside, the EU countries with the highest deficit-to-GDP ratios last year are Italy (7.4 percent), Hungary (6.7 percent), Romania (6.6 percent) and Poland (5.1 percent).\n\nItalian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said Italy had expected the move and would continue on its path to \"sustainable public finances, which is welcomed by the markets and EU institutions\".\n\n- Stronger enforcement vow -\n\nCountries failing to remedy the situation can in theory be hit with fines of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) a year, until action is taken to address the violation.\n\nIn practice, though, the commission has never gone as far as levying fines -- fearing it could trigger unintended political consequences and hurt a state's economy.\n\nEU officials have however stressed there would be stronger enforcement this time round.\n\nThe commission said states must send their multi-annual spending plans by September 20 for scrutiny and it will then publish its recommendations in November.\n\nThe new rules stipulate that countries with an excessive deficit must reduce it by 0.5 points each year, which would require a massive undertaking.\n\nBut the rules also now give greater flexibility for investment in critical areas like defence and the green and digital transition.\n\nraz/ec/rl\n\nMore from this section\n\nStack Sports and The Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) Renew Strategic Partnership to Grow Participation\n\nOver 75 million people in the US are under heat alerts.

for breaking budget rules", "body": "French President Emmanuel Macron's call for a snap election this month has plunged France into political turmoil\n\nThe European Commission on Wednesday reprimanded France for breaching the EU's budget rules under President Emmanuel Macron, in the runup to snap elections marked by lavish spending promises.\n\nThe news will be a blow to Macron as it is the first time France returns to the EU's public spending sin bin since he came to power in 2017.\n\nAnd it sets the stage for a potential clash between Paris and Brussels following elections on June 30 and July 7 -- in which the far right and left, ahead in the polls, are pledging to spend more at a time when France will need to make cuts.\n\nAlongside France, the European Union's executive arm said \"the opening of a deficit-based excessive deficit procedure is warranted\" for Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.\n\nThe procedure kickstarts a process forcing a debt-overloaded country to negotiate a plan with Brussels to get back on track.\n\nThe seven countries had deficits -- the shortfall between government revenue and spending -- above three percent of gross domestic product, in violation of the bloc's fiscal rules.\n\nThe centrist Macron plunged France into political turmoil by calling the snap vote after his party's crushing defeat to the far right in the EU elections earlier this month.\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that France could be thrown into a debt crisis if the spending programmes of either the far right or a new left-wing alliance were adopted.\n\nThe political uncertainty has hurt French stocks as Paris, which was Europe's biggest stock market by valuation, lost its crown this week to London.\n\n- 'No return to austerity' -\n\nBrussels is reprimanding nations for the first time since the EU suspended the rules after the 2020 Covid pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war, as states propped up businesses and households with public money.\n\nThe EU spent two years during the suspension overhauling the budget rules to make them more workable and give greater leeway for investment in critical areas like defence.\n\nBut two sacred goals remain: a state's debt must not go higher than 60 percent of national output, with a public deficit of no more than three percent.\n\nMore from

four years under the General Escape Clause, our economic and fiscal policies are now entering a new cycle,\" the EU's economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said in a statement.\n\n\"This does not mean 'back to normal', because we are not living in normal times; and definitely not 'back to austerity', because this would be a terrible mistake.\"\n\nThe commission will formally propose opening excessive deficit procedures for the seven countries in July to the EU's finance ministers.\n\nIt also noted in Wednesday's statement that Romania had \"not taken effective action to correct\" its excessive deficit, despite opening a procedure in 2020 based on 2019 data.\n\nThe EU countries with the highest deficit-to-GDP ratios last year are Italy (7.4 percent), Hungary (6.7 percent), Romania (6.6 percent), France (5.5 percent) and Poland (5.1 percent).\n\n- Break with the past -\n\nCountries failing to remedy the situation can in theory be hit with fines of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) a year, until action is taken to address the violation.\n\nIn practice, though, the commission has never gone as far as levying fines -- fearing it could trigger unintended political consequences and hurt a state's economy.\n\nMember states must send their multi-annual spending plans by October for the EU to scrutinise and the commission will then publish its recommendations in November.\n\nUnder the new rules, countries with an excessive deficit must reduce it by 0.5 points each year, which would require a massive undertaking.\n\nBut the rules also now give greater flexibility for investment in critical areas like defence and the green and digital transition.\n\nAdopted in 1997 ahead of the arrival of the single currency in 1999, the rules known as the Stability and Growth Pact seek to prevent lax budgetary policies -- a concern of Germany -- by setting the strict goal of balanced accounts.\n\nraz/ec/lth", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news",

We look forward to receiving national fiscal structural plans from member states that bring down debt and deficit and reflect today's recommendations.\"\n\nRomania has the largest deficit among EU member nations, with it predicted to now be 7 percent of its GDP.\n\nFrance had the second-largest in 2023, at 5.5 percent of GDP.\n\nThe EU's financial rules, which were introduced in the 1990s as the bloc developed its common currency, call for member countries to limit deficits to a maximum of 3 percent of GDP.\n\nIn 2020, the bloc ordered Romania to ensure its deficit was back under control by 2022, but the novel coronavirus pandemic intervened and Brussels suspended its rules as nations ramped up spending on healthcare.\n\nBrussels said this week Romania must now reform its taxation system and shrink the salaries of government workers in a bid to reduce spending.\n\nThe EU also said several other members are running high deficits but will not yet be sanctioned. These included Estonia, which has ramped up spending on defense since the outbreak of the nearby Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe Czech Republic, Finland, Slovenia, and Spain were also warned they had breached budget rules, albeit temporarily.\n\nThe rules around the size of budget deficits that nations can carry have caused bitter rifts among EU member countries in the past, with financially prudent countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, criticizing apparently free-spending countries, including Greece and Italy, and complaining that their deficits were impacting the rest of the bloc.\n\nThe EU will next discuss the eight nations' alleged spending irregularities in December. In the meantime, the countries must submit roadmaps in September that detail how they plan to put their financial houses in order. The EU also plans to issue guidelines in the fall on how countries can reduce spending.\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"},

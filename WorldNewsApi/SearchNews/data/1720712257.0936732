When the exercise starts on Monday, June 10, the team will focus attention on Christ Church. The areas to be sprayed are Upper Carters Gap, Rollins Road, Bournes Land, Goodland Gardens, Highway U, and environs. The following day, Tuesday, June 11, the team will make the first of four stops in St James when they fog West Terrace Avenues 1 to 16, West Terrace Heights, and surrounding districts. A return to that parish on Wednesday, June 12, will see fogging at Wanstead Terrace 1 to 11 Avenues, Oxnards, Oxnards Heights, and environs. The following day, Thursday, June 13, the Unit will spray Orange Hill, Orange Hill Development, and neighbouring districts. The programme concludes on Friday, June 14, in the St James areas of Haynesville, Durants Village, and environs. Fogging will run from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m., each day. Householders are asked to assist in the control of the Aedes aegypti mosquito by opening all windows and doors to allow the fog to penetrate. Persons with respiratory problems are asked to protect themselves from inhaling the fog. Pedestrians and motorists should proceed with caution when encountering fogging operations on the street and parents are instructed to prohibit children from playing in the fog or running behind the fogging machine. Members of the public are advised that the completion of scheduled fogging activities may be affected by events beyond the Unit\u2019s control. In such circumstances, the Unit will return to affected communities as soon as possible.

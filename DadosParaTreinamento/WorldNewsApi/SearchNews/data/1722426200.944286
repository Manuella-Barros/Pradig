{"id": 243317706, "title": "Lily Gladstone: \u2018We are done with being told our stories won\u2019t resonate. That\u2019s been proven wrong so often\u2019", "text": "We\u2019re accustomed to seeing runners-up putting on a brave face at the Academy Awards. Remember when a crestfallen Michael Keaton folded a piece of paper \u2013 his speech, presumably \u2013 and put it in his pocket after Eddie Redmayne was instead called to the stage, for The Theory of Everything? Or when Samuel L Jackson muttered \u201csh**\u201d as Martin Landau won best supporting actor, for Ed Wood? It\u2019s three months since Lily Gladstone, the first Native American to be nominated for the best actress Oscar, lost out to Emma Stone. But the actor, who won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards ahead of Stone, doesn\u2019t seem too bothered by the upset. \u201cI just want to be part of this moment,\u201d she says. Right now that moment includes Under the Bridge, a new crime series written around Gladstone\u2019s investigating police officer, based on the true-life murder of a Canadian teen, Reena Virk; and Fancy Dance, a nail-biting road movie that premiered at Sundance last year and is about to land on Apple TV+. The film pivots around a particularly pressing issue for the Native American community: the number of missing and murdered indigenous women. In 2020 alone, according to FBI figures, there were 5,295 reports of missing American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls. \u201cErica Tremblay, the director, had written with me in mind,\u201d says Gladstone, who lived on a Blackfeet Nation reservation in Montana as a girl. \u201cThe film grew from our desire to work together and her wanting to put me in a leading role in a feature that occupied this queer, Native space. I was unbelievably hooked and elated when I saw the first draught. I felt like I read it in 15 minutes, even though I know it was an hour. I never told Erica this \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to scare her \u2013 but I was afraid I wasn\u2019t up to it.\u201d Fancy Dance follows two women living on Oklahoma\u2019s Seneca-Cayuga reservation. Gladstone plays Jax, whose sister has disappeared and is therefore caring for her teenage niece. A heavy drinker, an occasional shoplifter and a queer patron of the local strip club, Jax can\u2019t rouse the authorities to take an interest in her missing sibling. But child-protection services are quick to swoop against her custody of Roki (Isabel Deroy-Olson). The pair go on the lam, hoping to find Roki\u2019s mother in time for the girl\u2019s ceremonial dance at an upcoming powwow. Tense final scenes play out against a dance to honour missing and murdered indigenous women at the First Americans Museum, in Oklahoma City. \u201cWomen\u2019s fancy dance arose from a Ponca woman getting frustrated and wanting to break out of women\u2019s traditional dancing,\u201d says Gladstone, who uses both she/her and they/them pronouns, in keeping with the ungendered pronouns of her tribe. \u201cThis woman wanted to dance the way the men did. So she grabbed a scarf and started doing fancy footwork. That evolved into the fancy shawl dance you see in the movie, during which you\u2019re trying to emulate a butterfly. It\u2019s the most balletic of the powwow dances. Knowing that Jax\u2019s dance is a woman picking up a man\u2019s job felt like the ultimate indigenous embrace of femininity, in the western sense of the word. She occupies a masculine space, but she\u2019s a matriarch in the moment.\u201d In this androgynous spirit, Gladstone looked to male cousins to help realise Jax, a complex character in a drama that skilfully negotiates contemporary hardships and community empowerment. \u201cMy cousin Will has a chequered past and an amazing ability to turn his life around,\u201d Gladstone says. \u201cHe\u2019s a leader in the community and one of the strongest people I know. Like Jax, he turns to traditional medicines, makes sure the language is being taught, and does the footwork for finding our missing relatives. My cousin Chet and I were both raised on the res together, out on the land with our dads. Just having the long braid Chet\u2019s got was a little thing that helped me find that character.\u201d Quick-witted, articulate and stately, Gladstone is both of Blackfeet and Nez Perc\u00e9 heritage and a first cousin four times removed of William Ewart Gladstone, who was prime minister of Britain in the late 19th century; her paternal great-great-grandfather was Red Crow, the Kainai Nation chief. (On a recent visit to the Ifta awards, she impressed the red carpet with her knowledge of the Choctaw efforts for famine-ravaged Ireland in 1847.) Gladstone learned Osage for her role as Mollie Burkhart, the besieged heroine at the centre of a genocidal plot in Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon. For Fancy Dance she learned Cayuga, a language that\u2019s estimated to have fewer than 20 remaining first-language speakers. \u201cIt was such a different process than for learning Osage,\u201d says the actor. \u201cI had several months of language lessons within an entire department for Killers of the Flower Moon. Fancy Dance was made for a fraction of the budget. We had two weeks and maybe four sessions with a language teacher who teaches Seneca Cayuga to a group of kids using an immersive Montessori approach. Isabel and I were so committed to making sure we didn\u2019t make those remaining speakers cringe. The best compliment we got was when the elders, who speak the language fluently, were able to watch without trying to read the subtitles!\u201d Gladstone fell in love with cinema after seeing The Return of the Jedi as a five-year-old. \u201cI wanted to be an Ewok, so badly,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s that age-old story of indigenous resistance: the protectors of the forest keeping their land. But as I grew older I found I wasn\u2019t the only Native kid who loved Ewoks.\u201d Her early ambitions were encouraged by her parents, particularly her dad, who started implanting \u201cearworms about being a movie star and Oscar-winner\u201d in her early childhood. \u201cWhen I could first conceptualise what acting was, it\u2019s because you comfort yourself or your parents comfort you when one of your favourite characters gets shot or killed,\u201d Gladstone says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re, like, \u2018No, honey: it\u2019s just an actor. It\u2019s an actor.\u2019 Somehow I got it into my head: \u2018Okay, I want to be in that story.\u2019\u201d When she was 11 her family moved to Washington State; as a teenager Gladstone enrolled in Stone Soup, an educational theatre company in Seattle, and appeared in student films. She returned to Montana for university. \u201cI always was so homesick,\u201d she told the Seattle Times about spending her teenage years in the city. \u201cI was born and raised on my reservation, in my mountains, on my plains. That\u2019s still where I feel the most full.\u201d Gladstone\u2019s earliest professional work typically involved community projects, therapy for survivors of domestic violence, and giving free acting classes for Native American women. Her stealthily impressive career, which includes roles in Arnaud Desplechin\u2019s 2013 Palme d\u2019Or contender Jimmy P: Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian and the TV series Billions and Reservation Dogs, has made her a regular collaborator with the directors Alex and Andrew Smith, Morrissa Maltz and Kelly Reichardt. Scorsese saw her in Reichardt\u2019s Certain Women. She was his first and only choice for Killers of the Flower Moon. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of her,\u201d he said. Gladstone was considering quitting acting before the director called. \u201cMarty is such an encyclopedia, so it feels like he is an actor\u2019s director,\u201d she says. \u201cHe leaves so much for the actor. He\u2019s completely consumed by his shot list, with other films he\u2019s referencing. He\u2019s always concerned with the arc of the whole film. He believes in his actors to show him what a scene is about and then you work together.\u201d Her professional rise heralds a new age for indigenous actors and representation. Twelve months after Fancy Dance\u2019s premiere at Sundance, seven indigenous projects screened at this year\u2019s festival. It\u2019s a relief, the actor says, to move away from the dichotomy of \u201cbloodthirsty savage and noble savage\u201d. \u201cStories like Fancy Dance and Reservation Dogs confirm what we\u2019ve always known,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter these years of auditioning for roles that are not created by us but set out to accomplish a certain image or trope, we are done with being told our stories are too esoteric or won\u2019t resonate with a broader audience. That\u2019s been proven wrong so often. \u201cFilm-making has a lot more flavour than it had when John Ford\u2019s westerns were largely shaping people\u2019s perspectives of Native Americans. We want more nuanced stories and other perspectives. It feels like we are coming to a golden age of storytelling.\u201d Fancy Dance, she has said, \u201cis the absolute best film to watch in tandem with Killers of the Flower Moon. It\u2019s the same land, the same issues, exactly 100 years later, and how they\u2019ve manifested into the modern age\u201d. Whatever about Gladstone being passed over at the Oscars, the Blackfeet Nation honoured her last year by declaring Lily Gladstone Day and honouring the star with a headdress. \u201cThere are about 100 women who have one of these today,\u201d she says. \u201cThe headdress has a life of its own. It comes to you either through someone\u2019s dream or because you\u2019ve been deemed somebody who needs to have this. It highlights me in my community as somebody who is a leader. A lot of the women-run non-profit that address domestic violence or teen suicide. They address the ways our government inhibits us from being able to protect ourselves. They work in food shelters and food-sovereignty initiatives. These are community-building women. \u201cI still don\u2019t fully understand why I\u2019ve been identified as somebody who was brought into that circle. It might be as simple as me accepting the Golden Globe in the Blackfoot language. It\u2019s a way of saying we\u2019re still here.\u201d Fancy Dance is available on Apple TV", "summary": "The Native American Oscar nominee broke new ground in Killers of the Flower Moon.

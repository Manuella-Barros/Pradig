' 'Nepo Baby' Criticisms Over 'The Lion King' Are Unfair", "text": "Kanye West and Kim Kardashian\u2019s daughter North West is catching heat after taking the stage in a Memorial Day weekend production of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d at The Hollywood Bowl. The live concert special was a two-night event honoring the 30th anniversary of the animated film. But North didn\u2019t just have any role \u2014 she wasn\u2019t covered up somewhere as \u201cGiraffe Number One.\u201d The 10-year-old was one of the stars, playing the role of Young Simba and singing the hit song \u201cI Just Can\u2019t Wait to Be King.\u201d Other celebrity guests included Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Jennifer Hudson and Jason Weaver, who voiced Young Simba in the 1994 film. Although proud mama Kim beamed with pride over her daughter\u2019s performance, the social media backlash came fast and furious from those who thought North had no business being in the lead role. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but casting North West as Simba when there are hundreds of properly trained theatre kids with voice coaches, dance skills, and experience was a HORRIBLE choice. It definitely makes you question the credibility of the casting director. You let Kim pay to ruin your show,\u201d wrote @_RichieDinero on X. But not everyone agreed with the outrage that North West leaned on her Kardashian connection to snag her role. Author Marc Lamont Hill argued that nepotism is nothing new in Hollywood. When it comes to casting, he says, eyeballs and ticket sales often trump talent. I mean, have you seen \u201cBelly?\u201d \u201cIn every movie, every play, every domain of pop culture, somebody casts somebody who\u2019s not that good...We\u2019ve put rappers in movies for the last 30 years ... and the reason we do it is because people are famous and famous people bring in tickets,\u201d he told TMZ. There are plenty of nepo babies who totally deserve all of the shine, including Zo\u00eb Kravitz, John David Washington, Rashida Jones, Maya Rudolph, and, of course, Tracee Ellis Ross. But tone deaf or not, the show\u2019s producers knew what they were doing when they cast North as Young Simba. We probably wouldn\u2019t even be talking about this production if it weren\u2019t for all of the chatter. And because people are talking about it now, even more people will want to see (and judge) North\u2019s performance for themselves when \u201cThe Lion King at the Hollywood Bowl\u201d streams on Disney+.", "summary": "<img class=\"type:primaryImage\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_80,w_636/46a641cddd823f48ab347d333b24a0b5.jpg\"/><p>Kanye West and Kim Kardashian\u2019s daughter<a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 lcFFec js_link\" href=\"https://www.theroot.com/willow-blue-ivy-north-west-and-more-celeb-kids-with-t-1851355253\">North West</a> is catching heat after <a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 lcFFec js_link\" href=\"https://people.com/north-west-wore-her-own-costume-lion-king-live-show-8654287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taking the stage </a>in a Memorial Day weekend production of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d at The Hollywood Bowl.

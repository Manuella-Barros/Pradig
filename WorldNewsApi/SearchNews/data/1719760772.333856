{"id": 225020976, "title": "In Tense Election Year, Lyft & Lime Will Again Give Voters Free Rides", "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The country is so polarized over this year\u2019s presidential election that many companies that fielded flashy consumer \u201cget out the vote\u201d efforts in the past are expected to produce much lower-profile campaigns if not sit this cycle out. That is not the case, however, for the transportation companies Lyft (primarily known for cars) and Lime (primarily know for electric scooters and bikes.) Of course, it makes sense for companies in the mobility business to focus on nonpartisan voter assistance programs that get people to the polls. Lime has been helping get out the vote since 2018 and has even bigger plans for 2024 Lime Research conducted after the 2016 election revealed that a significant number of people who hadn\u2019t voted reported they didn\u2019t have an easy way to get to the polls, according to Emily Gibbs, Lime\u2019s senior manager of social impact programs and a veteran in the civic engagement world having previously served as managing director of Headcount.org. Lime To The Polls was launched in 2018 to attack challenges of accessibility and affordability, she explained. Lyft claims to have helped more than 3 million people since it started working in this field in 2014. It too cites research showing the tremendous impact access to transportation can make. \u201cA study by professors from Harvard University and Boston University found that \u201c66% of voters with access to a car voted in the 2018 general election, compared to only 36% who did not, a 30 percentage point gap,\u201d shared a May Lyft press release describing 2024 plans for the Lyft Up Voting Access Program. Lime estimates it has helped support over 90K rides to and from the polls for both local and national elections across over 200 international markets \u2014 and the company expects to substantially increase that this year because it has grown significantly and this is such a big election.

Both of these mobility companies have multifaceted plans to work with partners to encourage civic engagement and provide free and/or discounted rides to the polls. For Lyft highlights include: Offering discounted rides to the polls on Election Day (November 5, 2024) across the country. Donating free or heavily discounted ride codes to nonprofit partners whose communities traditionally face barriers getting to the polls. Helping riders, drivers, and team members register, prepare to vote, and understand voting ID requirements, with partners like When We All Vote, the League of Women Voters, and VoteRiders. Making it easy for Lyft employees to volunteer as poll workers via Power the Polls. Partnering with Levi Strauss & Co. and Showtime/MTV to form a new coalition aimed at closing the voting gap for community college students. For Lime highlights include: Lime has a lot planned for its 2024 Lime To The Polls initiative Lime Launching a major \u201cregister to vote\u201d campaign in late June aimed at its customers via in-app messaging Fielding a major effort around National Voter Registration Day (September 17) by working with a wide array of nonprofit partners to whom it will provide messaging, free ride and other forms of support Providing free rides (up to 30 minutes) to and from the polls from Vote Early Day (October 29) through Election Day that will be promoted via various forms of messaging on Lime and nonprofit partner channels. Providing Lime staff time off to vote All of this adds up to \u201cdemystifying the process\u201d so more people get out to vote in this and other elections, said Gibbs. \u201cWe show up at the midterms, we show up at local elections, we show up at other times as well, because we think that all of those elections are really important.\u201d \u201cEvery American citizen should be able to exercise their right to vote without Lyft CEO David Risher says the company is committed to a nonpartisan civic engagement campaign to ... [+] get voters to the polls this year. Lyft worrying about the cost or difficulty of getting to the polls,\u201d said David Risher, Lyft CEO in a press release. \u201cEveryone \u2014 from a driver who's given a thousand rides to a rider who hasn\u2019t taken her first one yet \u2014 deserves to have their voice heard at the polls.\u201d Follow me on Twitter.

He said the United States would never relent in tracking down terrorist suspects and holding them to account for their actions.\n\nHe said \"terrorists around the world should know that the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc", "id": "67"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc", "id": "151106"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "type": "loc", "id": "216558"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302727", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303051", "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303218", "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303326", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303577", "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303585", "label": {"eng": "Sidewalk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303629", "label": {"eng": "Muslim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla,_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303748", "label": {"eng": "La Rambla, Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304309", "label": {"eng": "General officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304453", "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305679", "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "306135", "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "307421", "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311218", "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Pershing", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "486790", "label": {"eng": "John J.

In that attack, one woman died and 19 other people were injured when a car rammed into people demonstrating against a white nationalist rally in the city.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions told ABC News on Monday that the Charlottesville attack met \"the definition of domestic terrorism.\"\n\nISIS claims responsibility for deadly Barcelona attack\n\nBarcelona attack witness saw driver 'knocking people over at high speed'\n\nFrom Panama, where he was traveling Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence expressed that \"the latest scenes of carnage and and mayhem sicken us all.\"\n\n\"Whatever inspired today's terror attack, the United States stands ready to assist the people of Spain and find and punish those responsible,\" said Pence.\n\nThe president's and vice president's comments followed remarks earlier by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who offered the U.S.'s condolences and a strong warning to others who attempt to instigate attacks.\n\n\"Terrorists around the world should know the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,\" said Tillerson.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Panama"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Panama"}, "type": "loc", "id": "173"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc", "id": "151106"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302557", "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303659", "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304736", "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304965", "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305919", "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319789", "label": {"eng": "Spanish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "323536", "label": {"eng": "Al Gore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homegrown_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "348655", "label": {"eng": "Domestic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sessions", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "379557", "label": {"eng": "Jeff Sessions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "394340", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "532783", "label": {"eng": "Rex Tillerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1055799", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Hebdo shooting"}}]}

A van driver yesterday ploughed into crowds of pedestrians on Barcelona's most popular street in broad daylight. \"The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!\" Trump said in a tweet yesterday.\n\nIn another tweet, he referred to an American general for taking tough attitude towards terrorists. \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more radical Islamic terror for 35 years!\"\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence described this as a tragic day and warned the perpetrators of the terrorist attack. \"This latest attack, the worst terror attack on Spanish soil since the 2004 Madrid train bombings, shows us again that radical Islamic terrorism is one of the greatest threats that we face in the world ... Whoever is responsible should know that the US, together with our allies, will find and punish those responsible, and drive the evil of radical Islamic terror from the face of the earth,\" he said.\n\nRead | Barcelona terror attack live updates: Spanish police kill four 'suspected terrorists', thwart second attack\n\nPence said this at a joint press conference with the president of Panama where he is travelling now. \"This is a tragic day, and the latest scenes of carnage and mayhem sicken us all...People in Barcelona should know, our prayers and the prayers of all of the American people, are with the victims and their families, and all the good people of Spain,\" he said.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the US is monitoring the situation and the country is ready to assist law enforcement and national security authorities in Spain. \"Our consulates in Barcelona and our entire Mission Spain team are currently assisting Americans in Spain who are affected by these events. We ask US citizens in the area to let your loved ones know you are safe. Terrorists around the world should know the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic leader Nancy Pelosi said all Americans are horrified and saddened by the news of the vicious terror attack in Barcelona. \"Terrorists will not break our strength or our spirit. While we wait for further news, may the people of Barcelona know that the United States stands in solidarity with them at this dark hour. The US will continue to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with Spain against the vile scourge of terror,\" she said.\n\nIt's horrific to again see graphic images of innocent victims hit by a car that was driven by hate, Senator Dianne Feinstein said. \"This attack is yet another reminder that we must do more to combat all forms of extremism. Terrorists need to be identified and stopped before they are able to commit an attack,\" she said.\n\nCondemning the attack, Congressman Eliot Engel, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said: \"In the days ahead, the United States will stand with our ally as authorities investigate what happened and work to bring all those responsible to justice.\" \"The brutal and cowardly attack on innocent people at Las Ramblas today is a reminder that we are all obligated to stand against violence and hatred wherever it lives,\" said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\n\"The perpetrators of this heinous attack must be brought to justice, and we will not rest until the purveyors of hate and terror around the world are defeated,\" said the House Democratic Whip Steny H Hoyer. Two suspects of the deadly attack, identified as a Spaniard and a Moroccan, have been arrested but the driver is still on the run.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App",

A van driver yesterday ploughed into crowds of pedestrians on Barcelona's most popular street in broad daylight. \"The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!\" Trump said in a tweet yesterday. In another tweet, he referred to an American general for taking tough attitude towards terrorists. \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more radical Islamic terror for 35 years!\" US Vice President Mike Pence described this as a tragic day and warned the perpetrators of the terrorist attack. \"This latest attack, the worst terror attack on Spanish soil since the 2004 Madrid train bombings, shows us again that radical Islamic terrorism is one of the greatest threats that we face in the world ... Whoever is responsible should know that the US, together with our allies, will find and punish those responsible, and drive the evil of radical Islamic terror from the face of the earth,\" he said.\n\nPence said this at a joint press conference with the president of Panama where he is travelling now. \"This is a tragic day, and the latest scenes of carnage and mayhem sicken us all...People in Barcelona should know, our prayers and the prayers of all of the American people, are with the victims and their families, and all the good people of Spain,\" he said. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the US is monitoring the situation and the country is ready to assist law enforcement and national security authorities in Spain. \"Our consulates in Barcelona and our entire Mission Spain team are currently assisting Americans in Spain who are affected by these events. We ask US citizens in the area to let your loved ones know you are safe.

While we wait for further news, may the people of Barcelona know that the United States stands in solidarity with them at this dark hour. The US will continue to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with Spain against the vile scourge of terror,\" she said. It's horrific to again see graphic images of innocent victims hit by a car that was driven by hate, Senator Dianne Feinstein said. \"This attack is yet another reminder that we must do more to combat all forms of extremism.\n\nTerrorists need to be identified and stopped before they are able to commit an attack,\" she said. Condemning the attack, Congressman Eliot Engel, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said: \"In the days ahead, the United States will stand with our ally as authorities investigate what happened and work to bring all those responsible to justice.\" \"The brutal and cowardly attack on innocent people at Las Ramblas today is a reminder that we are all obligated to stand against violence and hatred wherever it lives,\" said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. \"The perpetrators of this heinous attack must be brought to justice, and we will not rest until the purveyors of hate and terror around the world are defeated,\" said the House Democratic Whip Steny H Hoyer.

The courts must give us back our protective rights. Have to be tough!' Trump tweeted.\n\nOn Thursday as news reports filtered in and the Barcelona death toll grew, Trump issued a standard message of support on Twitter.\n\n'The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!' the president said.\n\nBut in a similar shift toward underscoring the role of radical Islam in the deadly events, he urged Americans to '[s]tudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!'\n\nThat was a reference to a discredited anecdote that described Pershing executing 49 of 50 Muslim prisoners in the Philippines - with bullets dipped in pig's blood - before telling the lone survivor to spread the tale as a terrorism deterrent.\n\nThursday's attack claimed at least 14 lives and left more than 100 injured. ISIS, the dreaded Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, claimed responsibility.\n\nTrump has never shied away from using 'radical Islamic terrorism' as a rationale for pushing his stern border control prescriptions.\n\nShortly after proposing in late January that people from seven Muslim-majority countries should be barred entry to the United States, he tweeted: 'The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real, just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East.

Terrorists need to be identified and stopped before they are able to commit an attack,\" she said.\n\nCondemning the attack, Congressman Eliot Engel, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said: \"In the days ahead, the United States will stand with our ally as authorities investigate what happened and work to bring all those responsible to justice.\"\n\n\"The brutal and cowardly attack on innocent people at Las Ramblas today is a reminder that we are all obligated to stand against violence and hatred wherever it lives,\" said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\n\"The perpetrators of this heinous attack must be brought to justice, and we will not rest until the purveyors of hate and terror around the world are defeated,\" said the House Democratic Whip Steny H

It burst through the crowd at high speed, leaving bodies laying motionless in its wake.\n\n\"All of sudden it was real chaos,\" witness Ethan Spibey told Sky News, \"People just started running screaming, there were loud bangs. People just started running into shops, there was a kind of mini-stampede where we were, down one of the alleyways.\"\n\nLocal authorities said they had found a second van linked to the attack in the small town of Vic in Catalonia. Police have cordoned off the area and are inspecting the vehicle.\n\nThe attack mirrors those in London and Paris, where terrorists drove cars through crowded areas with the aim of inflicting mass causalities.

Spanish authorities are treating the incident as a terrorist attack and ISIS has claimed affiliation with the perpetrators but has not asserted responsibility.\n\nOn Aug. 17, a van drove through Las Ramblas, a tourist destination in Barcelona, the capital city of the Catalan province in Spain.\n\n\"I heard a crowd screaming,\" Tom Markwell, a New Orleans businessman who was on the scene, told the BBC. \"It sounded like they were screaming for a movie star.\"\n\n\"I saw the van,\" Markwell continued. \"It had already been busted on the front. It was weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground.\"\n\nTwo men have been arrested in connection with the attack.\n\nISIS' propaganda arm released a statement asserting that the two suspects were \"soldiers of the Islamic State.\"\n\nIt remains unclear whether the terrorist organization coordinated the attack, but Spanish officials have designated the incident as an act of terror.\n\nCatalan law enforcement are currently searching for any more potential suspects related to the vehicle attack. The situation is evolving and has been complicated by misinformation. Catalan officials have dismissed reports that there was a suspect who had taken a hostage.\n\nThere was an explosion at a house in Catalan shortly after the terrorist attack, resulting in one death. Catalan police believe the explosion was related to the vehicle attack, CNN reports.\n\n\"The terrorists will never defeat a united people who love freedom versus barbarism,\" tweeted Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. \"All of Spain is with the families and their victims.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump took to social media to offer support.\n\n\"The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help,\" Trump tweeted. \"Be tough & strong, we love you!\"\n\nTrump followed up with another tweet, stating, \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nThe president's second tweet appeared to reference a factually disputed story he had described during the 2016 presidential race. On the campaign trail, Trump asserted that Gen. John Pershing had purged Islamist extremism in the Philippines by massacring 50 suspected terrorists with bullets dipped in pig's blood in the early 20th century, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact found there is little historical evidence to support Trump's story.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama also took to social media to offer his condolences to the people of Spain.\n\n\"Michelle and I are thinking of the victims and their families in Barcelona,\" Obama tweeted. \"Americans will always stand with our Spanish friends.

(AP) -- With college sports on the verge of sweeping change that could have long-term financial implications, two private investment firms have created a platform to help athletic departments find funding.\n\nRedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital announced Wednesday the creation of Collegiate Athletic Solutions, which is trying to cash in on a college sports landscape that's facing significant upheaval.\n\nThe NCAA and its member schools are expected to vote on a proposed $2.77 billion settlement of an antitrust lawsuit this week, one that could leave schools with tighter budgets, or in some cases financial hardships, in the coming years.\n\nCAS would be available to lend money and offer guidance to athletic departments in exchange for a share of future revenue.\n\n\"The paradigm shift we are seeing in the collegiate athletics ecosystem is similar to the ones we've seen with media distribution models, collective bargaining rights and premium hospitality,\" said Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of RedBird Capital in New York. \"They're all centered around the need to create long-term growth by bridging the gap between premium (intellectual property) and optimizing revenue streams.\n\n\"CAS addresses athletic departments' need for near-term capital with additional operational expertise across strategies that can improve competitive positioning.\"\n\nWeatherford Capital is headquartered in Tampa, Florida, and run by brothers Will, Sam and Drew Weatherford. Drew Weatherford played football at Florida State and is a member of the school's board of trustees.\n\nFSU has been negotiating for more than a year with another investment firm, private equity giant Sixth Street, on a potential capital infusion for the Seminoles.\n\n\"We are in the late stages of the competitive divide between athletic departments and programs,\" Weatherford said. \"The impact of conference re-alignment, diverging media rights deals, and the advent of NIL and revenue sharing is creating a greater financial divide at both the university and conference level.\n\n\"History has proven that the universities that adeptly invest in their athletic departments consistently win and outpace peer institutions. Our mission at CAS is to offer athletic departments a unique capital solution to invest when and where they need it to compete at the highest level during this tenuous paradigm shift.\"\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Most of them unfold in similar fashion. Gregarious and charming with a sweeping white smile, Weatherford, the former FSU quarterback-turned-private capital investor, presents a slide deck detailing a project that he and co-partner Gerry Cardinale of RedBird Capital Partners launched last year.\n\nTheir goal is quite simple: Infuse instant cash into major college athletic departments.\n\n\"No school has said, 'No, that is not something we would consider,'\" Weatherford said.\n\nIn one of the most consequential weeks in college athletics history, with leaders on the brink of approving a landmark antitrust case settlement and adopting a new revenue-sharing model with athletes, Weatherford is speaking publicly about his exploits for the first time. In two separate meetings with Yahoo Sports, he revealed and then explained the presentation that he showed administrators and university personnel over the last 10-12 months.\n\nWeatherford Capital and RedBird Capital Partners have combined their powers (and billions in cash) to create Collegiate Athletics Solutions, a dedicated campaign and business-building platform for investing capital in college athletic departments at the most transformational time in the industry.\n\n\"I had a hunch this revenue sharing thing was real. It is going to be another big blow to athletic departments,\" Weatherford said.\n\nCollege administrators are bracing for the new reality of sharing revenue directly with athletes as part of the terms of the House settlement agreement.\n\nWhile the NCAA and schools will pay $2.8 billion in back damages, they have also agreed to a future player revenue-sharing model with a quasi-salary cap of as much as $22 million annually per school. Most power conference leaders are expecting to spend as much as $30 million in new revenue annually when considering the revenue-sharing cap, plus a reduction in NCAA distribution for the back damages and the addition of new scholarships in a model that, to some degree, removes financial aid limitations.\n\nThat's $300 million in new money over the duration of the 10-year settlement term. It's why, over the last two weeks especially, Weatherford's phone has buzzed more than normal.\n\nIn a timely move last week, RedBird Capital added $4.7 billion to its arsenal for new endeavors, according to the Wall Street Journal, putting the firm at what is believed to be $10 billion in equity.\n\nAs part of the Collegiate Athletics Solutions platform, Weatherford and Cardinale are seeking five to 10 programs to invest in as little as $50 million and as much as $200 million. They are in \"deep conversations\" with a \"handful\" of programs, though Weatherford declined to identify or discuss specific schools.\n\nAt least three power conference school athletic directors confirmed to Yahoo Sports that they have spoken deeply with Weatherford and Cardinale about a partnership. They declined to reveal their identity as the deals have not been finalized.\n\n\"If you want to compete at this level, private equity and capital is really important,\" one athletic director said. \"I've been talking to these people for 10-12 months. I haven't pulled the trigger. But is this what you are going to need to be successful and survive? Yes, it is.\"\n\nPrivate equity and private capital is nothing new to sports.\n\nIn fact, RedBird acquired Italian soccer giant AC Milan for $1.3 billion in 2022 and has stakes in Formula One's Alpine and the Fenway Sports Group, owners of the Boston Red Sox and English soccer team Liverpool. RedBird's independent content studio, EverWonder, is operating the new in-season, eight-team men's college basketball tournament based in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving weekend. The tournament is expected to pay participating teams up to $2 million in NIL deals.\n\nThese ventures aren't completely rare in the world of higher education either. But in college athletics, it has been wholly unusual. The words private and equity together spook some. Many scowl at the thought of athletic departments -- originally meant to be a university's non-profit marketing and entertainment entity -- giving away control of a portion of itself for fast cash.\n\nWeatherford describes Collegiate Athletics Solutions (CAS) as \"private capital,\" not equity. There is no ownership here, he says. Schools have the freedom to be flexible with the $50-$200 million lump sum. It is meant to be spent with existing other capitals -- think traditional debt, booster donations and bonds -- to offset expenses such as athlete revenue sharing, coaching salaries and facilities improvements. But the freedom is theirs.\n\nThe CAS project does not require a management role inside the athletic department as private equity often does, he said, though they would aim to be advisors to presidents and athletic directors in managing revenue growth.\n\nAfter all, they do have an incentive to see increases in a department's revenue: They earn a percentage on any new annual growth. Over a 10- to 20-year period, that percentage decreases from, perhaps, 22% in the first few years to 2% by its end, as the firm meets its original principal investment. Weatherford describes this as taking a \"revenue royalty.\"\n\nIf there is no growth, the firm does not take a cut.\n\n\"They are not mandated to pay us back the money we give them,\" Weatherford said.\n\nThese capital firms are built around investing wisely in revenue-generating entities. Why take a risk on the unstable situation in college sports if you aren't guaranteed a profit?\n\n\"I deeply personally believe in college athletics,\" Weatherford said. \"As an ex-athlete, I owe a lot to it and so does my family. We believe in college athletics. I don't like the fact that 10 to 15 teams have a chance to win a national title every year. I'd like that to be 40-50. It's not a level playing field. Not everyone has the resources to compete.\"\n\nNew revenue streams are more important than ever for college athletic departments that, through the years, have saved little to no money in reserves.\n\nMost athletic departments use profit from their one true revenue-generating sport (football) to subsidize the rest of the department. That means funding money-losing Olympic sports and paying for football expenses.\n\nOver the years, fueled by multi-million dollar television contracts, athletic departments at the highest level became flush with cash. Unable to directly compensate athletes and situated in a competitive environment, departments pumped the excess cash into gaudy facility projects and million-dollar coaching and administrative salaries in an effort to compete with their rivals on the recruiting trail.\n\nThis result? Many schools are hampered with significant debt that continues to expand as the arms race for facility upgrades and coaching salaries plods onward -- until, perhaps, now. Schools will be permitted -- not required -- to pay athletes directly. The facilities arms race is quickly evolving into one solely focused on compensating athletes.\n\n\"Every school that I talk to says they have to max out on revenue sharing or they are no longer going to be competitive and run the risk of being relegated out of their conference,\" Weatherford said. \"They need to generate more revenue. And the truth is, a lot of their access to capital is strained. They've raised a lot of their debt for facilities. They've taken on debt, raised gobs of money from donors to build the facilities and I'm not going to say that there is no more room left, but they're getting to the brink of being exhausted.\"\n\nBut many still question the need for private equity or capital within college sports. University board members and school presidents, while more warming to the idea, are naturally hesitant. So, too, are the most powerful leaders in the sport.\n\n\"What could private equity do that schools can't with their donors?\" asks outgoing American Athletic commissioner Mike Aresco. \"Another question ... Does private equity align with your goals? I question its role in college athletic departments.\"\n\nIn an interview last month, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey brushed aside an insinuation that private equity is a savior of sorts for the industry. \"If you use the clich\u00e9, 'If I was buying stock, I'd buy stock in college sports,'\" he said. \"Well, apparently there are a lot of people who believe that outside of college sports, something is going right.\"\n\nHowever, the impending revenue-sharing model has administrators searching for cash. The new model is expected to take effect starting next academic year, in the fall of 2025. Fourteen months to come up with upwards of $30 million isn't easy.\n\nFor those in the Big Ten and SEC, the task isn't as difficult. Over the next few years, more than $25 million in new television and College Football Playoff monies are on the way for each of those members.\n\nIn the ACC and Big 12, things are more tricky.\n\nIn fact, one ACC school may be further along than others in the hunt for private money. Florida State and athletic director Michael Alford are believed to be seriously exploring such a path, with multi-million dollars in figures emerging from public records obtained by Sportico and the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nWhile Weatherford sits on the FSU Board of Trustees, he is not involved with the Seminoles' private equity venture, he said. However, perhaps in the not-too-distant future, Collegiate Athletics Solutions, or some other entity, will cut a giant check to an athletic department near you.\n\n\"It's basically like going and taking out a loan and repaying it over 15-20 years,\" said another power conference athletic director. \"Here's the thing: How desperate are you? Because you've got to pay off that note.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The goal of Drew Weatherford, who's met with around 50 FBS programs, wants to simply infuse instant cash.\n\nWeatherford, a former Florida State quarterback turned into a private capital investor, has a project with co-partner Gerry Cardinale of RedBird Capital Partners launched last year.\n\n\"Weatherford Capital and RedBird Capital Partners have combined their powers (and billions in cash) to create Collegiate Athletics Solutions, a dedicated campaign and business-building platform for investing capital in college athletic departments at the most transformational time in the industry,\" Dellenger wrote.\n\nWeatherford opened about the revenue sharing model, which is on the brink of being approved across college athletics.\n\n\"I had a hunch this revenue sharing thing was real. It is going to be another big blow to athletic departments,\" Weatherford said, via Yahoo Sports.\n\nHow does that look exactly and where does Weatherford fit in? Dellenger explained.\n\n\"While the NCAA and schools will pay $2.8 billion in back damages, they have also agreed to a future player revenue-sharing model with a quasi-salary cap of as much as $22 million annually per school,\" Dellenger wrote. \"Most power conference leaders are expecting to spend as much as $30 million in new revenue annually when considering the revenue-sharing cap, plus a reduction in NCAA distribution for the back damages and the addition of new scholarships in a model that, to some degree, removes financial aid limitations.\"\n\nIn short, that's $300 million over the duration of the 10-year settlement term. Now, Weatherford is preparing to send money to athletic departments who are ready to invest.\n\n\"As part of the Collegiate Athletics Solutions platform, Weatherford and Cardinale are seeking five to 10 programs to invest in as little as $50 million and as much as $200 million,\" Dellenger wrote. \"They are in 'deep conversations' with a 'handful' of programs, though Weatherford declined to identify or discuss specific schools.\n\n\"At least three power conference school athletic directors confirmed to Yahoo Sports that they have spoken deeply with Weatherford and Cardinale about a partnership. They declined to reveal their identity as the deals have not been finalized.\"\n\nBefore you get left in the dust, athletic departments are going to have to make this type of move, according to an unnamed AD.\n\n\"If you want to compete at this level, private equity and capital is really important,\" one athletic director said to Yahoo Sports. \"I've been talking to these people for 10-12 months. I haven't pulled the trigger. But is this what you are going to need to be successful and survive? Yes, it is.\"\n\nWeather described Collegiate Athletic Solutions as \"private capital\" and not equity. With no exact ownership, athletic departments would have the freedom to be flexible with a $50 to $200 million lump sum.\n\n\"It is meant to be spent with existing other capitals -- think traditional debt, booster donations and bonds -- to offset expenses such as athlete revenue sharing, coaching salaries and facilities improvements,\" Dellenger wrote. \"But the freedom is theirs.\"\n\nAs far as financial growth within the athletic department, the school is now required to pay Weatherford and crew back if they don't see growth, per the report.\n\n\"I deeply personally believe in college athletics,\" Weatherford said to Yahoo. \"As an ex-athlete, I owe a lot to it and so does my family. We believe in college athletics. I don't like the fact that 10 to 15 teams have a chance to win a national title every year. I'd like that to be 40-50. It's not a level playing field. Not everyone has the resources to compete.\"\n\nThe biggest concern for athletic departments is using football to subsidize the rest of the sports, which keeps money-losing Olympic sports afloat. With the addition of multi-billion dollar television contracts, athletic departments received quite the share.\n\nHowever, that money wasn't funneled directly to the student athletes, so athletic departments pivoted to big-time facility projects, coaching salaries and administration roles to compete with the biggest rivals.\n\nThat leads to significant debt as the arms race continues across the biggest schools.\n\n\"Every school that I talk to says they have to max out on revenue sharing or they are no longer going to be competitive and run the risk of being relegated out of their conference,\" Weatherford said. \"They need to generate more revenue. And the truth is, a lot of their access to capital is strained. They've raised a lot of their debt for facilities.\n\n\"They've taken on debt, raised gobs of money from donors to build the facilities and I'm not going to say that there is no more room left, but they're getting to the brink of being exhausted.\"\n\nWhile people like AAC commissioner Mike Aresco quesino the need for private equity, and SEC's Greg Sankey brushing it aside, Dellenger revealed the reality of searching for cash.\n\n\"However, the impending revenue-sharing model has administrators searching for cash,\" Dellenger wrote. \"The new model is expected to take effect starting next academic year, in the fall of 2025. Fourteen months to come up with upwards of $30 million isn't easy.\n\n\"For those in the Big Ten and SEC, the task isn't as difficult. Over the next few years, more than $25 million in new television and College Football Playoff monies are on the way for each of those members. In the ACC and Big 12, things are more tricky.\"\n\nWeatherford, a former FSU quarterback, is on the school's board of trustees but isn't involved in the private equity venture at the university. But, Collegiate Athletic Solutions, or some other entity, can certainly cut a giant check in the near future.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_kosko@on3.com", "name": "Nick Kosko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_sharing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Revenue sharing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weatherford,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weatherford, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Weatherford, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Five_conferences", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Power Five conferences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Private equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Weatherford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Weatherford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletic director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Sankey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Sankey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_athlete", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Student athlete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Athletic_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Athletic Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Governing_Bodies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Governing Bodies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/22072545/USATSI_22888034-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589872", "eventUri": "eng-9589872", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

The structure of CAS, according to multiple people familiar with its plan, is to lend upfront money and operational expertise to athletic departments in exchange for a share of additional revenue generated under their partnership.\n\nWeatherford Capital, headquartered in Tampa, Fla., is run by brothers Will, Sam and Drew Weatherford, the latter of whom played football at Florida State and is a member of the school's board of trustees. FSU has been negotiating for more than a year with another investment firm, private equity giant Sixth Street, on a potential capital infusion for the Seminoles. A spokesman for Weatherford said FSU is aware of his work with CAS and that he would recuse himself from decisions involving private capital and Seminoles athletics. The university's spokespeople did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nCAS, meanwhile, is raising money and is already in talks with a number of other universities, said the people, who were granted anonymity because the details are private. The new venture plans to initially partner with five to 10 athletic departments, offering $50 million to $200 million to each.\n\nRepresentatives for RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital declined to comment.\n\nCAS is one of a number of institutional funds looking to finance and profit off the increased commercialization of college sports. Legal, financial and legislative upheaval has combined to create \"one of the most potentially transformative opportunities I've witnessed in my 30-year career in sports,\" Cardinale wrote in an introductory email to Texas Tech athletic director Kirby Hocutt late last year.\n\n\"We have done a tremendous amount of work to position ourselves as a thoughtful impact partner for you and your team as you evaluate the changing landscape,\" he said later in the email, which Sportico obtained via an open records request. \"Drawing on both (a) our collective experience of building cutting edge sports businesses (e.g., On Location, OneTeam Partners, and Legends Hospitality) to generate more revenue for your department and (b) our expertise in partnering/operating teams and leagues (e.g., AC Milan, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, XFL, etc.), we should be a fairly unique partner to programs like yours.\"\n\nBoth Weatherford and Cardinale have been at least vaguely telegraphing the premise behind their new venture for months. Last August, Weatherford posted a column on LinkedIn titled, \"Amateur Collegiate Sports is Dead...Act Accordingly,\" in which he argued that instead of \"rest(ing) on the laurels of the traditions\" of what college sports once was, the industry's stakeholders should \"celebrate\" the \"multibillion-dollar national treasure\" it has become and \"commercialize the asset\" for their benefit.\n\nIn early January, Cardinale told the The New York Times that Michigan's football team might be worth $1.5 billion and implied that the Wolverines were an undervalued asset. The week prior, on Jan. 2, a Delaware LLC called Collegiate Athletic Solutions Platform was formed, according to the state's Division of Corporations database. The CAS website is currently password protected with a landing page that says \"coming soon.\"\n\nThe company has one employee publicly listed on LinkedIn -- Newman Delany, the son of former Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany, who is identified as a senior vice president. Jim Delany is currently an advisor to the Big Ten as well as a partner at The Montag Group. The Delany family has also been a significant donor to the University of North Carolina, both Jim and Newman's alma mater.\n\nIn a March email sent to Texas Tech's Hocutt, Newman Delany requested a number of different pieces of financial information for CAS to develop a \"tangible TTU-specific analysis as the foundation for a constructive discussion.\"\n\nThat data included three years of itemized profit-and-loss statements from the athletic department; three to five years of itemized profit-and-loss projections; details on any future revenue pledged to existing projects or liabilities; a detailed breakdown of debt obligations; and a finance schedule for upcoming capital expenditures, including ROI estimates for those projects.\n\nIn response, Hocutt sent an email to deputy athletic director Jonathan Botros, the Red Raiders' CFO and COO, asking if he had \"concern in sharing this type of general information.\" A Texas Tech spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry about the current status of these talks.\n\nCAS' approach is different from traditional private equity, or even private credit. The group does not plan to take an equity position in any athletic department's commercial venture, nor does it intend to secure fixed payments in return for the upfront capital.

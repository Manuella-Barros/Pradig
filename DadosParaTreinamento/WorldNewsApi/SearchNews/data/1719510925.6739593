{"id": 223707988, "title": "Martin Brundle divides F1 fans after \"bullying\" his way into Virgil van Dijk interview", "text": "Formula 1 fans were left divided after Martin Brundle interrupted another broadcaster's interview with Virgil van Dijk to speak to the Liverpool defender himself. It was the second time Brundle had tried to grab a word with Van Dijk on his grid walk before the Monaco Grand Prix. A few minutes earlier, he was asked to wait as the Dutch defender was posing for photos with other guests. In the meantime, he went to speak with actress Alexandra Daddario. And once that conversation was over, he returned to Van Dijk to find that a Dutch reporter from Viaplay had already grabbed the footballer for a word. But Brundle wasn't waiting around any longer. He interrupted that conversation and told his media colleague: \"Sorry, I'm in the queue like the cheese counter. How's it going? A quick word and I'll get out of your way.\" Brundle then asked Van Dijk if it was his first time on the grid, with the Liverpool captain responding: \"Yeah, it's a really nice experience. It was always going to be a special experience coming here because this is a whole event, but I'm very happy to be here. \"I don't know how they cope with all the attention not even an hour before the race. It's crazy, but massive respect. Let's see what kind of spectacle the race will bring.\" Brundle then apologised to the Dutch reporter, before leaving him to speak to Van Dijk. And fans were left divided by the interview, with one writing: \"The most British thing I have seen Martin Brundle do on an F1 grid walk.... Trying to speak to Virgil Van Dijk and saying \"there's a queue!\" to the Dutch interviewer who jumped in. So funny!\" Another added: \"Hahahaha Martin Brundle booting that reporter away from Van Dijk.\" A third wrote: \"Martin Brundle is a menace First he tells MBappe security 'Its alright mate I'm in charge around here' refusing to not get a word and then bullying the other reporter is hilarious to just say 'I'm in the queue like the cheese counter' to ask Van Dijk questions\". A fourth added: \"Did Martin Brundle seriously just interrupt someone else's interview with Van Dijk just to get in there himself and kick that other interview out? He seriously has no concept of boundaries. Also - If someone says no, it means no. Utterly cringing to watch\". Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

And it was not in the back of the head, as it has been speculated.'\n\nMiller, 30, was found dead at Lumbee River State Park, North Carolina, on April 27\n\nWeeks prior, she shared a video speaking about abuse within marriage and her family claimed her husband (pictured) had harassed her and she was 'afraid for her life'\n\nWeeks before she died Mica posted an emotional video in which she spoke of abuse within marriage and offered support to 'ANYONE struggling with leaving a dangerous situation because they think God will be 'mad' at them.'\n\nShe said: 'Today my heart's a little heavy. I've had lots of women that have reached out to me about situations of abuse, and I just want to tell you what a lot of people have told me lately, because I think I forgot.\n\n'But you are the bride of Christ before anybody else's, male or female, it doesn't matter what gender you are, abuse is abuse.'\n\nAfter her death, Myrtle Beach pastor Miller stunned his congregation at Solid Rock at Market Common Church in South Carolina when announced that his wife had died and that her death was 'self-induced.'\n\nHe then told worshippers that he would be taking 'a little break' and to leave the church without discussing what he had just told them.\n\nIn the days since Mica's death on April 27, her family had pushed back at her husband's explanation of it as suicide.\n\nMica Miller offered her support to victims of abuse and reminded them that they 'don't have to stay' in an emotional Facebook video shared on March 22\n\nMiller urged her friends and followers to share her message with anyone struggling to reconcile their faith with their abusive relationships\n\nDailyMail.com has learned that Mica's untimely death on April 27 came just 48 hours after she served her husband, Pastor John-Paul Miller, with divorce papers\n\nSpeaking to DailyMail.com last week, Mica's sister Sierra Brown, 28, said that the family wasn't making any statements until the investigation was complete but pointed out: 'The one thing I would say is that he has said it was an official suicide, that is not the case. There's still an open investigation.'\n\nMica was found with a fatal gunshot wound in Lumbee River State Park, North Carolina, in a death that is under investigation by Robeson County Sheriff's department.\n\nMica's death came just 48 hours after her husband, from whom she had been separated for one month, was served with divorce papers.\n\nCourt records hint at the tumult within the marriage with Mica first filing for divorce back in October 2023 before withdrawing the filing February 12.\n\nLater that same month Miller filed against his wife for Separate Support and Maintenance in a motion withdrawn March 11.\n\nBut on April 15, just 12 days before she was found dead, Mica filed once more and, according to friends, also sought a no contact order against her husband.\n\nSpeaking March 22 Mica said: 'You don't have to stay in an abusive relationship. Whether that's sexual, whether that's somebody forcing you to take illegal drugs or alcohol abuse, or physical abuse, psychological abuse, making you think that this is all your fault or that you're a bad mom or a bad husband or you're not giving it your all when you know you are.\n\nJohn-Paul Miller shocked his congregation when he announced her death as a suicide at the end of a service at Solid Rock at Market Common Church in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina last Sunday\n\nMica was discovered with a fatal gunshot wound on April 27 in Lumbee River State Park, North Carolina\n\n'God hates divorce, but why? According to everybody that I've asked and the scriptures I've seen it's because it hurts people. But does abuse hurt people. How do you think God feels about that?'\n\nMica met Miller, 14 years her senior, when she was just 14 years old and a member of his church youth group.\n\nAddressing his congregation Miller stated that Mica, stepmother to his five children, 'was mentally unwell.'\n\nBut friends have taken to social media to refute this statement with one posting on X: 'Mica is a close friend of mine, she 100% would not have committed suicide. She was excited to start a new life no longer living in fear of him & was finally on her way out.'\n\nIn Mica's obituary penned by Miller, who has a criminal record including multiple counts of aggravated assault and battery to which he pleaded guilty, makes no mention of the fact that the couple had separated.\n\nInstead, he described her as a 'great stepmother, and an amazing wife and helpmate', and portrayed her as his biggest cheerleader.\n\nKenn Young, Mica's friend, is among those searching for answers over what happened.\n\n'This has to be at least looked into deeply. There's got to be some accountability here,' he told WPDE. 'Because yeah, a tragic life was lost, and it's not just as simple as mental health issues.'\n\nMiller's sisters have also alluded to questions around her death, making posts with the caption '#JusticeforMica.'\n\n'There is a lot of talk already going on so I want to set the record straight. Our sister Mica Miller passed away yesterday,' Miller's sister Sierra Francis wrote.\n\n'Please do not listen to false stories being shared about her. Mica was a God-fearing, joyful, loving woman.\n\nMica's sister Sierra, seen above in Facebook video, told DailyMail.com the family is not commenting publicly until the investigation is completed but confirmed her official cause of death has not yet been determined\n\nBut the lack of information from the police has led many including Millers sisters (pictured) to question what happened\n\n'We know that so many of you feel this gut-wrenching loss with us. The fight is not over.'\n\nMiller originally hails from Wichita, Kansas, as one of five children, according to her obituary.\n\nCourt filings indicate she had served her husband with divorce papers just weeks before her death.\n\nThe pastor's obituary describes her as, 'energetic, affirming, adventurous, faithful, loving, giving, forgiving, talented, joyous, creative, assertive, bold, determined, authoritative, passionate, hardworking, a risk taker, and so much more.'\n\nIn an interview with ABC15, Miller's husband reiterated that his wife had taken her own life.\n\n'She had struggled with suicide before,' he said. 'Each time we would help her through it and take her to the doctor, and we got through it and everything was fine.\n\n'She even gave a few testimonies here at church that we have on video. She battled suicide but God took care of her and got her through it.'\n\nHe added she was 'probably the greatest wife anyone could ask for' and described nights spent talking to each other for hours.\n\nA celebration of Miller's life is scheduled to take place on Sunday.\n\nMajor Damien McLean with the Robeson County Sheriff's Office said his team is still working on the case. At this stage, there is nothing to suggest a threat to the wider community, he said.\n\nMcLean added his office plans to release more information in the next few days.\n\nDailyMail.com has contacted

Her husband insists he loved his wife, and despite all his care and support for her, she died by suicide because she suffered from serious mental illness with which she had been grappling for years.\n\nFrancis, in her affidavit, rejected the narrative presented by Pastor Miller at his church two Sundays ago.\n\n\"My sister was hopeful for her future after filing for divorce from John-Paul,\" Francis wrote in the affidavit.\n\n\"My sister also expressed to me that she was fearful that she would not make it to the divorce and that her life would be taken from her. It is my belief, based on conversations with my sister, that she told multiple people, including other family members,\" Francis explained.\n\n\"Mica stated to me on many occasions 'if I end up with a bullet in my head, it was not by me, it was JP.' Mica forwarded a family group text message notifying us that Mr. Miller was served the divorce papers on April 25, 2024,\" Francis added. \"On April 27, 2024, my sister, Mica A. Miller, was found dead as a result of a gunshot wound in Lumberton, North Carolina.\"\n\nIn a separate affidavit supporting Francis' application to serve as special administrator, Mica Miller's brother, Nathaniel Francis, who was a member of Solid Rock at Market Common, said his late sister also confided in him about her marital struggles.\n\nNathaniel Francis noted in his affidavit that was also shared on X by Protestia, that he left Solid Rock at Market Common after several years there \"due to the behaviors I observed.\"\n\nHe said shortly before her death, Mica Miller reported to police that she was being viciously stalked by her estranged husband.\n\n\"Mica made several police reports over the last few weeks of her tires being slashed and tracking devices found on her car. In Mr. Miller's email forwarded to me, he apologizes to Mica for the tires and causing damage to her vehicle,\" Nathaniel Francis wrote.\n\n\"Mr. Miller's email to my sister continued to state that he was angry when Mica confided or 'put her family before' him and that made him want to hurt her. In his words 'when someone hurts me, I try to hurt them back rather than forgive.' And instead of me forgiving you...I just attack and try to cause pain.'\"\n\nWhen contacted by The Christian Post for comment on Monday, the Rev. Charles Randall, Pastor Miller's spiritual advisor and mentor, who previously told CP that the allegations against him were \"lies,\" did not respond.\n\nA notice sent to church members on Sunday indicated that Pastor Miller had been released from all ministerial duties at the church \"for a time of healing, counsel, and guidance, pursuant to our governing instrument,\" according to ABC 15.\n\nThe Robeson County Sheriff's Office, which is investigating the death of Mica Miller, also did not provide any additional updates on her death Monday beyond that they are continuing their investigation.\n\nTwo reports from the Horry County Police Department dated March 11 confirmed suspicious stalking claims on that date, ABC 15 reported.\n\nAccording to one of the reports, Mica Miller told police a razor blade had been placed in her tire at the Springmaid Pier. She said it was the second time she had experienced a tire being deflated in that manner in a week. The responding officer said the metal was a tire deflation device that could be bought online.\n\nMica Miller named a suspect in the report whose name was redacted. She also expressed concern that she was being watched or followed, but the police stated they didn't have enough evidence to prove the suspect had placed the razor device under her tire.\n\nThe story, however, did not end there. Mica Miller was forced to call the police again later that same day while she was at the East Coast Honda dealership. She told police that after another officer helped her change her tire, she stopped at a gas station on her way to the dealership and was approached by the unidentified suspect. She indicated that she didn't wish to talk and attempted to record the suspect with her phone, but the suspect drove off.\n\nPolice further acknowledged that Miller informed them that a mechanic had found a tracking device on her car. While she was at a local court office to get a restraining order against the suspect, police reported that the suspect drove by slowly in a white Honda.\n\n\"Mica told me on numerous occasions that she feared John-Paul and just wanted to escape him,\" Nathaniel Francis said in the affidavit shared by Protestia.\n\nSierra Francis explained that she and her sister spoke \"every few days\" and would meet in person \"at least once a month.\"\n\n\"I know my sister to have expressed the abuse and violence against her by her husband to others including family members and members of the church congregation,\" she said. \"Mica told me that there were people following her, keeping track of where she went. She thought that Mr. Miller hired people to follow her. Mr. Miller later confirmed this during a sermon I watched.\"\n\nPastor Miller told CP last Friday that his wife was diagnosed with \"bipolar II, schizophrenic and dependent personality disorder\" and had struggled with mental illness for the entirety of their marriage, which began in 2017. He said she was being treated with lithium but did not always want to take her medication which made life difficult to the point where she would try to take her own life.\n\n\"I took care of her through every time she went to the mental institute. I took care of her every time she stopped taking her lithium. I would never expose this stuff of her if I didn't have to now, but every time she tried to kill herself, I would be there. I would literally sometimes pick her up physically, put her in the truck, take her to the [hospital],\" Miller said with a slight crack in his voice.\n\nSierra Francis claimed in the affidavit, however, that Pastor Miller's abuse of her sister contributed to her mental decline.\n\n\"In February 2024, Mr. Miller removed my sister's personal items from the home they shared while she was admitted to Waccamaw Mental Health facility and left them at the apartment of Dianna Niosi. My sister was not aware that her personal possessions had been removed from her residence until she was released from the hospital,\" Sierra Francis said in the affidavit.\n\n\"Prior to her admission to Waccamaw, Mica was gathering and sorting the evidence she had to bring to an attorney for filing for divorce, to support her claims against Mr. Miller, and as to his abuse, character, his paramours, and associates he 'paid off' or blackmailed,\" she added.\n\n\"While at the facility, those documents, emails, files, etc., were removed from her phone, personal laptop, vehicle, and purse and never recovered. Further, Mica was unable to access her iCloud account, email, or Facebook profile. Mr. Miller continued using at least one of Mica's accounts, causing any recipient to believe it was Mica's communications.\"\n\nSierra Francis said her sister had big plans to move to Kenya to do missionary work and get her life back after the divorce she was planning from Pastor Miller.\n\nPastor Miller told CP, however, that he has video evidence of his wife testifying to how she previously tried to shoot herself in the head.\n\nBefore the pastor could explain to CP last Friday how he believes his wife ended up dead in Lumber River State Park in Robeson County, he was advised by his attorney not to make any further public comments about her passing.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Friends have indicated she had no known ties to the area - and no known reason to be an hour away from home.\n\nFirst reported by this media outlet last Thursday, Miller's death quickly became an international story thanks to the bizarre way in which her husband, pastor John-Paul \"JP\" Miller of the Solid Rock at Market Common church in Myrtle Beach, chose to announce it to parishioners.\n\nAt the conclusion of a full-length, upbeat sermon last Sunday (April 28, 2024), Miller asked his congregation to stand for an announcement -- giving his parishioners strict instructions not to discuss the forthcoming news amongst themselves.\n\n(Click to View)\n\n\"I got a call late last night my wife has passed away,\" Miller said. \"Yeah.

These allegations were detailed in a court filing submitted by Mica Miller's family seeking control over her estate.\n\nAs we previously reported, just prior to her death - on April 15, 2024 - Mica Miller filed for divorce from her husband. As we reported, JP Miller was served these papers on April 25, 2024 -- two days prior to her death. The hearing relating to this filing had been scheduled for June 5, 2024 in front of S.C. family court judge Jan Bromell Holmes. At that hearing, Miller's attorneys hoped to obtain an order which would restrain John-Paul Miller from disposing of, encumbering, transferring, selling, hypothecating, pledging, destroying or otherwise altering the status or value of any marital asset.\n\nAffidavits filed in support of the court filing from Mica Miller's family portrayed her as a woman in fear for her life - telling her sister she feared \"she would not make it to the divorce and that her life would be taken from her.\"\n\n\"If I end up with a bullet in my head, it was not by me, it was JP,\" she said, according to her sister.\n\nThis is a developing story ... please check back for updates.\n\nWill Folks is the founding editor of the news outlet you are currently reading.

(WBTW) -- A Myrtle Beach woman found dead last week in Robeson County had a tracking device placed on her car that was discovered after she took it to a dealership to repair a tire that had been slashed, according to Horry County police reports.\n\nMica Miller, 30, made two complaints on March 11 -- the first coming after her vehicle's tire was found slashed near Springmaid Pier, the report said. The second complaint, filed hours later, came after Miller took her vehicle to East Coast Honda on Highway 17 Bypass to have the tire repaired.\n\nThe police reports indicate that the suspect in both incidents was a male.\n\nMiller's husband John-Paul Miller is the senior pastor at Solid Rock Church in Market Common. The church's website is currently suspended.\n\nMiller's body was found on April 27 at Lumber River State Park. An official cause of death has yet to be released. Sheriff Burnis Wilkins told News13 in an email on Monday that he expects a report to be available on Tuesday.\n\n\"We have Detectives in SC now and plan to have the findings of our full investigation as it relates to the death of Mica Miller available tomorrow,\" Wilkins said.\n\nNews13 has also asked for a copy of Miller's death certificate and other documents from the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner but has not received them.\n\nAccording to the police reports, Miller first contacted officers at about 1:20 a.m. on March 11 to report one of her tires had been slashed. Officers met her at a Margarita Drive address.\n\nMiller told officers that \"this is the second time a razor has deflated her tire in the last week,\" the report states. Miller said she was leaving Springmaid Pier when she \"heard a pop and noticed that a piece of metal was protruding from her tire.\"\n\nBy the time she got to Margarita Drive, the tire was fully deflated. The officer \"observed the tire and upon removal of the metal piece it was found that the metal was a tire deflation device that can be purchased online,\" according to the reports.\n\nThe suspect's identity is redacted in both reports, but Miller said she \"noticed strange activity and what she believes as people following or watching her.\" Miller also told officers that the suspect \"has a history of similar actions against her.\"\n\nPolice said there was not enough evidence to charge anyone in the tire-slashing incident. Then, just before noon on March 11, an Horry County police officer went to East Coast Honda to investigate a harassment complaint.\n\nMiller told him that another officer had helped change her tire and that she then headed to a gas station before going to East Coast Honda.\n\nWhile getting fuel, \"the suspect in this incident showed up next to her at the pump trying to talk to her,\" the report said. \"She told him to go away she does not want to talk and then when she pulled her out to record he sped off.\"\n\nAs Miller was talking to the officer at the dealership, the report said she received a call from the suspect using a \"No ID\" number. \"The suspect was advised that the victim does not want any further contact and if he proceeds then warrants may possibly be written up.\"\n\n\"The victim advised me she was afraid for her life,\" the officer wrote in the report. \"She also advised she blocks his numbers and still gets calls and texts from him on other numbers.\"\n\nAfter the officer left, the report said a mechanic discovered the tracking device on Miller's vehicle. She then headed to court \"trying to get a restraining order.\" Miller handed the GPS device over to police outside the courthouse.\n\n\"While I was standing out front of the magistrates office with the victim a white in color Honda Accord slow rolled down Scipio Lane in front of the magistrates office,\" the officer wrote.\n\nMiller said the suspect was driving her car. The vehicle \"sped up and drove off,\" the report ends.", "source": {"uri": "counton2.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCBD 2 - Charleston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dennis_bright@counton2.com",

Her husband insists he loved his wife, and despite all his care and support for her, she died by suicide because she suffered from serious mental illness with which she had been grappling for years.\n\nFrancis, in her affidavit, rejected the narrative presented by Pastor Miller at his church two Sundays ago.\n\n\"My sister was hopeful for her future after filing for divorce from John-Paul,\" Francis wrote in the affidavit.\n\n\"My sister also expressed to me that she was fearful that she would not make it to the divorce and that her life would be taken from her. It is my belief, based on conversations with my sister, that she told multiple people, including other family members,\" Francis explained.\n\n\"Mica stated to me on many occasions 'if I end up with a bullet in my head, it was not by me, it was JP.' Mica forwarded a family group text message notifying us that Mr. Miller was served the divorce papers on April 25, 2024,\" Francis added. \"On April 27, 2024, my sister, Mica A. Miller, was found dead as a result of a gunshot wound in Lumberton, North Carolina.\"\n\nIn a separate affidavit supporting Francis' application to serve as special administrator, Mica Miller's brother, Nathaniel Francis, who was a member of Solid Rock at Market Common, said his late sister also confided in him about her marital struggles.\n\nNathaniel Francis noted in his affidavit that was also shared on X by Protestia, that he left Solid Rock at Market Common after several years there \"due to the behaviors I observed.\"\n\nHe said shortly before her death, Mica Miller reported to police that she was being viciously stalked by her estranged husband.\n\n\"Mica made several police reports over the last few weeks of her tires being slashed and tracking devices found on her car. In Mr. Miller's email forwarded to me, he apologizes to Mica for the tires and causing damage to her vehicle,\" Nathaniel Francis wrote.\n\n\"Mr. Miller's email to my sister continued to state that he was angry when Mica confided or 'put her family before' him and that made him want to hurt her. In his words 'when someone hurts me, I try to hurt them back rather than forgive.' And instead of me forgiving you...I just attack and try to cause pain.'\"\n\nWhen contacted by The Christian Post for comment on Monday, the Rev. Charles Randall, Pastor Miller's spiritual advisor and mentor, who previously told CP that the allegations against him were \"lies,\" did not respond.\n\nA notice sent to church members on Sunday indicated that Pastor Miller had been released from all ministerial duties at the church \"for a time of healing, counsel, and guidance, pursuant to our governing instrument,\" according to ABC 15.\n\nThe Robeson County Sheriff's Office, which is investigating the death of Mica Miller, also did not provide any additional updates on her death Monday beyond that they are continuing their investigation.\n\nTwo reports from the Horry County Police Department dated March 11 confirmed suspicious stalking claims on that date, ABC 15 reported.\n\nAccording to one of the reports, Mica Miller told police a razor blade had been placed in her tire at the Springmaid Pier. She said it was the second time she had experienced a tire being deflated in that manner in a week. The responding officer said the metal was a tire deflation device that could be bought online.\n\nMica Miller named a suspect in the report whose name was redacted. She also expressed concern that she was being watched or followed, but the police stated they didn't have enough evidence to prove the suspect had placed the razor device under her tire.\n\nThe story, however, did not end there. Mica Miller was forced to call the police again later that same day while she was at the East Coast Honda dealership. She told police that after another officer helped her change her tire, she stopped at a gas station on her way to the dealership and was approached by the unidentified suspect. She indicated that she didn't wish to talk and attempted to record the suspect with her phone, but the suspect drove off.\n\nPolice further acknowledged that Miller informed them that a mechanic had found a tracking device on her car. While she was at a local court office to get a restraining order against the suspect, police reported that the suspect drove by slowly in a white Honda.\n\n\"Mica told me on numerous occasions that she feared John-Paul and just wanted to escape him,\" Nathaniel Francis said in the affidavit shared by Protestia.\n\nSierra Francis explained that she and her sister spoke \"every few days\" and would meet in person \"at least once a month.\"\n\n\"I know my sister to have expressed the abuse and violence against her by her husband to others including family members and members of the church congregation,\" she said. \"Mica told me that there were people following her, keeping track of where she went. She thought that Mr. Miller hired people to follow her. Mr. Miller later confirmed this during a sermon I watched.\"\n\nPastor Miller told CP last Friday that his wife was diagnosed with \"bipolar II, schizophrenic and dependent personality disorder\" and had struggled with mental illness for the entirety of their marriage, which began in 2017. He said she was being treated with lithium but did not always want to take her medication which made life difficult to the point where she would try to take her own life.\n\n\"I took care of her through every time she went to the mental institute. I took care of her every time she stopped taking her lithium. I would never expose this stuff of her if I didn't have to now, but every time she tried to kill herself, I would be there. I would literally sometimes pick her up physically, put her in the truck, take her to the [hospital],\" Miller said with a slight crack in his voice.\n\nSierra Francis claimed in the affidavit, however, that Pastor Miller's abuse of her sister contributed to her mental decline.\n\n\"In February 2024, Mr. Miller removed my sister's personal items from the home they shared while she was admitted to Waccamaw Mental Health facility and left them at the apartment of Dianna Niosi. My sister was not aware that her personal possessions had been removed from her residence until she was released from the hospital,\" Sierra Francis said in the affidavit.\n\n\"Prior to her admission to Waccamaw, Mica was gathering and sorting the evidence she had to bring to an attorney for filing for divorce, to support her claims against Mr. Miller, and as to his abuse, character, his paramours, and associates he 'paid off' or blackmailed,\" she added.\n\n\"While at the facility, those documents, emails, files, etc., were removed from her phone, personal laptop, vehicle, and purse and never recovered. Further, Mica was unable to access her iCloud account, email, or Facebook profile. Mr. Miller continued using at least one of Mica's accounts, causing any recipient to believe it was Mica's communications.\"\n\nSierra Francis said her sister had big plans to move to Kenya to do missionary work and get her life back after the divorce she was planning from Pastor Miller.\n\nPastor Miller told CP, however, that he has video evidence of his wife testifying to how she previously tried to shoot herself in the head.\n\nBefore the pastor could explain to CP last Friday how he believes his wife ended up dead in Lumber River State Park in Robeson County, he was advised by his attorney not to make any further public comments about her passing.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

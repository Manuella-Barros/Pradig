When we heard the ordeal, our eyes filled with tears and at the same time our blood was boiling. We were angry as the Samajwadi Party has stood with the person who has committed such a heinous crime,\" Bind told PTI after meeting the girl and her family members.\n\nShe added that the rape survivor's father has died, and that the mother, a labourer, is taking care of her three daughters and a son.\n\n\"We also came to know that the crime has been committed by the 'nagar adhyaksh' (city unit president) of the Samajwadi Party, and there was another person involved in this case who used to make videos and blackmail her. After speaking to some villagers, it was revealed that the SP's 'nagar adhyaksh' had committed similar crimes earlier as well,\" Bind alleged.\n\nBJP leaders, including Chief Minister Adityanath, have alleged that Moid Khan, the prime accused in the gangrape case of the girl, is a member of the SP and part of the team of Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad.\n\nBind also said Adityanath is with the girl and her family and assured that the culprits will be punished.\n\nReferring to demolition of accused's \"illegal\" property here, Bind also said that Adityanath is giving a message that strict action would be taken against the accused in such crimes.\n\nShe also said that the SP workers are indulged in criminal activities in the state, but the Adityanath government will not allow them to flourish.\n\nThe BJP delegation that met the girl's family also comprised Rajya Sabha MP Baburam Nishad and UP's Minister of State (Independent Charge) Backward Class Welfare Narendra Kashyap.\n\nThe delegation gathered information about the incident from the rape survivor's family members, and will submit a report on the matter to K Laxman, the national president of the BJP's OBC Morcha, Nishad said after the meeting.\n\nPolice on July 30 arrested Moid, who would run a bakery in Bhadarsa Nagar of Ayodhya district, and his employee Raju Khan, in connection with the minor's rape.\n\nAccording to police, Moid and Raju had raped the girl two months ago and also recorded the act. The incident came to light after the girl was found to be pregnant in a medical checkup.\n\n\"This is a case of Ayodhya. Moid Khan is from SP and is a member of the Ayodhya MP's team. He has been found involved in the rape of a 12-year-old girl. The Samajwadi Party has not taken any action against him,\" Adityanath had said in the UP Assembly on Thursday.\n\nThe chief minister had met the girl's family last week.\n\nThe Ayodhya district administration demolished Khan's \"illegal\" bakery on Saturday.

We gathered information about the accused as well. We will get to the bottom of the case,\" said Mr. Nishad. The BJP has continuously targeted the main Opposition party in the State - Samajwadi Party (SP) - over the incident since the main accused Moid Khan is being linked to the party and is said to be a supporter of SP's Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad. Ayodhya is part of the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya yet again alleged that SP president Akhilesh Yadav is only worried about his vote bank and criticised his earlier calls for a DNA test of the accused. \"Shri. Akhilesh Yadav, a pawn of the Congress, first forgot his PDA [Pichda, Dalit and Alpsankhyak or Backwards, Dalits and Minorities] voters by bringing in 'DNA'. You are worried about your vote bank getting angry. People of the State expect the culprit to be punished and justice provided to the victim. The government will fulfil its responsibility,\" wrote Mr. Maurya on X.\n\nMr. Yadav had earlier said: \"The guilty should be punished, but if allegations are proven false after a DNA test, then the government officials involved should also not be spared.\"\n\nOn the line of fire, the SP hit back saying \"malicious intent of certain individuals to politicise such incidents would never succeed\" and requested courts to take suo motu cognisance. \"The government should arrange the best possible medical treatment for the rape victim. It is the government's responsibility to protect the girl's life. It is my humble request to the honourable courts to take suo motu cognisance and considering the sensitivity and seriousness of the situation, ensure safety of the victim under its supervision. The conspiracy of ill-intentioned people to politicise such incidents should never succeed,\" Mr. Yadav said.\n\nThe Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) also waded into the issue with its State chief Vishwanath Pal alleging that \"a few persons\" are pressurising the mother of the Ayodhya rape victim to withdraw complaint and reach a compromise. Mr. Pal said the victim's mother had informed the BSP delegation of such actions during its visit to her home on Saturday.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangeeta_Balwant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sangeeta Balwant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faizabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faizabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Faizabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keshav_Prasad_Maurya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keshav Prasad Maurya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maurya Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahujan_Samaj_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bahujan Samaj Party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/biuljs/article68485839.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI08_04_2024_000336B.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789916", "eventUri": "eng-9789916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

The Revenue Department has since identified about half a dozen illegal properties belonging to Khan.\n\nAdditionally, the Yogi government has taken action against illegal construction at Khan's bakery, with a bulldozer demolishing these unauthorized structures.\n\nIt is anticipated that further demolition of Khan's other properties may follow. Moreover, a case has been filed against three individuals, including the chairman of Bhadarsha Nagar Panchayat, for threatening the victim and her family.\n\nRepresentatives of the Nishad community who came to thank the Chief Minister for the assistance provided to the rape victim and her family included Mahant Ramsevak Das Nishad, Anju Nishad, Durga Prasad Nishad, Sandeep Nishad, Manjeet Nishad, Asharam Nishad, and Vishnu Nishad.\n\nMeanwhile, following the meeting with the Nishad community delegation in Ayodhya, the Chief Minister emphasized that the safety of the victim and her family is the government's top priority.\n\nOn the social media platform X, he stated, \"Today, a social delegation met with us in Shri Ayodhya Dham regarding the minor victim from the Bhadarsa area. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring justice for the victim in every circumstance.\n\nThe safety of the victim and her family remains our highest priority. Our government stands with the victim's family with utmost dedication and sensitivity. The strictest action will be taken against the culprits of this incident, which has brought shame to humanity.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Adityanath", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yogi Adityanath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhadarsa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bhadarsa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhadarsa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faizabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faizabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Faizabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yogi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagar_panchayat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nagar panchayat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vishnu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Durga"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-2024-05-27T153149.565.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789916", "eventUri": "eng-9789916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Other leaders have contrasted the Yogi Adityanath administration's alacrity in the case with its inaction in several other rape cases and suggested this had to do with Khan's religious identity.\n\nThe girl's family has alleged intimidation by local SP leaders not to pursue the matter, following which a case has been lodged against Mohammad Rashid, chairman of the Bhadarsa Nagar panchayat, and local politician Jay Singh Rana.\n\n\"We told them (the girl's family) not to fear anybody,\" Kashyap, minister of state for backward classes welfare, said.\n\nThe delegation handed over a cheque for Rs 5 lakh to the girl. The state government announced the compensation two days ago.\n\nKashyap accused the Samajwadis of \"doing politics instead of helping the victim\".\n\nKhan and Raju allegedly raped the girl three months ago, shot a video and blackmailed her. Her mother learnt about it two months ago when the girl, the youngest of four, became pregnant.\n\nThe mother alleges the police sided with the accused until Ram Sewak Das, a local BJP leader, took the matter up and filed a case against Khan and Raju. The duo were arrested on July 30, and two police officers were later suspended for dereliction of duty.\n\nOn August 2, Das got the mother to meet Adityanath and complain about Samajwadi pressure to withdraw the case. A day later, Khan's bakery in the Purakalandar area, where the girl was allegedly gang-raped, was demolished.\n\nSamajwadi district president Paras Nath Yadav demanded the \"harshest punishment\" for the accused if proved guilty.\n\n\"We too want to meet the victim and help her, but do not dare go there: the state government may file a false case accusing us of intimidating her,\" he said.\n\nHe asked: \"Why was similar action not taken in many other rape and murder cases in the state?\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "piyush_srivastava@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Piyush Srivastava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moin_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moin Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Kumar_Kashyap", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Kumar Kashyap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhadarsa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhadarsa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhadarsa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gang rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Adityanath", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yogi Adityanath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagar_panchayat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nagar panchayat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2024/Aug/1722824974_new-project-2024-08-05t053924-150.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789916", "eventUri": "eng-9789916", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1806, "textEnd": 1813}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 1889, "textEnd": 1897}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

If the rapist is a Muslim, then the entire Saifai family [SP leadership] puts its weight behind saving him,\" the Deputy CM had alleged.\n\nThe BJP sent a three-member party delegation comprising OBC leaders and Rajya Sabha MPs Baburam Nishad and Sangeeta Balwant Bind, and U.P. Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Backward Class Welfare Narendra Kashyap on Sunday to meet the family members of the girl. The team will submit its fact-finding report to BJP OBC Morcha chief K.

A stage costume from her Reputation Tour, complete with snake microphone, is in the British Gallery.\n\n\"The V&A feels like the perfect stage for a Taylor Swift trail,\" Bailey said. \"I think there's so many touchpoints within Taylor's work that respond to art, literature, history. ... There's so many ways that we can kind of interpret and layer and present Taylor's work here.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Taylor Swift: Songbook Trail presents 13 moments from across the 34-year-old musician's career. Rather than contain them in a single exhibition, the pieces - from tour attire to instantly recognisable outfits from Swift's album art and videos and even a fake beard - are spread across the entire footprint of the museum, engaging with the permanent collections.\n\n\"It's the first time we've done this kind of theatrical installation for a contemporary artist,\" said curator Kate Bailey. Organising it entailed plenty of other firsts: \"I've never displayed a microphone before,\" she said - not least one adorned with a gold serpent, as designed for Swift's 2018 Reputation tour.\n\nThe exhibition came together unusually fast, said Bailey, conceived in response to \"this summer moment of Taylor Swift being in the UK\" on the Eras tour - which ran in June and returns for a final London stint in August: \"It felt like something we could make happen across the museum because of the nature of the chapters of her career and the way Taylor works with curiosity and Easter eggs.\" While thousands of fans were unable to score pricey Eras tickets, the V&A exhibition is free, and intended to engage younger visitors with their collections. Displaying items such as microphones and instruments, said Bailey, fit the V&A's emphasis on the power of creativity. \"I feel very passionate about bringing that in. She's a songwriter. This is the guitar. This is all it takes - some imagination, some talent - and you can go wherever.\"\n\nPitching to Swift's team was \"a very creative, straightforward process\", said Bailey, with pieces drawn from Swift's personal archive (Swift herself was not personally involved). \"It's very encouraging that she has an archive because not all artists keep their stuff and look after it so brilliantly, but she does, and we were given great access.\" She described the exhibition as \"very poetic and literary as opposed to bombastic like Wembley will be - it's a very different journey through chapters.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning, as technicians made final touches, Bailey stood before a tableau centred on Swift's 2019 album Lover. Against the Valhalla mosaics, all by male artists, Swift's drag outfit, fake facial hair and director's chair from her self-directed video for The Man - plus her MTV Video Music award for direction - stood flanked by sculptures of Venus and Diana. \"It's quite playful and speaks to the patriarchal presentation of the male artist and Taylor's relationship with the patriarchy,\" said Bailey.\n\nA mixture of stage costumes and lesser-seen outfits gave the exhibition \"a combination of intimacy and spectacle\", she said. \"I presented it as feeling like she's just left the room, which feels true to the way that she communicates with fans.\" A whistle-stop dash through the museum took in two battle-worn stage outfits from the 1989 tour, still wrapped in protective paper, and the dress from the cover of Speak Now (Taylor's Version) displayed in the gilded music room of Norfolk House.\n\nThe cardigan worn in the video for Cardigan, from Swift's 2020 lockdown album Folklore, was draped over a piano stool. \"Having a mannequin didn't feel right,\" said Bailey. \"It's more expressive on the stool - there's the sense that she's been here, as if it's about to come to life.\" The piano itself was covered in real moss (made safely fire-retardant, another first for the museum) and softly playing birdsong to echo that album's woodsy aesthetic. Next door, the dress from the Willow music video - from Folklore's 2020 sister album, Evermore - contrasted with Francis Danby's Disappointed Love and other \"Victorian genre paintings telling stories through art\", said Bailey. \"It almost feels like she lived in those galleries to create the music.\"\n\nBailey was particularly taken with the black vegan leather Victoriana dress from the video to this year's single Fortnight, from the album The Tortured Poets Department, which provides a dramatic conclusion to the museum trail. \"You think, why did she choose an 1890s dress as opposed to an 1870s dress?\" she wondered aloud. \"The 1890s are a really distinct moment for the beginning of the emancipation of women, they're starting to get more jobs; the typewriters in the video nod to more roles for women.\"\n\nBailey curated last year's Diva exhibition at the V&A, and in the programme notes, cited French critic Th\u00e9ophile Gautier's characterisation of the diva as \"'thrice gifted', a perfect fusion of music, words and image\". Does Swift count as a diva?\n\nRelated: Hooked: How crochet became fashion's hottest trend\n\n\"Each generation redefines the diva and she is a pioneer on so many levels, whether that's with her songwriting, the re-recording, her images and aesthetics,\" said Bailey. What's different, she said, was that \"you can't separate her from the fandom. Divas are worshipped, but with Swift that relationship is a dialogue. It's more embracing - people feel like she's in their bedroom with them.\" (The V&A's recently hired Swiftie superfans, however, weren't part of putting together this show.)\n\nAnd in contrast to how many pop superstars use persona - such as David Bowie, subject of a 2013 V&A show - \"you always see Taylor Swift\" in her outfits, said Bailey. \"That's really powerful and authentic, whether you're looking at the country debut and her cowboy boots or any other era, it's still absolutely Taylor.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

So, many, many things.\"\n\nThe exhibit is not the first museum treatment of Swift. Last summer, the Museum of Arts and Design (MAD) in New York City presented \"Taylor Swift: Storyteller,\" featuring a different array of costumes and objects spanning her career.\n\nDie-hard Swifties may recognize items in a display case dating back to an early tour in 2007 when she was a supporting act: pale blue heart-adorned cowboy boots, turquoise dress and a Taylor acoustic guitar made of koa wood.\n\nA guitar and stage costume from previous concert tours are displayed at the 'Taylor Swift Songbook Trail Exhibition' at the Victoria & Albert Museum, on Wednesday, July 24, 2024 in London. (Photo by Scott A Garfitt/Invision/AP)\n\nThe exhibits are set among priceless works in a museum that houses collections of art, fashion, photography, furniture, performance, architecture, and ceramics.\n\nA purple skirt and pink and green sequined jacket from the 2015 tour of her Grammy-winning 1989 album are in a case next to a painting by the High Renaissance artist Raphael. A sweater from the \"Cardigan\" video from her \"folklore\" album sits in front of a piano in a gallery of landscape paintings.\n\nThe Cinderella-like yellow gown from the \"Bejewelled\" music video from the \"Midnights\" album is displayed in the Prince Consort Gallery. A stage costume from her Reputation Tour, complete with snake microphone, is in the British Gallery.\n\n\"The V&A feels like the perfect stage for a Taylor Swift trail,\" Bailey said. \"I think there\u00b4s so many touchpoints within Taylor\u00b4s work that respond to art, literature, history. ... There\u00b4s so many ways that we can kind of interpret and layer and present Taylor\u00b4s work here.\"\n\nExhibit pieces from previous concert tour at the 'Taylor Swift Songbook Trail Exhibition' at the Victoria & Albert Museum, on Wednesday, July 24, 2024 in London.

'The items are in dialogue with this bed and this mirror and it just looks beautiful.'\n\nHowever, that insight is not offered to the average swiftie reading, as the information sign simply tells you about the album and the 'shift in approach' for Taylor.\n\nAs a Speak Now girlie, spotting the ballerina-style back cover dress for Taylor's Version was a highlight as fans aren't usually able to clearly see the intricate details.\n\nThe gown - with glass crystal beading around the bust and soft pastel pink and purple skirt - was paired with her actual ukulele from the 2011 tour in a simple room.\n\n'Speak Now is the first Taylor Swift album to be completely self-written, featuring sons that with \"brutal honest and unfiltered diaristic confessions and wild wistfulness\" detail her transition into adulthood,' the sign next to the dress reads.\n\nIt added: 'As a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and singer Taylor Swift is at the helm of her creative output. This ukulele was used on the Speak Now World Tour.'\n\nThis is the one gaping flaw in the V&A exhibit: As a fan of Taylor, I walked away knowing nothing more than I did walking in.\n\nBeyond some details on the materials used or the brands, there was no extra information about inspirations or stories which would have allowed me into the Eras world further.\n\nThe idea is when fans descend on the capital for her final Wembley gigs in August, they can also take a turn around the historic museum and see some of her iconic looks.\n\nDie-hard fans will love it simply because they are getting to see Taylor's outfits in the flesh (or the fabric) while casual viewers may be interested to learn about items like the folklore cardigan which is also on display.\n\nThose of us sitting in the middle with good knowledge and a hunger to discover more might feel a bit short-changed, especially if you're making the trip specifically for the exhibition.\n\nMaybe it got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much, but I can't help but think that even though the exhibition is a masterpiece, the V&A really missed a trick here.\n\nThe Taylor Swift Songbook Trail is open at the V&A from Saturday 27 July 2024 to Sunday 8 September 2024.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page -

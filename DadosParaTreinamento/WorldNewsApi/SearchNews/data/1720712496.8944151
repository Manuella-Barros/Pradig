Whether it be for weddings, a spa day or a luxury weekend away with the other half, it\u2019s often the go-to spot for many across NI looking to treat themselves for a night or two. Myself and my better half wanted to do just that to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, and given that neither of us had ever been through the doors of the place, thought we would give it a go.

For dinner at the resort there are a few options, most of which are on site, Gillies Grill and Fratelli are two of the most popular, but unfortunately were booked up by the time I went to reserve a table. Forward planning has never been one of my strong points. Nevertheless we had had a few recommendations from friends that the off-site Castle Kitchen and Bar, located at the nearby golf resort, was as good, if not better than the alternatives. When you stay at the hotel, they kindly offer a free transfer service for the five minute journey to the Castle, which slightly resembled a vengabus with a few giddy couples and girl gangs after a pre-dinner cocktail or two. On arrival we were well looked after by the staff and shown to a nice booth overlooking the course and presented with menus for food and drinks. The menus are actually quite similar to that of Gillies Grill in the main resort itself, and you would imagine they use the same suppliers so much of what\u2019s on offer will be the same across the two venues. For starters we shared their house focaccia and a portavogie prawn dish with garlic butter and herbs. The focaccia wasn\u2019t really a focaccia and if there was any garlic butter on the prawns you certainly couldn\u2019t taste it. So not a great start, but things certainly improved when it came to the main courses. I got a rump of Mourne lamb which was cooked perfectly pink, and came with a separate piece of crispy lamb shoulder, battered almost in the form of a croquette. Served with courgette, mushroom and potato rosti and lathered in a herby green sauce, everything went perfectly well together and was presented beautifully. The other half had the pan seared halibut, which came with cauliflower, potato dumpling and a bisque, which was so good it could have been served as a drink. Washed down with a bottle of Malbec and a cocktail each to finish, it was a really enjoyable meal and we could have stayed and sampled a few more of the funky cocktail menu, but the vengabus back to the resort awaited. While the experience was certainly a pleasant one all round and we didn\u2019t mind treating ourselves for the occasion, as with most things associated with the Galgorm, I would say it is overpriced. Our total bill came to \u00a3142 for two starters, two mains, a bottle of wine and two cocktails. I\u2019ve been to more expensive restaurants here in NI, but I would argue they were miles ahead of the Castle Kitchen in terms of value. So well worth a visit if you\u2019re staying at the Galgorm, but make sure to bring the wallet with you\u2026 For all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "Whether it be for weddings, a spa day or a luxury weekend away with the other half, it\u2019s often the go-to spot for many across NI looking to treat themselves", "url": "https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/review-prices-fit-king-galgorms-29315227", "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article29315270.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IMG-20240607-WA0018.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:04:34", "author": "Conor Coyle", "authors": ["Conor Coyle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.499}

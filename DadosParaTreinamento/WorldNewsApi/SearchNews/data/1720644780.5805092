The 100% Redress Party candidate says tomorrow\u2019s count will tell all. The overall message going to government today is that defective blocks are the defining issue in Inishowen. \u201cWe need a voice in Lifford that will speak up 100% for 100% redress,\u201d Ali says. The 100% redress party will have a voice for South Inishowen too, with Joy Beard tallying in second position after Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Jack Murray. Farren, the manager of Malin Head Community Centre, says the work is only beginning. \u201cWe need to be at the table to direct and help the decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be heard in Lifford. We are not going to go in and raise the roof and shout and roar, we will go in and work with the people there and hopefully deliver something better. \u201cThey will know we are here.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Ali Farren isn\u2019t celebrating just yet, but the tallies are looking like he\u2019ll be the first elected councillor on the&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/08/new-voices-for-100-redress-set-to-make-their-way-to-lifford/\">New voices for 100% Redress set to make their way to Lifford</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com\">Donegal Daily</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/08/new-voices-for-100-redress-set-to-make-their-way-to-lifford/", "image": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_7886.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:10:03", "author": "Rachel McLaughlin", "authors": ["Rachel McLaughlin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.075}

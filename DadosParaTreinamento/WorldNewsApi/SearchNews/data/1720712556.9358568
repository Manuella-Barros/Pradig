Due to the distortions often caused by Ireland's sizeable multinational sector, officials focus on modified domestic demand (MDD) to gauge the economy's strength. On an annual basis, domestic demand increased by 1.1 percent in the first quarter, the highest growth since the same quarter last year, according to the Central Statistics Office. The government forecasts domestic demand will grow by 1.9 percent for 2024 and 2.3 percent in 2025, following a growth of just 0.5 percent last year. \"As the year progresses, the increase in real incomes should further support growth in our domestic economy,\" said Minister for Finance Michael McGrath in a statement welcoming the data. Gross domestic product (GDP), used to calculate Ireland's share of activity across the eurozone, expanded by 0.9 percent in the first quarter compared to the last three months of 2023. However, GDP contracted by 6.5 percent compared to the same quarter last year, much weaker than the preliminary forecast of a 1.1 percent contraction. McGrath attributed this to \"the volatility of production in the multinational sectors.\" The government projects GDP will grow by 2.6 percent this year and 3.9 percent in 2025 after a contraction of 3.2 percent last year.", "summary": "<p>DUBLIN, Ireland: Ireland's domestic economy grew by 1.4 percent in the first three months of the year compared to the previous quarter, marking its strongest quarterly growth in almost two years, official data revealed.</p> <p>Due to the distortions often caused by Ireland's sizeable multinational sector, officials focus on modified domestic demand (MDD) to gauge the economy's strength.

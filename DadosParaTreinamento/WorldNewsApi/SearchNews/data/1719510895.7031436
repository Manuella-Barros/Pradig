The 78-lap race was immediately red flagged after Perez\u2019s Red Bull hit the barrier as the field made their way up the hill from Sainte Devote. The Red Bull was destroyed on impact with all but one of the Mexican\u2019s four wheels ripping off his car. Perez, who started 16th, walked way from the high-speed crash with debris scattered across the street track. The Mexican driver was sent into the wall after Kevin Magnussen\u2019s front-left wheel made contract with the rear-right of Perez\u2019s Red Bull. Magnussen\u2019s Haas team-mate was also taken out in the collision. \u201cThat was unnecessary,\u201d said the German driver.", "summary": "The race was immediately red flagged after Perez\u2019s Red Bull hit the barrier.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/red-bull-sergio-perez-mexican-haas-b2551772.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/26/14/25-070865753f0a4f37880ce5fa0ff07448.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:38:40", "author": "Philip Duncan", "authors": ["Philip Duncan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.331}

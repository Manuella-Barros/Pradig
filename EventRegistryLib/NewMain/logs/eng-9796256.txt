side RB Leipzig.\n\nyou have updates\n\nBarcelona have reportedly reached a verbal agreement to sign RB Leipzig attacker Dani Olmo.\n\nThe Spain international spent around seven years in the Barcelona academy before he completed a move to Dinamo Zagreb in 2014.\n\nAfter spending six years with the Croatian outfit, the 26-year-old made the switch to German club Leipzig in January 2020.\n\nOlmo has gone on to establish himself as a key player in the Leipzig side, scoring 29 goals and providing 34 assists in 148 appearances.\n\nThe Spaniard also played a starring role in Spain's Euro 2024 success, scoring three goals and providing two assists in six appearances.\n\nBarcelona agree Olmo deal\n\nHaving impressed for club and country, Olmo has emerged as one of Barcelona's main transfer targets for the summer transfer window.\n\nLeipzig boss Marco Rose recently insisted that Barcelona must meet Olmo's \"value\" after failing with their first two bids.\n\nHowever, according to journalist Fabrizio Romano, Barcelona have now reached a verbal agreement with Leipzig over a deal for Olmo.\n\nBarcelona sporting director Deco travelled to Leipzig to agree a \u20ac55m (\u00a347.4m) deal which contains a further \u20ac7m (\u00a36m) in add-ons.\n\nOlmo had given his approval prior to the agreement between the two clubs and is set to sign a six-year contract once negotiations are finalised.\n\nWhere will Olmo play at Barcelona?\n\nOlmo has travelled to Barcelona with his father Miquel Olmo and his agent Andy Bara as he closes in on a return to the Catalan giants.\n\nThe Barcelona academy product will likely compete with Pedri and Fermin Lopez for the attacking midfield spot in Hansi Flick's side.\n\nOlmo can also operate on the flanks and will add to Barcelona's current wide options of Lamine Yamal, Raphinha and Ansu Fati.\n\nThe imminent arrival will not feature in Tuesday's friendly against AC Milan, but he could be signed in time to play in the Joan Gamper Trophy match against Monaco on Monday.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, Olmo could make his competitive debut in Barcelona's La Liga opener against Valencia on August 17.\n\nbody check tags

Nou.\n\nyou have updates\n\nDani Olmo has reportedly now completed his medical tests at Barcelona, with the Spain international on the verge of joining the Catalan giants on a long-term contract.\n\nWith Barcelona seemingly forced to admit defeat in their pursuit of Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams, Olmo recently emerged as the club's leading transfer target this summer.\n\nAccording to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Barcelona have come to an agreement with RB Leipzig which will see the La Liga outfit pay \u20ac55m (\u00a347.2m) plus \u20ac7m (\u00a36m) in potential add-ons.\n\nOlmo has allegedly agreed a six-year contract at Camp Nou, and Romano claims that the attacker has now completed his Barcelona medical, with a move therefore on the verge of being confirmed.\n\nA \u20ac60m (\u00a351.5m) release clause in Olmo's Leipzig contract expired in the middle of last month, but the German outfit have always reluctantly been planning to sell him this summer.\n\nOlmo 'closing in' on move to Barcelona\n\nThe 26-year-old had his injury problems during the 2023-24 campaign but still managed to score eight goals and register five assists in 25 appearances for Leipzig in all competitions.\n\nOlmo then starred for Spain at Euro 2024, scoring three goals and registering two assists in six appearances at the competition.\n\nThe attacker did not start the tournament in the La Roja XI, but he benefitted from an injury to Pedri to become a key player for Luis de la Fuente's side in the latter stages of the competition.\n\nOlmo scored against Georgia, Germany and France in the knockout rounds and then played the full 90 minutes of the final against England in the middle of last month, which Spain won 2-1.\n\nOlmo 'set' to secure emotional Camp Nou return\n\nThe Spaniard joined Barcelona's youth academy at the age of nine and represented the Catalan team between 2007 and 2014 before deciding to join Dinamo Zagreb at the age of 16.\n\nOlmo was unable to make the breakthrough into the Barcelona first team earlier in his career, but he will now seemingly have the chance to become a star for the Catalan giants.\n\nAfter leaving Barcelona, he scored 34 goals and registered 28 assists in 124 matches for Dinamo Zagreb, with his form earning him a switch to Leipzig in January 2020.\n\nIn total, Olmo has played for his German club 148 times, scoring 29 goals and registering 34 assists, including three goals and two assists in 18 Champions League matches.\n\nThe forward could potentially make his Blaugrana debut against Monaco in the Joan Gamper Trophy fixture on August 12, with Barcelona then beginning their La Liga campaign five days later against Valencia at Mestalla.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri":

Following a missed opportunity to secure top target Nico Williams, Barcelona swiftly turned their attention to Olmo, a former La Masia graduate who has long been on their radar.\n\nDani Olmo's star rose significantly during Euro 2024, where he made a notable impact for Spain after replacing the injured Pedri. His performances only heightened the anticipation around his future, especially with the expiration of his \u20ac60 million release clause on July 20. Despite the clause's expiration, RB Leipzig maintained a stance of not obstructing Olmo's departure, particularly if he expressed a desire to move on.\n\nThe German club's willingness to negotiate was further bolstered by their successful re-signing of Xavi Simons for another season, giving them a valuable asset and some flexibility in the market. This situation set the stage for Barcelona to pursue Olmo with renewed vigour.\n\nBarcelona's pursuit of Olmo was not without its challenges. Leipzig initially rejected an opening bid, prompting Barcelona's sporting director, Deco, to take decisive action. Deco personally travelled to Germany, demonstrating Barcelona's serious intent to secure the Spanish midfielder. His efforts culminated in a lengthy meeting, where both clubs reached a consensus on the transfer terms.\n\nAccording to Romano, Barcelona agreed to pay \u20ac55 million upfront, with an additional \u20ac7 million in potential add-ons, bringing the total package to \u20ac62 million. This agreement aligns closely with the value of Olmo's previous release clause, underscoring Leipzig's firm negotiating stance.\n\nFor Olmo, the move to Barcelona marks a significant chapter in his career. The midfielder, who left Barcelona's academy at a young age, had always harboured ambitions of returning to the club. His departure years ago was motivated by a lack of clear progression to the first team, a situation that has now changed.\n\nWith a six-year contract in place, running until 2030, Olmo is set to reintegrate into a Barcelona side that has undergone considerable transformation. His desire to include a release clause in his previous contract with Leipzig was indicative of his long-term intentions.

But before they do, the club must finalise the jersey number Olmo is going to wear next season.\n\nA particularly interesting scenario could, however, unfold as Dani Olmo has a substantial chance of occupying the iconic number ten shirt next season.\n\nAlthough the number is already occupied by Ansu Fati, the forward has picked up yet another injury and faces an uncertain future at Camp Nou.\n\nShould Fati leave the club, Olmo will be free to occupy the number ten shirt. Earlier in the summer, it was reported that Barcelona were keen on maximising the economic opportunity by assigning a new number ten next season.\n\nOlmo, to that end, fits the bill perfectly. The Spaniard has ample experience and has proven himself at the highest level of football. Keeping that in mind, he is unlikely to fold under pressure as Fati once did.\n\nOlmo wore the No. 10 shirt for Spain at the UEFA Euro 2024, where he enjoyed great success.\n\nBarcelona, though, must be mindful of their past record of signing ex-La Masia graduates. The likes of Oriol Romeu and Adama Traore have failed to live up to the expectations in the past.\n\nAlthough Olmo has a considerably higher ceiling, the responsibility of becoming Barcelona's number ten could weigh on the Spaniard, which is why it is perhaps better to assess other jersey options as well.\n\nDani Olmo has donned the number seven kit in the past few years at RB Leipzig. He had worn the same number during his time at Dinamo Zagreb as well.\n\nHowever, number seven is not an option for Olmo as it is already occupied by Ferran Torres. The same applies to Olmo's other numbers such as 19 and 21, both worn during his early days with the Spanish national team.\n\nThe number 19 kit has been occupied by Lamine Yamal while Frenkie de Jong claims the number 21 shirt. Neither of them, therefore, is a viable option for Olmo.\n\nApart from these numbers, Olmo had notably worn the number 12 and 25 shirts, the latter of which was worn during his first three years at RB Leipzig.\n\nThese numbers are not occupied and are available. However, La Liga rules dictate numbers 1,13 and 25 should be reserved only for goalkeepers.\n\nThat said, Barcelona do lack a third goalkeeper, meaning the number 25 shirt could technically be available.\n\nBarcelona also have a series of other vacant jerseys left, including number 14 worn by Joao Felix last season.\n\nSergi Roberto, Romeu and Marcos Alonso's departures, meanwhile, have also made numbers 17, 18 and 20 available, though it is unlikely Olmo would consider any of them.\n\nThe coming days, therefore, could be interesting as Barcelona look to finalise a jersey number for their latest acquisition.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansu_Fati", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ansu Fati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Gamper_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joan Gamper Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Monaco_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AS Monaco FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriol_Romeu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oriol Romeu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Alonso_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcos Alonso (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferran Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergi_Roberto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergi Roberto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNK_Dinamo_Zagreb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GNK Dinamo Zagreb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/barca_universal_articles_732/a8497951b9c2b32350afa8b3cdfeb78e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796256", "eventUri": "eng-9796256", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-12", "textStart": 355, "textEnd": 364}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The Catalans have long had interest in Olmo, who was a part of La Masia from 2007 to 2014. But it seems that his great performances at the UEFA Euro 2024 is what may have convinced them to pull the trigger.\n\nLet's explore the positives and negatives of his signing.\n\nLet's get this out of the way first. Olmo is a great player. He has great skill and technique, and can pass and shoot well. He's most known for his dribbling ability but he can do a bit of everything. In short, he is fairly well rounded for an attacker. He even has the ability to contribute defensively if needed, although his best attributes are with the ball at his feet.\n\nOlmo can play both as a winger as well as an attacking midfielder. He could be deployed on the left or right or through the middle. While he is not a \"pure\" winger who can beat people with pace time and again, he's a playmaker that can create chances by dribbling or passing.\n\nEven though Olmo can play as a winger, he is not the prototypical \"chalk on the boots\" type of winger. Barcelona spent a lot of time trying to convince Nico Williams of Athletic Bilbao to sign this summer, and many pundits thought he was the perfect fit. Olmo is a very different type of player than Williams.\n\nThis isn't Olmo's fault, but it could be argued that Barcelona had other needs that will likely go unfulfilled now. Before the transfer window started, the Catalans seemed to be looking for a replacement for Sergio Busquets in the defensive midfielder role. Last season, they tried a stopgap signing in Oriol Romeu, who did not deliver as hoped. This year, they may have to make due with a cheap signing again.\n\nBorn in Catalonia and having spent 7 years in Barcelona's academy, Olmo will be a natural fit at Barcelona. He also knows a lot of their players having been a part of the Spanish national team with them. It's always tough moving to a new league, but it should be relatively easier for him.\n\nOlmo has developed a reputation for many unfortunate injuries. Over the past two seasons, he has missed 49 games over 5 different injuries dealing with knee, muscle, and joint problems. Barcelona already has many players with questionable injuries and getting a reinforcement, who himself goes down quickly, would be problematic.\n\nOlmo was arguably, although not officially, the best player at the previous Euros. He was not a starter originally, but after an injury forced Pedri off, Olmo came on and changed everything. He was a co-winner of the Golden Boot and scored two hugely important goals against Germany and France in the knockout stages. He also memorably cleared a shot off the line when England were close to equalizing in the final. Great international tournaments don't always translate to great club careers, but the potential for him to be a game-changer at the highest level exists.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Olmo's transfer fee (reported to be 62 million euro) will be a shrewd investment or not. It's certainly not a small outlay for such a player.

The Spanish club has reached an agreement with RB Leipzig for his transfer, with reliable Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano giving his patented 'Here we go'.\n\nOnce this transfer is officially announced, Olmo will be Barcelona's first high-profile signing of the summer. The Euro 2024 star is one of the best playmakers in the world when fit and would be a world-class addition to Hansi Flick's squad.\n\nThis is not Barcelona's first signing of the summer. They signed Pau Victor in a low-profile transfer from Girona but he has already established himself as a household name with his performances for the team in pre-season.\n\nOlmo is likely to be officially announced after he puts pen to paper on a contract with Barcelona and then, would link up with his teammates for training this week. As per Mundo Deportivo, the Spaniard will make his debut with Hansi Flick's team in the Joan Gamper match against AS Monaco next Monday.\n\nBefore the game, he will be presented with the first-team squad in what is a seasonal ritual ahead of the Gamper. His first joint training session is scheduled for Saturday when the US touring party links up with those who have just arrived at the Ciutat Esportiva.\n\nOlmo arrives in Barcelona at the peak of his career. He finished joint-top scorer in the recently concluded Euros and is set to play under a manager who appreciates a good playmaker in his tactical setup.\n\nThe 26-year-old is returning to a familiar surrounding where he would know a number of the players from his involvement in the Spanish national team. The likes of Ferran Torres, Pedri, Gavi, Lamine Yamal, Balde & co. should help Olmo settle in.\n\nAfter weeks of persisting, Barcelona are inching closer to a world-class signing and the fans couldn't be more excited. It'll be interesting to see what number Olmo takes at Barcelona and let's hope he has a great career ahead of him.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundo_Deportivo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mundo Deportivo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Gamper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Gamper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Monaco_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AS Monaco FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Girona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Girona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavi_(footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavi (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferran Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vem7s_NV8XvdqL3ZgeSi3g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/barca_news_network_articles_785/42e6809df1bd5a7f8ad33b88e0c8ee82", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796256", "eventUri": "eng-9796256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Agreeing personal terms on a six-year contract until 2030 hasn't been an issue.\n\nMundo Deportivo writes that Barcelona officials were working on the final details of the transfer on Thursday morning, with the hope that Olmo is officially unveiled at Friday lunchtime. At that point, he will pose for pictures in front of photographers and speak with the media.\n\nBut there is not currently thought to be a plan for a public presentation of the marquee arrival to Barca fans. Olmo's first outing is therefore more likely to be during the annual Joan Gamper Trophy match on Monday, although a separate event just for him could still be held in the days that follow.\n\nThat game, for which Monaco are this year's invited guests, would constitite an unofficial debut for Olmo. Assuming there are no hitches, his competitive debut for Barcelona could follow five days later when Hansi Flick's side travel down Spain's east coast to face Valencia in their La Liga opener.\n\nWhether Barcelona will also be able to land Nico Williams before the summer transfer window closes remains to be seen. Rumour has it that club president Joan Laporta has peronally taken over trying to negotiate with the Euro 2024-winning winger, who looks more likely to stay with Athletic Club.\n\nSpeculation is growing that the Catalans are close to complying with La Liga financial regulations and returning to 1:1 spending rules, which would be an enormous boost.

I'm really looking forward to this season.

I'm really looking forward to this season. Vamos, Athletic!\"", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng - Nigeria news."}, "authors": [{"uri": "chukwu_ikechukwu@legit.ng", "name": "Chukwu Ikechukwu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cl\u00e1sico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "El Cl\u00e1sico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphinha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansi_Flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hansi Flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletic Bilbao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luuk_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luuk de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNK_Dinamo_Zagreb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GNK Dinamo Zagreb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.legit.ng/images/1200x675/af0df36eb856f138.jpeg?v=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796256", "eventUri": "eng-9796256", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-02", "dateEnd": "-03-01", "textStart": 2088, "textEnd": 2095}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-02", "dateEnd": "-02-02", "textStart": 3007, "textEnd": 3014}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Vamos (let's go), Athletic!\"\n\nAnother reason to believe a move for Diaz is unlikely is that Barcelona wouldn't currently be able to register him.\n\nDespite agreeing a deal for Olmo, they can't even register the 26-year-old until they reduce their wage bill.\n\nThe Athletic explained: \"There is confidence at Barca that a solution to this issue can be found, with one potentially involving a new investor taking over from German company Libero within the Barca Studios project.\n\n\"However, no details of how that would work have yet been made public, and it remains to be seen whether La Liga will accept the solution proposed by (Joan) Laporta's board.\"\n\nIt hardly sounds like an ideal situation to walk into for any new signings.\n\nDespite a new head coach bringing with him unknowns for the Reds, Arne Slot's Liverpool sounds like a far more enticing place to play football!", "source": {"uri": "thisisanfield.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "This Is Anfield"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_millne@thisisanfield.com", "name": "Sam Millne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletic Bilbao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/Copy-of-Collage-3-diagonal-11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796256", "eventUri": "eng-9796256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

While the club has faced challenges securing their key targets, Nico Williams and Dani Olmo have made progress on the departure front, facilitating a more manageable squad and potentially freeing up resources for incoming transfers.\n\nBarcelona's summer has significantly focused on managing their roster and finances. The loan of Oriol Romeu to Girona marks a strategic move, reducing the squad size and possibly easing the club's wage bill. Such departures are critical as Barcelona contends with a significant financial shortfall, which must be addressed to comply with La Liga's registration rules.\n\nWith Nico Williams' decision still pending and Barcelona growing increasingly pessimistic about securing his signature, attention has intensified on RB Leipzig's Dani Olmo. Olmo, admired by both manager Hansi Flick and sporting director Deco, is seen as a vital addition who could bolster Barcelona's attacking options. The club aims to secure Olmo for less than his \u20ac60 million release clause, a negotiation complicated by Leipzig's reluctance to lower their demands.\n\nBarcelona remain under pressure to resolve a \u20ac100 million deficit to align with La Liga's financial regulations. This situation adds a layer of complexity to their transfer ambitions, as even if they succeed in signing players like Olmo, registering them in time for the season start remains a formidable challenge. However, there's confidence within the club that Olmo's strong desire to return to his boyhood club will see him remain patient during this uncertain period.\n\nWhile the attacking line remains a priority, Barcelona's scouting has also paid close attention to the midfield. The emergence of La Masia talents Marc Bernal and Marc Casado has provided new options, potentially alleviating the need to delve into the transfer market for immediate reinforcements in this area. This development could influence Barcelona's strategy, allowing them to focus financial resources on other areas of need.\n\nThe future of young striker Vitor Roque remains uncertain after failing to secure a regular first-team spot under both Xavi and Flick. The rise of Pau Victor in pre-season has further complicated Roque's position at the club. Additionally, while the board might be open to the departures of high-wage players like Frenkie de Jong, Raphinha, and Andreas Christensen, there is no immediate pressure for these players to leave, as none are actively seeking exits nor pushing for new contracts.\n\nThe current transfer window stirs a whirlwind of emotions, primarily excitement. The potential signing of Dani Olmo, a player of such calibre and connection to the club, could significantly enhance our attacking dynamics and depth. His versatility and proven ability in top-tier football make him an ideal fit for Flick's strategic vision, potentially elevating our play to new heights.\n\nDeveloping talents like Marc Bernal and Marc Casado from La Masia into potential first-team starters is a thrilling prospect. It reflects the club's commitment to nurturing homegrown talent and provides a cost-effective solution to our midfield needs. This approach resonates deeply with our values and history, promising a bright future and continuity of our renowned playing style.\n\nWhile the financial hurdles are daunting, the club's proactive approach to resolving these issues and strategic player movements give hope. The blend of emerging youth talent and targeted acquisitions like Olmo could be the formula that propels Barcelona back to the pinnacle of European football. Our expectations are high as fans, but so is our belief in the club's direction under the current leadership.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girona_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Girona FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriol_Romeu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oriol Romeu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansi_Flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hansi Flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Masia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphinha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raphinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Christensen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andreas Christensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Polo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Polo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tre2G_4jIM5gub18O7pG4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/epl_index_articles_253/5333f4ade85e36ece60d92d383b5ea90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796256", "eventUri": "eng-9796256", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

In six appearances for Spain, the soon-to-be Barcelona midfielder scored three goals and collected two assists as La Roja were crowned European champions.\n\nHowever, for RB Leipzig fans, there must have been a sense of frustration witnessing their midfield maestro perform at such a consistent standard, but why is this the case?\n\nDespite his clear ability to perform at a world-class level, to do so for six games in a row would have felt like a rarity for those associated with Die Roten Bullen watching on. In fact, as per Transfermarkt, during Olmo's four-and-a-half-year stint in Saxony, the 26-year-old has only played 47% of the minutes valuable to him.\n\nSince arriving in Germany in 2020, the Bundesliga outfit have played 216 matches, of which Olmo has only been available for 148. This means that he could have amassed 19,940 minutes of game time for Leipzig.\n\nNevertheless, Olmo has only registered 9,045 minutes of game time, meaning that he has ultimately missed 53% of the minutes available to him through injury. The Spaniard has averaged three injuries per season, and with many of them being muscle-related, it is hard to imagine that these will not carry on during his time in Barcelona.\n\nThis is a significant reason why many clubs refused to trigger his \u20ac60 million release clause in the summer.\n\nIt has been reported that Leipzig are looking to secure Rayan Cherki's signature from Olympique Lyon as Olmo's successor, and while fans of the French outfit may share the same frustrations regarding consistency, they cannot put the blame down to injuries.\n\nInstead, Leipzig see the talent Cherki possesses and hopes to extract it on a more regular basis. Having only suffered one injury during his four-year career, they do not need to worry about consistent muscle tears as displayed with Olmo.\n\nAs well as this, it is understood that they will sign the Frenchman for a third of the price they will receive from Barcelona for Olmo's services, and Leipzig will also believe that one day they will be able to sell Cherki for around \u20ac60 million too.\n\nSo overall, they receive \u20ac60 million for a player who has played less than half of the available minutes and will sign his replacement for \u20ac20 million, whom they will suggest can play every week. For Leipzig, this is a remarkable piece of business, but for Barcelona, they could see their investment ultimately prove to be ludicrous and significantly unreliable.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayan_Cherki", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rayan Cherki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_Lyonnais", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympique Lyonnais"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zg8LqzUSAAlfepIWAHzfsA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/get_german_football_news_articles_128/8b8c2fde9e0f0f8aeb2e93b6d93c81d3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796256", "eventUri": "eng-9796256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

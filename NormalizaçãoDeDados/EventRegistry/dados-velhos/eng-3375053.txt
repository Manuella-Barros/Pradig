Lots going on, so it's the perfect time for a mailbag.\n\nAs always, my deepest gratitude to all those who filed questions, and my deepest apologies to everyone I didn't get to. We'll be back next week for another installment, and every week after that through the end of the season.\n\nQ: I know it was only one game, but is Kenny Golladay being overhyped? -- @jerrye_taylor\n\nA: Depends who you're talking to. If you're talking to the guy who hit the Kool-Aid a little hard this morning and is expecting Golladay to make the Pro Bowl this year, then absolutely. He's not a finished product. There's a reason he was at Northern Illinois in the first place, and why he fell to the third round. He needs some work. And remember, even Calvin Johnson caught just 48 passes for 756 yards as a rookie.\n\nWith Golden Tate and Marvin Jones back, plus Eric Ebron headed for an expanded role in the passing game -- not to mention, Theo Riddick and Ameer Abdullah healthy in the backfield -- Golladay is not going to be a No. 1 or No. 2 target. He might not even be No. 3. So, again, temper those immediate expectations accordingly.\n\nThat said, I've seen nothing to suggest this kid isn't the real deal. He was good in OTAs, excellent in minicamp and has been the talk of training camp. And the thing I really like is he seems to get better the closer he gets to the end zone. He's different than Tate and Riddick in that way. Those guys make a living off grabbing the easy stuff and making magic happen with the ball in their hands. But that can sometimes be tough to do in the red zone, where the field shortens and the defense collapses.\n\nGolladay is a different breed. At 6-foot-4, he can high-point a football. He can box guys out. He can go get the contested football, which makes him an asset in the red zone. And that's exactly what we've seen. Golladay has been a monster in those final 20 yards. At times, he's been unstoppable. And no matter what happens this season, I think he's going to be a primary target there immediately.\n\nHow quickly the rest of the game comes to him will determine his role from there. Tate is still the No. 1, but there will be plenty of balls to go around behind him with Anquan Boldin out. And I see no reason why Golladay can't shoulder some of that load -- particularly in the red zone.\n\nQ: What's the over/under for Golladay receptions this year? -- @TedRutko\n\nA: Like I said, the usage might not be all that high because of how many targets are at Matthew Stafford's disposal. But I think he could be a primary option in the red zone. So something like 45 catches seems reasonable, with five touchdowns.\n\nA: Golden Tate, Marvin Jones and Kenny Golladay are locks. I think TJ Jones still has work to do, but he's safely in right now too. He's repped with the starters all offseason, and been consistently productive.\n\nThat's four receivers, which is what Detroit carried last year. But given the youth at the position this year, and losing reliable vets like Anquan Boldin and Andre Roberts, I think they carry at least one more. I had Jared Abbrederis claiming that spot on my initial roster projection, but it's a coin flip right now with Jace Billingsley, and Keshawn Martin isn't out of it either.\n\nAfter the weekend in Indy, I might give Billingsley the edge now. He was more productive than Abbrederis in the joint practices, and better in the game too.\n\nOf course, the spot we're talking about -- the last receiver on the team -- is more about special teams than anything else anyway. So if any of those guys breaks out as a return man, that could tip the scales regardless of what happens on offense.\n\nOne last note on the receivers: Undrafted rookies Noel Thomas and Dontez Ford have done a lot of good things too, including grabbing nice catches in the opener. Ford showed great physicality and effort on his touchdown catch. I don't think either makes the 53-man roster, but both are really good bets for the practice squad. And Michael Rector could be in that conversation too because of his speed.\n\nQ: Which one of the current Lions players is most likely to be reincarnated as a house cat? Please show your work. -- @redgs550e\n\nA: I'm going to go with a former player we just saw last week in Indy, and say George Winn, whom I'm pretty sure was already a house cat in a former life anyway. The running back used to curl up and sleep right on the floor of the locker room. And he'd sleep through anything. There was a time when Ameer Abdullah was holding court with a large group of reporters, with Winn sleeping at our feet.\n\nHe couldn't be bought with treats, though, which was a bummer. But at least he didn't poop on the floor.\n\nQ: Haven't seen or heard much at all about DJ Hayden. Will he make the team? -- @RealMikeL21\n\nA: I think he definitely makes the team, and not just because Detroit already guaranteed $2.25 million of his salary. He's been pretty good in practice, actually. He's still repping behind Quandre Diggs in the nickel, but Hayden has made things interesting. And even if he loses the job there, Hayden has the versatility to kick outside and backstop Darius Slay and Nevin Lawson.\n\nGuys like that are valuable in the secondary. Cornerback is so difficult to play, yet backups are pressed into action almost every year. I'll never forget 2014, when the Lions lost one nickel, then another, then another, and Danny Gorrer was signed off the street to start against Aaron Rodgers a few days later.\n\nThe same kind of thing happened last year with Asa Jackson. Remember him? Detroit signed him because of injuries at cornerback, then had to start him against Odell Beckham in New York. (It went about as well as you'd imagine.)\n\nDepth in the secondary is a valuable commodity, and the Lions really seem to be developing it. They return all three starting corners, including a pure shut-down guy in Darius Slay. Nevin Lawson looks good heading into a contract year, and even Diggs has really picked up his play after a bad 2016. Throw in Hayden and Johnson Bademosi, who was fine in a couple spot starts last year, and there's a lot to like about what Detroit has going on at the position.\n\nIf the Lions can get after the quarterback, their pass defense has a chance to be good. Of course, that's a really big if these days, and even good corners will look silly without a pass rush.\n\nQ: Will the Lions look at a veteran DE like Williams Odrick or Freeney? -- @bt8ball\n\nA: It's possible, although on Aug. 16, I'm skeptical of how much help is out there. If a guy were good enough to help a team, he'd already have a team. There are exceptions, of course. Rashean Mathis is a great example. He was signed around this time in 2013, and he went on to have a couple good years in Detroit. But that's the exception that proves the rule more than anything else.\n\nThe Lions have less than $8 million in cap space and still want to sign Matthew Stafford to the largest deal in history. So it might make more sense for them to scoop up players who are discarded on cut day -- this year, that's Sept. 2 -- than to spend big on a big name.\n\nQ: Defensive backfield was impressive against Colts. Was that a result of playing a really bad Indy team or have all the investments paid off? -- @raycarson222\n\nA: Starters played only a series or two, and Darius Slay didn't play at all. And the guys who did play never saw a single pass from Andrew Luck. So what you saw against Indy had no impression on me one way or the other about the investments in the secondary.\n\nQ: Will Ziggy be able to play by the opener with his mysterious injury? -- @VauntedJT\n\nA: I expect Ezekiel Ansah to play in the opener. I think sitting him out right now is mostly precautionary. But the fact the Lions even need to take these precautions over an injury that is months old is, in itself, disconcerting. Ansah has been slowed by one thing or another for a long time now. He was able to play through it previously, but the ankle held him to two sacks last season. So it's fair to wonder why he's still slowed by old injuries, and whether they'll return once he is cleared to suit up.\n\nHe'll be out there Week 1, I think. But for how long he's out there, and how effective he is, remains very much to be seen.\n\nQ: How many games could the Lions win with Jake Rudock as their quarterback? -- @5df46606207b42d\n\nA: Four? Maybe five? Maybe? And that's no idictment of Rudock. He played well against Indy, and practiced well before that. He works through his reads and progressions much better than I'd expect from a player who hasn't been in a game in nearly a calendar year. His decision making is good, and he's got some speed to him as well.\n\nBut this Lions team isn't exactly a deep one. There are serious questions about their defense, especially up front, which means they might have to score a lot to win this season. But their running game has struggled for years too, which means they are going to rely a lot on Matthew Stafford for that scoring to happen.\n\nStafford is among the best quarterbacks in the game, so it might work out as long as he's healthy. But if he's not healthy, and the Lions have to rely on a backup -- even an improving backup -- the rest of the roster is not nearly good enough for a playoff push.\n\nQ: What happens if Greg Robinson actually works out when TD gets back? -- @ConDaddy\n\nA: Greg Robinson could be the best left tackle in the league, and Taylor Decker would still replace him when healthy. The Lions invested a first-round pick in Decker, and they like him an awful lot, and they want him to be their franchise left tackle for years to come. Fin.\n\nQ: 40 yard dash, who wins? Your cat or Nate's puppy? -- Blueingreer\n\nA: Kilgore, my cat, has bowled a perfect game. He's shot 11 holes in one. In other words, he's as good at sports as a North Korean dictator. (And, at times, just as dictatorial.)\n\nNobody could beat him in the 40-yard dash.

He can handle the physical play. He can handle the sizzling Matthew Stafford spiral.\n\nRookie Kenny Golladay has handled it all so well, so far, you legitimately wonder if he can handle the hype. Oh, because it's coming. Not just from teammates wowed by his size-speed combination, and not just from coaches impressed by his work ethic.\n\nIt's coming from Lions fans that have spent years inhaling the fumes of wasted hype, and from media who see a 6-foot-4 receiver making two acrobatic touchdown catches in his first preseason game, and they start making wild proclamations. But before anyone plans their Golladay party, know this: He's not interested in pumping the hype machine.\n\nAfter practice Thursday, he was still out there, running routes and catching passes from Stafford. When asked if he felt vindicated as an unheralded third-round pick from a small school, Golladay practically laughed.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" he said. \"I'm just blocking all that out, to be honest. That was one game. We got three more preseason games left, and then a whole regular season. ... I'm very confident in myself. But I didn't feel like I'm the big man or anything like that.\"\n\nIt's easy for Golladay not to feel that way because he's never felt that way, not as an undersized receiver out of Chicago who trekked off to North Dakota to begin his college career. When the coaching staff there was fired, Golladay, who grew four inches after high school, decided to transfer and put together his own highlight tape. He ended up at Northern Illinois, where he caught 160 passes and scored 18 touchdowns the past two seasons.\n\nHumble beginnings are the seeds of perspective, as long as you don't bury them. Watch Golladay work and listen to him talk, you detect more self-confidence than self-centeredness. He doesn't seem to be the type consumed by acclaim, but it's early.\n\nThe Lions have brought him along steadily and are just now starting to throw more at him, finally lining him up with the first team in practice the other day.\n\nTough to excel\n\nThere are historic realities, too -- receivers generally don't break out in their first seasons. There's a reason Randy Moss' rookie year in 1998 remained the standard (1,313 yards, 17 touchdowns) all the way until 2014, when Odell Beckham Jr. piled up 91 catches for 1,305 yards with the Giants. Then last season, Ohio State rookie Michael Thomas had 92 receptions with the Saints.\n\nIt takes time, and no one is suggesting Golladay is in that realm. Ironically, the rarest star was Anquan Boldin with the Cardinals in 2003, when he caught a rookie-record 101 passes for 1,377 yards. Boldin was the Lions' red-zone threat last season and scored eight touchdowns, but they let him go. I'm guessing that was at least partly because general manager Bob Quinn liked what he had in Golladay.\n\nThat's another reason for the premature Golladay holiday -- he might be the latest sign Quinn truly knows what he's doing. Golladay was considered too unrefined to go as high as the third round, according to most projections.\n\nAlmost immediately in training camp, he stood out. His height and gangly legs conjure images of Calvin Johnson, and it helps that Stafford has experience throwing to a guy like that. Golladay said his idol was Moss, and we can see where these crazy comparisons are going. Jim Caldwell can see it too, and while he's not holding the rookie back, he's not hoisting him up, either. Golladay has struggled with route-running at times and has dropped a few passes in practice.\n\n\"If we can keep him from reading the newspapers or listening to the radio, he'll be all right,\" Caldwell said. \"He's one of those guys that's got the right kind of attitude. He works, he's not affected by much, it appears. But he's young. So we'll see.\"\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if Golladay's role expands in the preseason home opener against the Jets Saturday night. He has been a red-zone terror in practice, and his two touchdowns -- 23 and 15 yards from Jake Rudock -- against the Colts last Sunday required excellent hands and body control.\n\nRave reviews\n\nTeammates don't mind raving because they know the impact a big receiver can have on this offense, alongside smaller Marvin Jones Jr. and Golden Tate. The raw physical tools are too imposing to ignore.\n\n\"He's a freak,\" Ameer Abdullah said. \"He's a tall guy, he can jump, he can run, he can do everything. He's the modern-day, freak-of-nature athlete.\"\n\nThat's from inside the team, but the view is similar from the outside. When former receiver Chad Johnson showed up at a Lions practice recently, he left with high praise, delivered in a colorful Tweet: \"I'm not a scout but I know my (blank). Golladay is gonna be special.\"\n\nMaybe he will be. But maybe it won't come as quickly as it first appears. Calvin Johnson only caught 48 passes for 756 yards his rookie season. For a cautionary lesson, there's the sad tale of Titus Young, a second-round pick who caught 48 passes for 607 yards as a Lions rookie in 2011, then battled mental-health and legal issues and was done.\n\nAcclaim can be a flame, and that's true in all sports. Eric Ebron is still waging the expectation battle as the No. 10 overall pick in 2014, although his numbers have steadily risen.\n\nWe are talking about a few practice highlights and one -- ONE -- preseason game for Golladay, so it seems silly to suggest he has to block out the attention.\n\nIt's completely foreign to him because he's never felt it.\n\n\"That's just the type of person I am -- I'm a guy that pretty much fell under the radar all my life,\" Golladay said. \"And then when a guy you haven't heard of is making a few plays, of course you're gonna create some buzz. But I've been doing it my whole life, so I know in my mindset that's nothing.\"\n\nThe Golladay Experience certainly isn't nothing, but until the season actually begins, it's not yet something. That said, by early appearances, it's on its way\n\nBob.wojnowski@detroitnews.com\n\nTwitter.com/bobwojnowski\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T03:15:00Z",

Not after a preseason debut in which he had two touchdown catches with high degrees of difficulty and showed he could be a red zone option. In the team's first practice after the preseason opener against the Colts, Golladay ended up in a new position.\n\nWhen the Lions ran three-receiver sets, he was with the starters, replacing TJ Jones.\n\n\"He's one of those guys that we're just trying to make certain that we give him a bit of experience in a little bit of everything to kind of see where he fits,\" Lions coach Jim Caldwell said. \"We have an idea but you really don't know until you get him a chance to really delve in to one spot or the other. So, we're trying to cross-train him a little bit.\n\n\"But he has the speed. He has the length and those kinds of things you look for, for good matchups on the outside.\"\n\nGolladay worked primarily on the outside during those three-receiver sets and that pushed Golden Tate into the slot -- a place where he's proven he can be a dangerous receiver throughout his career because of his ability to make defenders miss and run after the catch.\n\nIt's not clear if this was a trial period for Golladay or if he has overtaken Jones, who still received some first-team work in certain situations along with Tate and Marvin Jones. TJ Jones and Jared Abbrederis often received second-team work with Jace Billingsley getting a look, too.\n\nConsidering the competition for the fourth-and-fifth receiver spots, that'll still be a battle to watch -- as will where the Lions use Golladay on a more regular basis. Even as he pushes to end up with more reps, expectations for him should be managed because he's more than likely the fifth option in the offense behind Tate, Marvin Jones, Eric Ebron and a combination of Ameer Abdullah and Theo Riddick. But if he keeps playing like he did in practice and the opener, he'll force his way into more opportunities.\n\nStill no Eric Ebron: After the tight end made a cameo in practices in Indianapolis, he once again did not practice Wednesday and Caldwell said he has \"a couple issues that he's dealing with.\" It's not clear, other than the hamstring, what those issues are but he's had knee and ankle injuries in the past. It leads to the question of whether Ebron, now in his fourth season and still yet to play a full 16-game campaign, will always have some sort of injury. Other than the brief appearance in Indianapolis, he hasn't practiced since being injured the first day of training camp.\n\n\"I hope not,\" Caldwell said. \"He's had a few here and there but hopefully he'll get to a point where he gets a pretty healthy stretch going. But sometimes you find guys that are highly-explosive guys, they may have an issue once in a while.\n\n\"But hopefully he can battle through it.\"\n\nCornelius the starter: Cornelius Washington has sat out a lot of training camp due to injuries -- one of the many along the defensive line. But on Wednesday, he returned to practice and was back with the starters opposite Anthony Zettel. Washington was going to be pushed for a starting spot by Kerry Hyder, but Hyder's torn Achilles essentially ended that competition before it started. \"I don't like how this is going down,\" Washington said. \"I was expecting to have to battle with Kerry for the spot, but we still got some young guys coming up.\" He cited Alex Barrett as a player who has caught his eye. But Washington seems to be in a position to be a starter this season opposite Ezekiel Ansah.\n\nA depth corner lack of issue: Between how Teez Tabor looked against the Colts and D.J. Hayden's improved play, the Lions might have strong depth at corner behind Darius Slay and Nevin Lawson. Even the designated special teamer has been showing up more. Johnson Bademosi had a clear interception Wednesday and another one that was overturned (but likely shouldn't have been) in the end zone. He's been consistently around the ball in practice and should be able to handle being the team's No. 3 or No. 4 outside corner this season along with his special teams duties.\n\nMarvin Jones looks good: He continues to be impressive throughout camp, making the play of the day Wednesday with a nice jumping grab over Darius Slay in one-on-one drills. Jones' biggest thing is consistency and turning big plays into touchdowns -- something he's been working on -- and while he didn't get much opportunity against the Colts, he's been consistent in practice over the past two weeks.\n\nThis and that\n\nThe Lions are running into tight end depth issues with Eric Ebron, Tim Wright and Cole Wick out Wednesday. It led to Robert Tonyan receiving some first-team reps. ... A guy who might make a surprise move up the depth chart? Alex Carter.

Lots going on, so it's the perfect time for a mailbag.\n\nAs always, my deepest gratitude to all those who filed questions, and my deepest apologies to everyone I didn't get to. We'll be back next week for another installment, and every week after that through the end of the season.\n\nQ: I know it was only one game, but is Kenny Golladay being overhyped? -- @jerrye_taylor\n\nA: Depends who you're talking to. If you're talking to the guy who hit the Kool-Aid a little hard this morning and is expecting Golladay to make the Pro Bowl this year, then absolutely. He's not a finished product. There's a reason he was at Northern Illinois in the first place, and why he fell to the third round. He needs some work. And remember, even Calvin Johnson caught just 48 passes for 756 yards as a rookie.\n\nWith Golden Tate and Marvin Jones back, plus Eric Ebron headed for an expanded role in the passing game -- not to mention, Theo Riddick and Ameer Abdullah healthy in the backfield -- Golladay is not going to be a No. 1 or No. 2 target. He might not even be No. 3. So, again, temper those immediate expectations accordingly.\n\nThat said, I've seen nothing to suggest this kid isn't the real deal. He was good in OTAs, excellent in minicamp and has been the talk of training camp. And the thing I really like is he seems to get better the closer he gets to the end zone. He's different than Tate and Riddick in that way. Those guys make a living off grabbing the easy stuff and making magic happen with the ball in their hands. But that can sometimes be tough to do in the red zone, where the field shortens and the defense collapses.\n\nGolladay is a different breed. At 6-foot-4, he can high-point a football. He can box guys out. He can go get the contested football, which makes him an asset in the red zone. And that's exactly what we've seen. Golladay has been a monster in those final 20 yards. At times, he's been unstoppable. And no matter what happens this season, I think he's going to be a primary target there immediately.\n\nHow quickly the rest of the game comes to him will determine his role from there. Tate is still the No. 1, but there will be plenty of balls to go around behind him with Anquan Boldin out. And I see no reason why Golladay can't shoulder some of that load -- particularly in the red zone.\n\nQ: What's the over/under for Golladay receptions this year? -- @TedRutko\n\nA: Like I said, the usage might not be all that high because of how many targets are at Matthew Stafford's disposal. But I think he could be a primary option in the red zone. So something like 45 catches seems reasonable, with five touchdowns.\n\nRead Original Post at\n\nhttp://www.mlive.com/lions/index.ssf/2017/08/ask_kyle_detroit_lions_24.html", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T16:32:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375053", "time": "16:32:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375053", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Allen Park"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "207040", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "210424", "label": {"eng": "Allen Park"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Park,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Allen Park"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "210760", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 2}, {"id": "310129", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "score": 2}, {"id": "312092", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "score": 4}, {"id": "324397", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "score": 3}, {"id": "339022", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Calvin Johnson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Johnson", "score": 3}, {"id": "345076", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Forward pass"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_pass", "score": 3}, {"id": "406826", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Anquan Boldin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anquan_Boldin", "score": 1}, {"id": "406827", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Golden Tate"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Tate", "score": 3}, {"id": "411036", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ameer Abdullah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameer_Abdullah", "score": 3}, {"id": "486573", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Theo Riddick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Riddick", "score": 3}, {"id": "500888", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Eric Ebron"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ebron", "score": 3}], "image": "http://l101.sportsmedia101.com/wp-content/uploads/og-a9600c25a0565c18438037f3192f3df8.jpg", "timeCrawl": "16:32:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Ask Kyle: Setting expectations for Lions WR Kenny Golladay", "originalArticle": null}

Like last year, we'll answer your questions in every Sunday's paper once the regular season begins. Follow me on Twitter (@davebirkett) or email submissions to dbirkett@freepress.com.\n\nQ. How much more dangerous does the #Lions offense become if (Golden) Tate can slide into slot with Kenny G's emergence as capable X receiver?? - @petetroit\n\nA. Kenny Golladay has been quite the story this preseason, and his two-touchdown game in the exhibition opener against the Indianapolis Colts has only fueled the hype. Golladay spent a day working with the first-team offense this week for the first time in training camp, and there's no doubt his emergence adds an extra dimension to the Lions offense.\n\nI've been pretty consistent, though, in pumping the brakes on Golladay's stat projections for the year. Golden Tate and Marvin Jones are the Lions' top two receivers, and barring injury, I don't see that changing. For now, Tate remains an outside receiver, with TJ Jones playing in the slot with the first-team offense. When Golladay took No. 1 reps this week, Tate moved inside and Golladay worked out of the X and Z outside spots.\n\nThe Lions used Tate quite a bit out of the slot in his first two seasons with the team - 90 of his 189 catches in 2014-15 came out of the slot, according to ESPN - and as this year goes on, I expect he'll see more time inside. Golladay has more potential than TJ Jones, and his big body should be a weapon in the red zone. Tate is typical slot receiver in a lot of ways, but he's proven he can a factor anywhere he plays.\n\nTo answer your question, I don't see a Marvin Jones-Tate-Golladay pairing as the Lions' primary offensive set, at least not to start the year and maybe not at all this year with the possibility of going two tight ends more. Golladay's emergence does give the Lions more variety and a true red-zone weapon, which they lacked at times last year. Both of those are good things.\n\nQ. All the hype from the fantasy peeps are Abdullah-training it. But what about Riddick? Assuming Abdullah's healthy, what's TR's role in 2017? - @ChrisRackley\n\nA. Fantasy football drafts are fast approaching, including in my own league, so questions like these pop up all the time. Here's both the football and fantasy bottom line: Theo Riddick still will play a significant role on offense for the Lions this fall.\n\nRunning backs coach David Walker has made it clear Ameer Abdullah is the Lions' No. 1 running back. Abdullah will get the bulk of the Lions' carries as long as he stays healthy, and I think he'll have a pretty good season. Maybe 200 carries, 850 yards and a few touchdowns.\n\nRiddick hasn't done much this preseason as he's been in a red no-contact jersey for every practice. That should change soon. If what the Lions did with Abdullah and his red jersey last year is any indication, Riddick will play next week against the Patriots and then be ready for the regular season.\n\n[Wait, what? One NFL analyst says the Lions are better than the Packers]\n\nI think Riddick could easily end up with another 60 or 70 catches, again assuming he plays all 16 games. He's not going to offer much as a between-the-tackles runner, but he is one of the three best pass-catching backs in the NFL.\n\nAbdullah is the better back to own for fantasy purposes - he'll get his share of catches, too. But I don't know that I'd spend too high a pick on either player given their injury histories and the fact that the Lions will split their backfield workload probably three ways, with Zach Zenner involved with some goal-line touches.\n\nQ. Do you think Barrett and Valoaga both make the initial 53? - @jucocon\n\nA. I don't do a 53-man roster projection until right before first cuts for a couple reasons. One, we don't know enough about the new players and where things stand, and two, it's easy to forget we're talking about people's livelihoods.\n\nI do, however, think that both of the Lions' undrafted rookie pass rushers, Alex Barrett and Jeremiah Valoaga, have a chance to make the Week 1 roster. Ziggy Ansah will be back, Anthony Zettel and Cornelius Washington are locks for spots, and Kerry Hyder's injury and Armonty Bryant's suspension have opened up what probably is the final two spots at end.\n\n[Where do the Lions rank? Our 2017 Freep NFL preseason power rankings]\n\nBarrett and Valoaga have consistently played with the second-team defense this summer, and both have flashed play-making ability. I think Barrett is slightly ahead of Valoaga for now, and rookie seventh-round pick Patrick O'Connor also is in the mix.\n\nGiven the questionable health of Ziggy Ansah and Cornelius Washington, who missed time this preseason with an ankle injury, it makes sense to keep both undrafted free agents, at least until Bryant is eligible to return in Week 5.\n\nQ. How is the camp reps and conditioning that Ziggy is missing going to affect him once the season starts? Can he be a force early on? - @MarshRondel\n\nA. Ansah is a proven vet, so the missed time shouldn't be too much of an issue, but he'll certainly need time to get in game shape once he's off the physically unable to perform list. We have not seen Ansah running on the side during practice, like most other injured players do, but Ansah came out to the field midway through practice Thursday and the hoodie he had on under his jersey was drenched, so it was clear he was working out. I wouldn't expect him to be at 70% playtime in Week 1, but if his leg is healthy he still can be a very effective pass rusher.\n\n[NFL record projections: Detroit Lions destined for 5-11]\n\nQ. At what point does the Stafford extension not being completed yet become concerning, and do you feel it will be done before the season? - @EricSalonen\n\nA. What's a mailbag without a Matthew Stafford-contract question to end it? Last time I checked in, there hadn't been much movement between the two sides, but three weeks is a long time for negotiations to get done. I still am of the belief that Stafford will get a new deal before the season, but once games start all bets are off. At that point, the player is assuming more of the risk, the demands rise and playing on the franchise tag next year becomes a more realistic possibility. If the season starts and Stafford tables negotiations, then it's quite reasonable to worry.\n\nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @davebirkett.

They sit out practices here and there -- sometimes at the request of coaches -- to save their bodies for a long, grueling season where everybody is hurting by the end.\n\nIt isn't common, though, to see events such as those that happened Thursday. On the last fully-open practice of training camp for the Detroit Lions, 14 players sat out -- including five of the team's eight tight ends. It's a massive number -- 15 percent of the team's roster -- that sat on the sideline.\n\nThe tally hit almost every position group: one running back (Matt Asiata), two wide receivers (Noel Thomas, Dontez Ford), five tight ends (Eric Ebron, Cole Wick, Tim Wright, Khari Lee and Michael Roberts), three offensive linemen (T.J. Lang, Cornelius Lucas, Laken Tomlinson), two defensive linemen (Bruce Gaston, Haloti Ngata) and one linebacker (Thurston Armbrister).\n\nSome of those -- Ngata and Lang, for instance -- likely are cases of Caldwell measuring the reps of veterans, and they've sat out workouts before. Ebron has been out -- save for part of one practice in Indianapolis -- since getting injured the first day of training camp.\n\nBut it's still something Detroit has to monitor. This is on top of four players still on PUP or NFI lists (Ezekiel Ansah, Taylor Decker, Sam Martin and Corey Robinson) and four players on injured reserve (Kerry Hyder, Mike James, Brandon Chubb and Des Lawrence). Another, linebacker Brandon Copeland, was waived and is expected to revert to injured reserve if he clears waivers Thursday.\n\nDespite all of that, the Lions are not going to use players less just because of a bunch of injuries.\n\n\"You can't play this game that way. You can't coach it that way. You can't play it that way,\" Caldwell said. \"If that's all you think about is injuries, these are not pheasants under glass. They got to get out and they got to play and play the game.\n\n\"You don't back down from that. If you get nervous and you're scared, you might want to go get another job. Do something else.\"\n\nThat said, don't be surprised if the starters play limited time Saturday against the Jets -- as usual for most teams during the second preseason game. Matthew Stafford and the Lions starters should see their most action next Friday against New England.\n\nOther notes:\n\n1. Back to the second team for Golladay: After one day where Kenny Golladay worked primarily with Detroit's first-team offense, he reverted to mostly second-team duties Thursday with T.J. Jones regaining his spot with the starters. It's likely to be a competition there -- one that could be based on field position and game strategy -- who is used when between Jones and Golladay early on. The difference is Golladay is a roster lock while Jones still has some work to do to earn the No. 4 receiver role -- although that seems to be more likely as the weeks go on. Don't be surprised, though, if Golladay ends up running with the first-team offense more often as the season goes along.\n\n2. Last-minute work: The tenor of practice was somewhat familiar Thursday for anyone who saw the Lions win last-minute game after last-minute game last season. Detroit spent part of its team period working on needing to score a touchdown driving down the field with :46 seconds left on the clock. Matthew Stafford and the first-team offense scored -- in large part due to a big pass from Stafford to Marvin Jones in tight coverage to set up a score. It didn't go quite as well for Jake Rudock, who worked down the field with completions to Robert Tonyan before his pass into the end zone on the final play was incomplete to Keshawn Martin with good defense from D.J. Hayden. These types of drills are what Lions players continuously referenced last season when explaining why they were good late in games.\n\n3. A'Shawn Robinson could be in line for a good season: There was evidence of this during the preseason opener against Indianapolis, when he had two passes defended. On Thursday, Robinson had another strong practice, blowing by Greg Robinson in an offensive line/defensive line one-on-one drill and generally being in Detroit's offensive backfield a bunch. Considering the Lions' major questions at defensive end and with a pass-rush in general, a lot will be needed of Robinson to become a playmaker in the middle. There's a chance he ends up becoming that.\n\n4. Some general thoughts after open practices are done: The Lions have a decent roster. Cornerback, safety and receiver are pretty deep and tough cut decisions are likely to be made there. Defensive end is a major question as the Lions -- unless they make a move for someone -- could end up relying on some unknowns to become contributors. Offensive line is still a mystery, although the starting group of Greg Robinson, Graham Glasgow, Travis Swanson, T.J. Lang and Rick Wagner appears to be set. Lang's injuries are going to be something to watch, though. Jake Rudock looks well ahead of Brad Kaaya at quarterback -- that's to be expected -- and there's a large jump between Rudock and Matthew Stafford as well. But Rudock had a good camp, and appears to be the type of player who could take over if the Lions needed him to should something happen to Stafford. And that's one of the things you want out of your backup quarterback.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T23:29:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375053", "time": "23:29:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375053", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "210760", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "211294", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "242110", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 2}, {"id": "304975", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "score": 1}, {"id": "306941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "score": 3}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 4}, {"id": "310130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 5}, {"id": "312092", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "score": 3}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 3}, {"id": "335288", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive line"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_line", "score": 2}, {"id": "342457", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "score": 4}, {"id": "379288", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "T.

Sposato commented the following: \u201cI don\u2019t see Milett as a host, I think that artistically it is difficult for her to find her place, not because of a lack of talent, but because Argentine television is very closed and the public is very demanding, it consumes a lot of the people who \u201cThey have been there for years.\u201d YOU CAN SEE: Rodrigo Gonz\u00e1lez compliments Edson D\u00e1vila after interviewing Jefferson Farf\u00e1n: \u201cHe is here to have his show\u201d At that moment, the charismatic \u2018Giselo\u2019 intervened with the mischief that characterizes him and proposed retiring Yanina Latorre for the popular \u2018Milechi\u2019 to take its place in LAM. \u201cDon\u2019t touch Yanina, she is the best panelist on Argentine television,\u201d Sposato said sternly.

Also how she expresses herself Milett Figueroa without knowing his career,\u201d said Edson. Besides, Ethel Pozo, Brunella Horna and Janet Barboza, her driving companions, supported D\u00e1vila\u2019s opinion. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about her (Yanina) because no one knows her here, the famous one is Milett Figueroa and Marcelo Tinelli\u201cThat\u2019s why we talk in the programs, but I don\u2019t think what he said.\u201d Is Milett unemployed in Argentina?

But concerns about Musk spending too much time on other ventures that were raised in 2018 and since then have not been sufficiently addressed, ISS said.\n\n\"The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board's other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,\" ISS wrote.\n\nAlso, future concerns remain unaddressed, including a lack of clarity on Musk's future compensation and the potential for his pay to significantly dilute shareholder value, ISS wrote.\n\nMusk plays big roles in his other ventures including SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. Last year he bought social media platform X and formed an artificial intelligence unit called xAI.\n\nLast week the other prominent proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis, also recommended against reinstating Musk's 2018 compensation package. The firm said the package would dilute shareholders' value by about 8.7%. The rationale for the package \"does not in our view adequately consider dilution and its long-lasting effects on disinterested shareholders,\" Glass Lewis wrote.\n\nBut in a proxy filing, Tesla said that Glass Lewis failed to consider that the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over $735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved.\n\n\"Tesla is one of the most successful enterprises of our time,\" the filing said. \"We have revolutionized the automotive market and become the first vertically integrated sustainable energy company.\"\n\nTesla is struggling with falling global sales, slowing electric vehicle demand, an aging model lineup and a stock price that has tumbled about 30% this year.\n\nTesla asked shareholders to restore Musk's pay package after it was rejected by a Delaware judge this year. At the time, it also asked to shift the company's legal corporate home to Texas.\n\nGlass Lewis recommended against moving the legal corporate home to Texas, but ISS said it favored the move.\n\nCalifornia's public employee retirement system, which holds a stake in Tesla, said it has not made a final decision on how it will vote on Musk's pay. But CEO Marcie Frost told CNBC that as of Wednesday, the system would not vote in favor. CalPERS, which opposed the package in 2018, said it will discuss the matter with Tesla \"in the coming days.\"\n\nIn January, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick ruled that Musk is not entitled to the landmark stock compensation that was to be granted over 10 years.\n\nRuling on a lawsuit from a shareholder, she voided the pay package, saying that Musk essentially controlled the board, making the process of enacting the compensation unfair to stakeholders. \"Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla's behalf,\" she wrote in her ruling.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders released in a regulatory filing last month, Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm said that Musk has delivered on the growth it was looking for at the automaker, with Tesla meeting all of the stock value and operational targets in the 2018 package. Shares at the time were up 571% since the pay package began.\n\n\"Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,\" Denholm wrote. \"That strikes us\u2009 -- \u2009and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard\u2009 -- \u2009as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it.\"\n\nTesla posted record deliveries of more than 1.8 million electric vehicles worldwide in 2023, but the value of its shares has eroded quickly this year as EV sales soften.\n\nThe company said it delivered 386,810 vehicles from January through March, nearly 9% fewer than it sold in the same period last year. Future growth is in doubt and it may be a challenge to get shareholders to back a fat pay package in an environment where competition has increased worldwide.\n\nStarting last year, Tesla has cut prices as much as $20,000 on some models. The price cuts caused used electric vehicle values to drop and clipped Tesla's profit margins.\n\nIn April, Tesla said that it was letting about 10% of its workers go, about 14,000 people.", "source":

The firm argued that the package was outsized and failed to achieve board objectives. It also noted that Tesla met the pay package's performance objectives and recognized the company's substantial growth in size and profitability. However, concerns about Musk spending too much time on other ventures raised in 2018 and since then have not been sufficiently addressed. A second shareholder advisory firm has come out against reinstating a pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk that was voided earlier this year by a Delaware judge. ISS late Thursday joined Glass Lewis in recommending against the package, recently valued by the company at USD 44.9 billion but in January had a value of about USD 56 billion.\n\nShareholders of the electric vehicle and solar panel company are voting on the package, with the results to be tabulated at Tesla's June 13 annual meeting.\n\nISS said in its recommendations on Tesla's proxy voting items that Musk's stock-based package was outsized when it was approved by shareholders in 2018, and it failed to accomplish board objectives voiced at that time.\n\nThe firm said that Tesla met the pay package's performance objectives, and it recognized the company's substantial growth in size and profitability. But concerns about Musk spending too much time on other ventures that were raised in 2018 and since then have not been sufficiently addressed, ISS said.\n\n\"The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board's other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,\" ISS wrote.\n\nAlso, future concerns remain unaddressed, including a lack of clarity on Musk's future compensation and the potential for his pay to significantly dilute shareholder value, ISS wrote.\n\nMusk plays big roles in his other ventures including SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. Last year he bought social media platform X and formed an artificial intelligence unit called xAI.\n\nLast week the other prominent proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis, also recommended against reinstating Musk's 2018 compensation package. The firm said the package would dilute shareholders' value by about 8.7 per cent. The rationale for the package \"does not in our view adequately consider dilution and its long-lasting effects on disinterested shareholders,\" Glass Lewis wrote.\n\nBut in a proxy filing, Tesla said that Glass Lewis failed to consider that the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over USD 735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved.\n\n\"Tesla is one of the most successful enterprises of our time,\" the filing said. \"We have revolutionized the automotive market and become the first vertically integrated sustainable energy company.\"\n\nTesla is struggling with falling global sales, slowing electric vehicle demand, an aging model lineup and a stock price that has tumbled about 30 per cent this year.\n\nTesla asked shareholders to restore Musk's pay package after it was rejected by a Delaware judge this year. At the time, it also asked to shift the company's legal corporate home to Texas.\n\nGlass Lewis recommended against moving the legal corporate home to Texas, but ISS said it favored the move.\n\nCalifornia's public employee retirement system, which holds a stake in Tesla, said it has not made a final decision on how it will vote on Musk's pay. But CEO Marcie Frost told CNBC that as of Wednesday, the system would not vote in favor. CalPERS, which opposed the package in 2018, said it will discuss the matter with Tesla \"in the coming days.\"\n\nIn January, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St Jude McCormick ruled that Musk is not entitled to the landmark stock compensation that was to be granted over 10 years.\n\nRuling on a lawsuit from a shareholder, she voided the pay package, saying that Musk essentially controlled the board, making the process of enacting the compensation unfair to stakeholders. \"Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla's behalf,\" she wrote in her ruling.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders released in a regulatory filing last month, Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm said that Musk has delivered on the growth it was looking for at the automaker, with Tesla meeting all of the stock value and operational targets in the 2018 package. Shares at the time were up 571 per cent since the pay package began.\n\n\"Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,\" Denholm wrote. \"That strikes us -- and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard -- as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it.\"\n\nTesla posted record deliveries of more than 1.8 million electric vehicles worldwide in 2023, but the value of its shares has eroded quickly this year as EV sales soften.\n\nThe company said it delivered 3,86,810 vehicles from January through March, nearly 9 per cent fewer than it sold in the same period last year. Future growth is in doubt and it may be a challenge to get shareholders to back a fat pay package in an environment where competition has increased worldwide.\n\nStarting last year, Tesla has cut prices as much as USD 20,000 on some models. The price cuts caused used electric vehicle values to drop and clipped Tesla's profit margins.\n\nIn April, Tesla said that it was letting go about 10 per cent -- about 14,000 people -- of its

But in January, a Delaware judge voided the plan, and Tesla subsequently sought to move its state of incorporation to Texas.\n\nUnusually, Tesla put the 2018 pay plan up for a reratification vote at its upcoming annual meeting on 13 June.\n\nWhile the recommendations from the big proxy advisory firms play a role in focusing attention on certain issues at corporate annual meetings, their exact influence on votes is up for debate and criticism.\n\nA recent University of Utah study found their recommendations can have a significant impact on votes but also found the firms themselves may only be channeling the views of investors, their customers.\n\nTesla responded to Glass Lewis's recommendations in a securities filing earlier this week, saying Musk was creating wealth for Tesla stockholders and had \"skin in the game\".\n\nIn recommending votes against Musk's pay, ISS wrote: \"Although the structure of the grant's performance hurdles arguably contributed to, as well as reflect, the company's significant financial growth during the performance period, the total award value remains excessive, even given the company's success.\n\n\"In addition, the grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board's other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,\" the ISS report said.\n\nOther concerns include \"a lack of clarity on the board's plan\" for Musk's future pay, ISS wrote.\n\nISS recommended a vote against Murdoch, who is also an audit committee member, \"given concerns about the risk oversight function of the board\".\n\nTesla is making a public effort to rally support for the pay package, and the company's board has justified the compensation by saying it is necessary to make sure Musk prioritizes Tesla over his other commitments.\n\nTesla shares were slightly lower in premarket trading on

The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla's Gigafactory facility in Austin.\n\nTesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk's payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk's stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.\n\n\"Over the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,\" Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.\n\nTesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon's pay package, some shareholders have voiced their vocal opposition to it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.\n\nISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.\n\nThey've also been the direct target of Musk's ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they \"effectively control the stock market\" on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called \"passive\" or institutional shareholders.\n\nInstitutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.\n\nISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it \"remains excessive,\" noting that \"the board has effectively only offered shareholders an 'all or nothing' option in this vote.\"\n\nThe proxy advisor alluded to Musk's myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.\n\n\"The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board's other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,\"

The annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for June 13, and voting is underway.\n\nDon't miss: Tesla's shareholder meeting has even higher stakes this year. Here's why.\n\nGlass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services are the two largest independent services meant to advise investors on crucial shareholder votes, and their recommendations are influential with large institutional shareholders.\n\nTesla has mounted a marketing push behind its proposals, courting retail investors, who are often Tesla fans. The vote on the pay package is advisory, but a defeat would be an embarrassment for Musk and the EV maker. It would also send a fresh wave of negative sentiment toward the stock, which has struggled this year amid cooled demand for EVs.\n\nIn a twist, ISS came out against the reelection of board member James Murdoch and in favor of Kimbal Musk's reelection. ISS also recommended that Tesla shareholders support the EV maker's reincorporation in Texas, where the company has been headquartered since late 2021, when it moved from California.\n\nThe reincorporation in Texas \"warrants caution,\" but it \"is not readily apparent that the rights of shareholders would be materially harmed as a result of the reincorporation,\" ISS said.\n\nRegarding Musk's pay, ISS said that some investors may agree with the board's argument that it would unfair for Musk not to receive the award, previously approved by shareholders, after some of the milestones the award was tied to were achieved.\n\n\"However, the concerns raised, both back in 2018 and in the interim, have not been sufficiently mitigated, particularly given that the board has effectively only offered shareholders an 'all or nothing' option in this vote,\" the adviser said.\n\nMusk has soured on Delaware, whose Chancery Court is the gold standard for corporate law, after the court's Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick voided his compensation package and called the process of arriving at the $56 billion sum \"deeply flawed.\"\n\nEarlier this month, a group of shareholders, including New York City's investment chief, urged Tesla shareholders to vote against the pay package and against the reelection of Kimbal Musk and Murdoch.\n\nAnd earlier Thursday, the top executive of the U.S.'s largest public pension fund said it would be voting against the pay plan as well.\n\nMarcie Frost, the chief executive of the California Public Employee Retirement System, or CalPERS, said that amount was not commensurate with Tesla's performance.\n\nTesla shares have dropped 28% so far this year, contrasting with gains of about 11% for the S&P 500 index SPX.\n\n-Claudia Assis\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The firm is now calling for Tesla shareholders to ditch the $56 billion pay package that Musk once won but now is set to be voted on for ratification.\n\nISS has routinely recommended things for Tesla shareholders that do not necessarily align with the company's most loyal supporters. In 2021, the firm suggested the EV maker ditch Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch from the company's board.\n\nElon Musk replied to our coverage of the suggestions by calling the firm \"ISIS,\" in reference to the radical Salafi-jihadist terrorist group:\n\nIt is now 2024, and the implications of this Tesla Shareholder meeting are bigger than ever before. Musk was due a $56 billion payday due to tranches reached as Tesla's frontman but had it denied by a Delaware Chancery Judge.\n\nIt is the biggest issue on this year's agenda, and it could end up being the end of his reign at the electric automaker, the end of Tesla's incorporation in Delaware, and perhaps a farewell to the company as many know it.\n\nISS believes Musk's pay package is \"excessive, even given the company's success.\"\n\nThe firm wrote in its report:\n\n\"In addition, the grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board's other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders.\"\n\nIt also noted a \"lack of clarity\" regarding Musk's future pay.\n\nOther firms, like Glass Lewis, have also suggested shareholders vote against Musk's pay plan. Meanwhile, there are plenty of others who believe Musk is owed this sum of money, and the sizing of it is irrelevant: he was already awarded this paycheck before it was taken away.\n\n\"Egan-Jones believes the continuation of this compensation plan is critical for maintaining Musk's leadership and motivation, which are essential for Tesla's sustained growth and innovation. The firm acknowledges the high compensation level but emphasizes the exceptional performance and unique contributions of Musk to Tesla's success,\" Egan-Jones said in its suggestion.\n\nDo you agree with this move?

The company is currently valued at nearly $570bn (\u00a3445bn).\n\nISS said in a report that, although the compensation package arguably reflected \"the company's significant financial growth,\" it also \"remains excessive, even given the company's success\".\n\nThe advisers said the amount \"failed to achieve the board's other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavours, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders\".\n\nISS said there were also other concerns including \"a lack of clarity on the board's plan\" for Musk's future pay.\n\nRead more from business:\n\nHouse prices 'rebound'\n\nBritons put record amounts into ISAs\n\nBoeing blocked from increasing production\n\nTesla has defended the plans and said Musk had generated wealth for stockholders because he has \"skin in the game\".\n\nIn comments earlier this week, responding to similar criticism, the company said Musk had helped it achieve \"performance targets that were regarded by many as extremely difficult or impossible\".\n\nIt added: \"Stockholders should care enormously about value creation.... and not about whether Elon's perceived 'focus' was strong enough.\"\n\nIt comes after the company's quarterly revenue dropped in April for the first time in almost four years.\n\nCompetition from China and slowing demand for electric vehicles have been blamed for the recent downturn in the firm's fortunes, along with controversies surrounding Musk.\n\nIt came as Tesla announced on Friday a recall of more than 125,000 of its vehicles in the US to fix problems with seat belt warning systems.\n\nUS officials said the alerts - which are supposed to inform and remind drivers if a seat belt is not fastened - were not going off as expected and did not comply with safety regulations, raising the risk of people getting injured during a crash.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the recall included certain 2012-2024 Model S, 2015-2024 Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_Shareholder_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Institutional Shareholder Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proxy voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_recall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Product recall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seat belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Value_Based_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Value Based Management", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skynews-elon-musk-tesla_6570413.jpg?20240531130205", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614909", "eventUri": "eng-9614909", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 863, "textEnd": 870}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The firm acknowledges the high compensation level but emphasizes the exceptional performance and unique contributions of Musk to Tesla's success,\" the firm noted.\n\nWhile Tesla stock has fallen from its all-time highs, the company has added about $500 billion to its market cap since Elon Musk's 2018 compensation plan was approved, as noted in a Barron's report. This effectively made Tesla into the world's most valuable carmaker by valuation. Tesla's vehicle deliveries have seen a notable rise as well, from 255,000 in 2018 to about 1.8 million in 2023.\n\nThe targets outlined in Musk's 2018 CEO Performance Award have been fully achieved, though some TSLA investors such as Glass Lewis have recommended that shareholders should vote \"No\" to the ratification of the CEO's compensation plan. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, for his part, however, has noted that Musk's pay package would likely still be ratified at the 2024 Annual Stockholders' Meeting.\n\n\"A yes vote is in the cards so Tesla shareholders can move on from this Delaware disaster. The Musk 2018 Compensation issue has been an overhang on the stock and we believe on June 13 this finally gets resolved,\" Ives noted.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact us with news tips.

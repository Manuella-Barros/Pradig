(AP) -- New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says she regrets making an offhand remark that suggested Black children in the Bronx do not know what the word \"computer\" means.\n\nHochul, a Democrat, made the extemporaneous comment Monday while being interviewed at a large business conference in California to discuss expanding economic opportunities in artificial intelligence for low-income communities.\n\n\"Right now, we have young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word computer is.

Kathy Hochul blabbered into a microphone Monday.\n\n\"They don't know, they don't know these things. And I want the world opened up to all of them,\" she continued.\n\nHer full quote reads:\n\nNow what we have is the money to build a phenomenal super computer that is gonna be accessible to the researchers in New York, college students, will attract more federal grants, and this is how we lay down the mark. No state has done this. In fact, I talk to a lot of other people who say, \"I wish my governor had thought of that first.\" I say, \"No no, this is New York. We like to be first,\" with all due respect to you from other states. It's sort of our attitude. We will be the best, we will be the first, and I want others to follow because right now we have, you know, young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word \"computer\" is. They don't know. They don't know these things.\n\n\"And I want the world opened up to all of them because when you have their diverse voices innovating solutions through technology, then you're really addressing society's broader challenges.\"\n\nAnd yes, it's on video. Better yet, it's on HER OWN YOUTUBE CHANNEL.\n\nThis assumption is incredibly bad and utterly inane, especially considering that these kids just four years ago were condemned to a year-plus of ONLINE SCHOOL FROM A COMPUTER. Or did those black kids in the Bronx just not go to school for a full year?\n\nLocal politicians were quick to roast Hochul, which is no surprise.\n\n\"I'm deeply troubled by the recent statements made by Governor Kathy Hochul,\" wrote New York State Assembly Member John Zaccaro Jr. in a statement. \"The underlying perception conveyed about Black and brown children from the Bronx is not only disheartening but also deeply concerning.\"\n\nAssembly Member Karines Reyes said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by Hochul's remarks and \"the underlying perception that she has of Black & brown children from the BX.\"\n\n\"Our children are bright, brilliant, extremely capable, and more than deserving of any opportunities that are extended to other kids,\" Reyes wrote. \"Do better.\"\n\nAssembly Member Amanda Septimo called Hochul's comments \"harmful, deeply misinformed, and genuinely appalling,\" and accused the governor of \"repeating harmful stereotypes,\" while Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie described Hochul's remarks as \"inartful and hurtful.\"\n\nWell, Heastie did call her comments \"inartful and hurtful,\" but that was in DEFENSE of Hochul. No surprise, as the wagons circled to protect the \"D.\"\n\nNew York state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat who represents the Bronx in the Legislature, came to Hochul's defense as her remarks began to gain traction online.\n\n\"While the governor's words were inartful and hurtful, I don't believe that is where her heart is. I firmly believe she wants to see all of our students excel,\" Heastie said.\n\nHochul, once the blowback began, immediately issued a statement claiming she \"misspoke.\"\n\n\"I misspoke and I regret it,\" Hochul later told the Post in a statement. \"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI. That's why I've been focused on increasing economic opportunity since Day One of my Administration.\"\n\nActually, Day One of your administration, Madam Governor, you were busy cleaning the office after Andrew Cuomo left it, and then flexing your own authoritarian muscle when it came to Covid orders. \"Increasing economic opportunity\" was definitely not what you were \"focused\" on at that time. Nice historical revision, but no.\n\nSo even though Kathy Hochul did her best Joe Biden impression...\n\n... she will walk away from this without any major repercussions. That \"D\" after her name is positively magical. Can you imagine if a Republican governor like Ron DeSantis or Sarah Sanders had said something like this? It would lead every single evening news show in the country. MSNBC would be having a complete meltdown on air. But because Hochul is a Democrat, when you Google her name this morning and hit the \"news\" tab, you only see print media articles (Fox News excepted) leading the way from the New York Times, the AP, and the Daily Mail. ABC News does have an article on it now, but what are the odds it makes the news tonight?

Hochul was being interviewed by Washington Post columnist and MSNBC host Jonathan Capehart on stage during a discussion hosted by the Milken Institute in Los Angeles. In discussing the state's \"Empire AI\" initiative that will provide supercomputer access in the Buffalo area, Hochul said \"Right now, we have young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word 'computer' is,\" adding, \"They don't know, they don't know these things. I want the world opened up to all of them.\"\n\nThe comment drew immediate backlash from local politicians. Assemblywoman Karines Reyes, who represents several neighborhoods in the Bronx, issued a statement in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \"Deeply disturbed by @GovKathyHochul's recent remarks and the underlying perception that she has of Black & brown children from the BX. Our children are bright, brilliant, extremely capable, and more than deserving of any opportunities that are extended to other kids. Do better.\" She was joined by fellow Assemblywoman Amanda Septimo who issued a statement calling the governor's remarks \"deeply misinformed, and genuinely appalling.\"\n\nHochul would apologize later that evening. \"I misspoke and I regret it,\" she said. In a statement released later, she elaborated further: \"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are - the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI.\" It's not the first time that Hochul has made a verbal misstep. In February, Hochul hypothesized what would happen if Canada attacked the United States similar to how the Hamas militant organization attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. \"If Canada someday ever attacked Buffalo, I'm sorry, my friends, there would be no Canada the next day,\" she said at the time. Hochul would also quickly apologize for her \"poor choice of words\" the next day.\n\nNY Governor Kathy Hochul Apologizes For Remarks on Black Bronx Kids was originally published on hiphopwired.com", "source": {"uri": "theurbandaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Urban Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@theurbandaily.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karines_Reyes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karines Reyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Septimo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amanda Septimo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/05/17152582903344.jpg?w=640&strip=all&quality=85", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545672", "eventUri": "eng-9545672", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 185, "textEnd": 190}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

(TND) -- New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is facing backlash from fellow Democrats after saying Black children living in the Bronx don't know \"what the word computer is.\"\n\nGov. Hochul attended the Milken Institute Global Conference Monday, an annual gathering of political and business leaders in California. Her controversial remarks came while discussing New York's Empire AI Consortium, an initiative designed to bolster research and development of artificial intelligence in the state.\n\n\"No state has done this,\" Gov. Hochul told journalist Jonathan Capehart. \"And in fact, I talked to a lot of other people who said, 'I wish my governor had thought of that first.'\"\n\nThis is New York,\" she continued. \"We'd like to be first ... we will be the best, we will be the first and I want others to follow because right now we have, you know, young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word computer is.\"\n\nGov. Hochul went on to note that ensuring there are a variety of voices in technology addresses \"society's broader challenges.\"\n\nThe remarks quickly sparked outrage from Democratic lawmakers around New York City, with some calling them \"deeply\" disturbing and misinformed.\n\nOur children are bright, brilliant, extremely capable, and more than deserving of any opportunities that are extended to other kids,\" Assemblymember Karina Reeves, D-Westchester Square, said. \"Do better.\"\n\n\"The Bronx I know and love is full of children who are smart, curious, and eager for opportunities to learn and grow,\" Assemblymember Amanda Septimo, D-South Bronx, added. \"Repeating harmful stereotypes about one of our most underserved communities, while failing to acknowledge the state's consistent institutional neglect, only perpetuates systems of abuse.\"\n\nREAD MORE | NY Republican slams Gov. Hochul for 'misguided priorities' with education budget proposals\n\nHowever, others chose to defend the governor. Sen. Luis Sepulveda, D-West Farms, asserted he has \"always felt that [Gov. Hochul] cares about the Bronx.\"\n\n\"The governor has visited the Bronx many more times than her predecessors.\" Sen. Sepulveda noted.\n\nIn a statement to The National Desk (TND) Tuesday, Gov. Hochul said she \"misspoke\" and \"regret[s]\" her choice of words.\n\n\"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI,\" the governor said. \"That's why I've been focused on increasing economic opportunity since Day One of my Administration, and will continue that fight to ensure every New Yorker has a shot at a good-paying job.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc7amarillo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KVII"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristina_watrobski@abc7amarillo.com", "name": "Kristina Watrobski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milken_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milken Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Septimo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amanda Septimo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National Desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Sep\u00falveda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Sep\u00falveda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://abc7amarillo.com/resources/media/6b146a9f-c48c-4c45-94f1-849b58491c02-large16x9_GettyImages1336121626.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545672", "eventUri": "eng-9545672", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Clearly, Hochul hasn't spent much time in the Bronx -- only, she has. Just last month, she toured a legal cannabis dispensary that opened on April 21. No word on whether or not she picked up a ham and cheese on a roll, an orange drink, and a small bag of chips while she was there, though. This is unfortunate since the \"orange drink\" is something that people actually don't know about, especially people in the Bronx.\n\nHours after her remarks (and a lot of much-deserved backlash), Hochul offered an apology: \"I misspoke and I regret it.\"\n\n\"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are-the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI,\" she continued.

Lo and behold, Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul ascended to New York's vacant governor's seat and immediately confirmed everyone's fears.\n\nHochul was a tyrannical Branch Covidian. She's radically pro-abortion, soft on crime, anti-Second Amendment, and slow to respond to the immigration crises in New York -- and when she does tepidly respond, she blames Republicans instead of trying to solve the problem.\n\nHer latest public debacle has managed to anger both sides of the political aisle, and for good reason. Hochul was recently in California at the Milken Institute Global Conference, where she was interviewed about how artificial intelligence can help with economic growth in low-income areas. She lamented: \"Right now, we have, you know, young black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word 'computer' is. They don't know. They don't know these things.\"\n\nNot only is that untrue, but it's deeply offensive to blacks in the Bronx (or anywhere else, for that matter). This unforced error also riled up fellow New York politicians. Bronx Assemblywoman Amanda Septimo criticized Hochul, saying it was \"harmful, deeply misinformed, and genuinely appalling.\" She added: \"Repeating harmful stereotypes about one of our most underserved communities, while failing to acknowledge the state's consistent institutional neglect, only perpetuates systems of abuse. I would invite Gov. Hochul to visit us in the Bronx to experience first-hand the intelligence, resilience, and joy that radiate from Bronx children and residents each day.\" Bronx Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie also called Hochul's comment \"inartful.\"\n\nConservatives pointed out that this seems to be a pattern with Democrats. Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon noted that \"Democrats are always trying to prove they aren't racist by talking about how dumb and incapable minorities are.\" Libs of TikTok advised: \"Democrats exposing their racism again... Play this video in every predominantly black neighborhood until November.\" Fox Business host Charles Payne, who is black, remarked, \"Insulting but typical.\"\n\nOther examples of Democrat bigotry include thinking black people are somehow uniquely incapable of obtaining a photo ID for use when voting and that academic standards and standardized tests need to be abolished so that black kids can succeed educationally. Furthermore, Democrats have turned cities into hotbeds of poverty and lack of opportunity for black residents through welfare. Their soft-on-crime policies are using the guise of racism to make urban communities more dangerous places by claiming police disproportionately arrest black men. New York City is a prime example of this. Everything Democrats do to \"help\" the black community seems to further drag down and infantilize that community. Ironically, it's the black vote that helps keep these Democrats in power, and so the cycle continues.\n\nDemocrats also protect their own. New York City Mayor Eric Adams was quick to defend Hochul, saying: \"When you make thousands of speeches, when you're in front of the cameras all the time, when you're trying to be authentic and say the things that you're really feeling, one can sit back and do a critical analysis of every sentence you say. I know her heart. I know what she was intending to say, and she was not trying to be disrespectful to the people of the Bronx.\"\n\nPerhaps that is true, but this was a big slip-up and one that should have been corrected right then and there. \"New York Governor Kathy Hochul, saying something that would get a Republican instantly cancelled, but it's (D)ifferent,\" observes Kevin Dalton, former candidate for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.\n\nFor her part, Hochul eventually apologized in a statement, saying: \"I misspoke and I regret it. Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI.\"\n\nShe should have quickly clarified that during the conference and corrected herself. But because she's got a \"D\" after her name, she'll get a pass.", "source": {"uri": "patriotpost.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Patriot Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

New York Governor Kathy Hochul is apologizing after finding herself in the hot seat over her poor comments.\n\nAs we previously covered, in her recent address at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles, she made a remark that has stirred up controversy. She stated that young Black kids are growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word \"computer\" means... Her intention was to generate publicity for the state's $400 million \"Empire AI\" initiative, aimed at funding artificial intelligence in New York and expanding access to cutting-edge technology training in low-income areas, including the Bronx.\n\nHowever, her comments immediately drew backlash from officials and lawmakers in the Bronx. They criticized her for perpetuating stereotypes and making generalizations about Black children's knowledge and access to technology. The remarks were seen as insensitive and offensive, as they ignored the reality that many Black children are indeed familiar with computers and technology. Recognizing this problem, Governor Hochul issued an apology through a statement to the New York Post. She said:\n\n\"I misspoke and I regret it,\" Hochul told the outlet. \"Of course, Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI. That's why I've been focused on increasing economic opportunity since Day One of my Administration.\"\n\nRELATED:WATCH: NY Gov.

They don't know, they don't know these things.\" Hochul said this amid a broader rhetorical assault that included a push to expand \"economic opportunities in artificial intelligence for low-income communities,\" as the Associated Press has put it. Here's the full clip:\n\nAs you might expect, Hochul was ridiculed pretty hard for this take. After some local outcry on Monday, Hochul predictably put her tail between her legs and issued a statement, claiming: \"I misspoke and I regret it. Of course, Black children in the Bronx know what computers are.\"\n\nTo say that Hochul's previous interpretation of urban digital literacy strains credibility is to put it mildly. Let's be honest: There are computers everywhere. If, for some reason, you and everybody you know have never owned a computer (doubtful), or have never seen one on TV (again, seemingly impossible), or, somehow, have never stepped inside a public school where there are at least a few computers, you'd have to assume, you'd have at least heard about computers from a teacher or another kid, there are still droves of people walking around the city holding small computers in their hands, all the time. Maybe Hochul was thinking of babies? Or dogs? I'm pretty sure there are still some babies and dogs that don't know about computers.\n\nLook, I actually think it'd be great if fewer children knew what computers were. If popular social scientists like Jonathan Haidt are to be believed, most kids these days are growing up with an iPhone glued to their face and it's causing many of them to become mentally ill. Indeed, today's youth seem to be having their childhoods ruined by perpetual digital connection. Thus, if Hochul really cares about New York's children, she should try to expand access to non-digital services that would provide greater socialization. Hochul should try to ensure that, just like those fictional Bronx kids she was talking about, every NYC child can afford to go through their early years with little understanding of our digital landscape.

(AP) -- New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says she regrets making an offhand remark that suggested Black children in the Bronx do not know what the word \"computer\" means.\n\nHochul, a Democrat, made the extemporaneous comment Monday while being interviewed at a large business conference in California to discuss expanding economic opportunities in artificial intelligence for low-income communities.\n\n\"Right now, we have young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word computer is. They don't know, they don't know these things,\" Hochul said while on stage at the Milken Institute Global Conference.\n\nThe remark was not addressed during the interview and the governor went on to explain that her goal is to provide avenues for communities of color to access emerging artificial intelligence technologies as a means to address social inequality.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Orchard Park woman charged with fraud over $8M deal for face masks she never delivered\n\nStill, the comment drew immediate criticism from some political leaders in New York, including state Assemblywoman Amanda Septimo, a Bronx Democrat, who said the remark was \"harmful, deeply misinformed, and genuinely appalling.\"\n\nIn a statement later Monday, Hochul said \"I misspoke and I regret it.\"\n\n\"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI,\" Hochul said. \"That's why I've been focused on increasing economic opportunity since Day One of my Administration, and will continue that fight to ensure every New Yorker has a shot at a good-paying job.\"\n\nNew York state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat who represents the Bronx in the Legislature, came to Hochul's defense as her remarks began to gain traction online.\n\n\"While the governor's words were inartful and hurtful, I don't believe that is where her heart is. I firmly believe she wants to see all of our students excel,\" Heastie said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kathy Hochul Says They Don't Know What a Computer Is", "body": "Queens rapper 50 Cent took to social media to slam the governor of his home state for saying young Black youth in an adjacent borough did not know what a computer is.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul made the erroneous and what some believe is racially charged statement on Monday, May 6, at the Milken Institute Global Conference.\n\n\"Right now, we have young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word computer is. They don't know, they don't know these things,\" Hochul said from the state at the business conference in California.\n\nAssemblywoman Amanda Septimo, a Bronx Democrat, also slammed the New York politician, stating that her statements were \"harmful, deeply misinformed, and genuinely appalling.\"\n\nOthers on social media were offended by Gov. Hochul's statements, even as she later backpedaled, explaining that she regrets her making the statement.\n\n\"What the f -- k is this? This just shows how out of touch they are,\" read one comment on the Hip Hop Wolf's Instagram profile. \"They be 2 years old and know how to work a iPad better than the people in the Apple Store.\"\n\nA third comment said, \"I guarantee she ain't had a conversation with a young black kid from the Bronx to know that.\" Another Instagram user added, \"Correction... Half of the kids in the Bronx don't know who you are miss thing. She tried it.\"\n\nLater that same day, Gov. Hochul apologized for her remarks in a statement shared with NBC News.\n\n\"While discussing my commitment to expanding economic opportunity for communities of color, I misspoke and I regret it,\" she said. \"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI.\"\n\n50 clearly was not moved and after catching wind of her statement, he took to Instagram on May 8 to say, \"I don't know, any black kids that don't know what a computer is in the Bronx. WTF They know how to work a iPad better than me.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" rapper has gone after the governor this year, although in the previous instances he took a far more controversial position.\n\nIn February, he called on Hochul to check New York Mayor Eric Adams for proposing pilot programs like his $53 million plan to assist the migrant population.\n\n\"I want to talk to @govkathyhochul about the laws preventing [Mayor Adams] from doing things to make the situation better in New York...and where the proposed 2.4 billion she's planning on spending on migrants is coming from...NOT MY TAXES!\" Fif wrote at the time.\n\n50 Cent moved to Houston, Texas, in 2021 but still seems to have a vested interest in his hometown. He has lived in and owns properties, according to The Richest.com, in South Jamaica, Queens, where he grew up; Saddle River, New Jersey; Atlanta; Hollywood Hills, California; Long Island; Farmington, Connecticut; and a vacation homes in both Cancun, Mexico, and South Africa. He recently unveiled his G-Unit production studio in Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\nIt is not clear how actively involved he is in any of the politics in those locations.

Kathy Hochul is pictured at the Northeast Bronx YMCA on June 6, 2022, in New York City. | Source: Michael M. Santiago / Getty\n\nHere's the problem: There are a lot of white people, probably most, who simply don't know anything about Black people. Maybe this is because white people still, by a fairly wide margin, have the lowest percentage of interracial social groups. Maybe it's because, in America, they're more than 60% of the population, which means many of them don't come across non-white people on a day-to-day basis, and because Black people represent roughly 13%, the only time many of them see us is on the TV screen, where they're more likely to see stereotypes and dense representation of Black life instead of seeing us fairly represented in all of our cultural and social diversity. Whatever the reason is, white folks simply don't know much about us so when they speak on us, especially when they're trying to relate to us, they just end up saying the dumbest, most ignorant and racist thing imaginable.\n\nTake New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, for example. Now, I don't know what the racial makeup of Hochul's social networks looks like, but she made a comment recently that leads me to believe her circle is of the raisins in potato salad persuasion.\n\n\"Right now we have, you know, young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word 'computer' is. They don't know. They don't know these things,\" she said while speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles on Monday, according to Mediaite.\n\nNow, to be fair, up until that point, Hochul was discussing something that sounded like it might be progressive and impactful in terms of bringing opportunities to underserved communities in the form of high-tech jobs, particularly in A.I., which was the topic for the event.\n\n\"Now what we have is the money to build a phenomenal supercomputer that is gonna be accessible to the researchers in New York, college students, will attract more federal grants, and this is how we lay down the mark,\" she said. \"No state has done this. In fact, I talk to a lot of other people who say, 'I wish my governor had thought of that first.' I say, 'No no, this is New York. We like to be first,' with all due respect to you from other states. It's sort of our attitude. We will be the best, we will be the first, and I want others to follow...\"\n\nAaaaand that's where she should have stopped.\n\nHochul was doing fine. She showed excitement and optimism for the initiatives her state is apparently taking in bringing people to the tech world. There wasn't even anything wrong with her wanting to mention specifically how it could present advantages to young Black kids. (I mean, that kind of talk will get the anti-DEI conservatives all riled up, but, you know, f*** them.) But Hochul, like many white people, especially white people in politics, was unable to identify with Black people, let alone Black children, so while speaking with a Black interviewer, she chose to say a thing that anyone with even a single Black friend whose name isn't Tim Scott, Candace Owens or Jason Whitlock should have known was egregiously offensive -- even for an off-hand remark.\n\nImagine believing that poor Black kids from the Bronx are so primitive and isolated from the modern, technological world that, in 2024, they're looking at a computer for the first time and saying, \"Well, I'll be. What kind of strange contraption is this, massa'? In fact, what is a 'contraption?' I don't even know how I learned that -- what's that thing letters come together to make? -- word.\"\n\nSuffice it to say, the backlash was swift, particularly, from Black officials in the Bronx like Assembly Member Karines Reyes, who responded by telling Hochul via X, \"Our children are bright, brilliant, extremely capable, and more than deserving of any opportunities that are extended to other kids.\"\n\nOf course, after the backlash started pouring in, Hochul issued an apology and a whitesplanation of what she was actually trying to say.\n\n\"I misspoke and I regret it,\" she said in a statement. \"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI. That's why I've been focused on increasing economic opportunity since Day One of my Administration.\"\n\nShe isn't wrong about the lack of access, of course, but the words \"I misspoke\" represent the biggest cop-out for the use of offensive language second only to \"It was taken out of context.\" Hochul didn't misspeak -- she said exactly what she intended to say. My guess is she spoke through a Caucasian lens that simply hasn't had any intimate exposure to the Black populace in her state, and that caused her to say something extremely stupid -- and extremely white.\n\nHopefully, she has learned something from this experience.\n\nRIP Johnny Hollman Sr.: Family Of Church Deacon Tased To Death By Atlanta Cop Welcomes $3.8M Settlement\n\nLight Sentence?

Hochul's Casual Racism To Slide?", "body": "The corporate media, quick to characterize conservative reaction to the news of the day as \"pouncing\" and seizing\", are currently doing just that all over Gov. Kristi Noem's latest book and the revelations therein. Which is their right. But in the interest of walking and chewing gum at the same time, there should be an equal focus on statements just made by New York Governor Kathy Hochul.\n\nWatch as Gov. Hochul demonstrates the left's casual bigotry of low expectations, saying to WashPost editor and MSNBC/PBS host Jonathan Capehart's face that there are \"black kids growing up in The Bronx who don't even know what the word 'computer' is\":\n\nKATHY HOCHUL: In fact, I talk to a lot of other people who say, \"I wish my governor had thought of that first\", and I say, \"No no, this is New York. We like to be first, with all due respect to people from other states. It's sort of- it's sort of our attitude. You know, \"we will be the best- we will be the first\". And I want others to follow because right now we have, you know, young black kids growing up in The Bronx who don't even know what the word \"computer\" is. They- they don't know- they don't know these things, and I want the world to open up to all of them because when you have their diverse voices innovating solutions through technology, then you're really addressing society's broader challenges.\n\nCan you get away with casual racism so long as you wrap your casual racism around some woke word salad? Hochul certainly seems to think so. And Capehart offers no challenge or pushback against what Hochul is saying here. From a journalistic perspective, of course.\n\nOne immediately wonders what the fallout would be if it were a conservative saying such things. Where would media reaction fall on a scale of 1-Chernobyl? The more prominent the governor, the closer to Chernobyl. Just imagine the coverage if, say, Ron DeSantis had said something similar.\n\nThere is literally no excuse for the media not covering Hochul's statements. The lazy corporate media tend to turn New York stories into national stories. By extension, THIS is a national story. In this day and age, Hochul's utterances warrant ceaseless A-block coverage up and down the dial.

She later expressed regret for the remark, made during a discussion on expanding economic opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSpeaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in California, Governor Hochul, a Democrat, said, \"Right now, we have young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word computer is. They don't know, they don't know these things.\" While her intention seemed to be advocating for improved access to technology and economic opportunities, her choice of words drew immediate backlash, AP News reported.\n\nState Assemblywoman Amanda Septimo said the remark was \"harmful, deeply misinformed, and genuinely appalling.\" However, New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie came to Hochul's defense, attributing her words to a lack of articulation rather than malice.\n\n\"While the governor's words were inartful and hurtful, I don't believe that is where her heart is. I firmly believe she wants to see all of our students excel,\" Heastie said.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Governor Hochul issued a statement expressing regret for her words, acknowledging that Black children in the Bronx are indeed aware of computers but often lack access to them. She emphasized her commitment to addressing economic disparities and creating pathways to high-paying jobs, including those in emerging industries like AI.\n\nIn a statement later, Hochul said \"I misspoke and I regret it.\"\n\n\"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI,\" Hochul said. \"That's why I've been focused on increasing economic opportunity since Day One of my Administration, and will continue that fight to ensure every New Yorker has a shot at a good-paying job.\"\n\nThe timing of Hochul's controversial remark coincides with the establishment of a reparations and racial justice commission in New York. Signed into law by Hochul, this commission is tasked with studying the legacy of slavery and its ongoing impact on communities of African descent. The commission aims to provide recommendations on addressing historical injustices and systemic discrimination.\n\n\"This commission acknowledges the horrific injustice of slavery and will be tasked with examining the legacy of slavery, subsequent discrimination against people of African descent, and the impact these forces continue to have in the present day,\" a news release from Hochul's office said, CNN reported.\n\nThe legislation will form a commission of nine members \"who are especially qualified to serve by virtue of their expertise, education, training, or lived experience,\" that will examine slavery \"and its lingering negative effects on people currently living in the State of New York,\" the statement continued.\n\nMayor Eric Adams of New York City emphasized the importance of studying reparations, highlighting the intergenerational wealth disparities rooted in slavery and historical injustices.\n\nNew York's efforts to establish a reparations commission align with similar initiatives in other states, such as California, where a task force has proposed recommendations for compensating Black residents harmed by slavery and historical atrocities.", "source":

They don't know, they don't know these things.\" -- New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, during a Monday interview at the Milken Institute Global Conference\n\nIf recent polling is any indication, it seems pretty clear to everyone that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul could be doing a better job of running her state. If I may offer a little advice, maybe she could start by understanding New York City a little better -- and by being just a biiiiiiit less racist.\n\nOur setting for Hochul's latest offense is the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, where the 27 annual Milken Institute Global Conference kicked off on Monday. This year, the dayslong \"Davos of North America\" has brought together a wide range of prominent voices (government bureaucrats, business executives, internet trolls, etc.) to address the theme of \"Shaping a Shared Future\" -- meaning, per the institute's website, an opportunity to \"unite our catalytic community to tackle\" pressing global issues like regional warfare, climate change, and artificial intelligence, and to \"make strides toward a world where our combined efforts yield transformative results.\"\n\nPretty classic pablum from the think tank started by Michael Milken, who's perhaps best known for turbocharging innovations in securities fraud that earned him a government-imposed lifetime ban from the industry and a brief prison sentence back in the 1990s. (President Donald Trump, whose treasonous administration members continue to be welcome conference participants, would later pardon him in 2020.) Milken's longtime post-prison gig -- chairing this eponymous institute and collecting a bunch of powerful rich people to talk about, like, Living in a Society -- has generated plenty of controversy over the decades, between the institute's sketchy \"research,\" the right-wing moguls who received plenty of Milken money and then advocated for his pardon, and the conference affiliates who've simped on behalf of modern-day villains like the Carlyle Group and Elon Musk.\n\nIt seems apt, then, that Kathy Hochul's gaffe occurred against this backdrop, as she flew from her home state to California in order to highlight New York's \"Empire A.I. Consortium,\" a $400 million state-led initiative that Hochul hopes will \"make New York the next Silicon Valley,\" per WXXI News. In a Day One Milken conference chat with newscaster Jonathan Capehart, Hochul \"explained her desire to make technology more widely accessible, especially in low-income communities,\" according to the New York Times. It was while she breathlessly touted spending \"the money to build a phenomenal supercomputer,\" something that \"no other state has done,\" that she harped on New York's opportunity to be \"the best\" and then stumbled into her unfortunate remark, as recorded by Gothamist's Jon Campbell:\n\nMaybe, you might be thinking, her comments were taken out of context. But even in the full paragraph, I'm not sure that what she said looks all that much better. It seems pretty clear Hochul is unaware that the Bronx is home to literal hundreds of high-achieving public and specialty schools, including a nationally ranked High School of Science. She doesn't appear to think that \"young Black kids\" from the borough that birthed the globally dominant music genre known as hip-hop would possess any literacy or vocabulary, forget any actual technological prowess with recording studios and music-production apps. Maybe most insulting of all, the most she seems to actually know about these kids is that they supposedly have \"diverse voices.\"\n\nThere was no pushback to Hochul's comment in the moment, whether from Capehart himself (who is Black) or from conference attendees. After several Bronx lawmakers expressed their understandable anger, the governor did say she regretted it, writing in a media statement Monday evening that she \"misspoke\": \"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like A.I.\"\n\nSure, but it doesn't seem like Hochul actually cares much about what the Bronx's Black children get to access, considering that she'd proposed education funding cuts in the very same state budget that funded her prized supercomputer. (She walked those back following widespread backlash, naturally.) Hochul certainly doesn't seem to care about educational resources at the municipal level, either, considering how many cuts Mayor Eric Adams is still trying to make to New York City's education budget. The \"law and order\"-focused city leader would also prefer to splurge more money on A.I. instead of schools, including an official-services chatbot that misrepresents local NYC regulations and straight-up tells its users to break the law. I'm sure Bronx schoolchildren love hearing that their government wants to increase their \"access\" to the technology of the future by gutting their classrooms and boosting malfunctioning computers.\n\nIncidentally, Hochul did find a defender in Adams, who claimed to \"know the Governor's heart\" and said he wasn't going to act like \"the word police\" when it came to her statements. Hey, we finally found a cop Eric Adams doesn't love!", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nitish_pahwa@slate.com", "name": "Nitish

I have not heard these comments, so I want to make sure I go back, read the comments, get a sense of what was happening here,\" Jean-Pierre responded.\n\nShe added, \"I just want to go back and see exactly... I know you're reading an excerpt or a line from what she said, but I just want to be super, super mindful here.\"\n\nThe reporter then asked, \"Does the White House believe it is right to insinuate that Black kids don't know what the word computer is?\"\n\n\"I mean look, obviously we don't think that is the right way to speak about young people in any way, in any form, but I do want to be mindful and to be fair here and to go back and hear exactly what she said,\" Jean-Pierre responded.\n\nDuring an event at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles on Monday, Hochul said there are \"young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don't even know what the word 'computer' is. They don't know. They don't know these things.\"\n\n\"And I want the world opened up to all of them because when you have their diverse voices innovating solutions through technology, then you're really addressing society's broader challenges,\" she added.\n\n\"Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are -- the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI. That's why I've been focused on increasing economic opportunity since Day One of my Administration,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "ijr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IJR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bradley_cortright@ijr.com", "name": "Bradley Cortright", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milken_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milken Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Computer_Science", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Computer Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Non-Profit", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Non-Profit", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://ijr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-08-8.26.04-AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545672", "eventUri": "eng-9545672", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Hochul, with insulting and ignorant comments about black kids.\n\nWhile speaking onstage in a California forum about her desire to have more of a diverse workforce in artificial intelligence, she attempted to highlight the disadvantage some have -- but instead made an unfounded presumption about them.\n\n\"Right now we have, you know, young black kids growing up in The Bronx who don't even know what the word 'computer' is,\" Hochul said.\n\n\"They don't know, they don't know these things,\" she continued.\n\n\"And I want the world opened up to all of them.\"\n\nOf course, her statement about black children's knowledge of the existence of computers was met with swift backlash, even from lawmakers within her party.\n\n\"Deeply disturbed by @GovKathyHochul's recent remarks and the underlying perception that she has of Black & brown children from the BX,\" lamented Bronx Assembly member Karines Reyes on X.\n\n\"Our children are bright, brilliant, extremely capable, and more than deserving of any opportunities that are extended to other kids. Do better.\"\n\nWhile many want to translate this moment as being a gaffe, I believe it served as a window into the mindset of many mainstream elitist Democrats.\n\nHochul inadvertently revealed how she's a country-club Democrat who perceives anyone who isn't a member of the upper class as being beyond ignorant and incapable.\n\nTo smother the mild guilt they feel for being fortunate, such people pretend to understand the plight of the unfortunate with leftist virtue-signaling.\n\nIronically, her twisted belief that black children are ignorant of a word reveals her ignorance about the world.\n\nIt would be bad enough to presume black children in The Bronx don't have computers, but she verbalizes an even more putrid belief that the word \"computer\" isn't anywhere to be found in their vocabulary.\n\nIt makes me wonder: How deep does the pit of Democratic condescension go?\n\nDoes she believe black people in The Bronx use rotary phones because they never discovered the wonders of an iPhone?\n\nWould she be shocked to know that black people don't walk barefoot in New York and that shoes are readily accessible to them?\n\nThere has yet to be a day that I regret leaving the Democratic Party and choosing political independence, because I know that this mentality of seeing people who look like me as expectedly pitiful -- and being shocked when we are successful -- is rampant.\n\nHochul and her country-club Democrats pass themselves off as being the saviors of black people when we didn't ask them to be.\n\nThey're self-serving narcissists who use our likeness for social clout and voter-base bragging rights -- when, at the end of the day, we are nothing more than the help that caters to them at their exclusive clubs.\n\nThe party I used to support still argues that black people are less capable of getting a government-issued ID to vote, when I've yet to meet a black adult in my entire life who didn't have one.\n\nAnd now it makes sense: They think we can't Google where the DMV is because we don't have a computer to complete this task. I mean, what even is a \"Google\"?\n\nI have a problem with being led by elitists who've disconnected themselves from the reality of the average American because they often invent falsehoods about our existence -- as it's more comforting for them to use their imaginations than to leave their gated communities.\n\nI spent part of my childhood poor and homeless, yet I've defied the Democratic odds of not only knowing how to use a computer but previously having an entire career in the information-technology field.\n\nBeing poor is not the same as being incapable or unintelligent and lacking resources, and it doesn't determine your outcome unless you want it to.\n\nGov.

However, if a Republican says this, the media will be in a frenzy against said member.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised our lives in myriad ways, from personalising our social media feeds to giving us driving directions and monitoring our health.\n\nSydney, Aug 6 (The Conversation) Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised our lives in myriad ways, from personalising our social media feeds to giving us driving directions and monitoring our health.\n\nIn recent years, hopes have grown that AI may also help humanity tackle global environmental problems such as climate change.\n\nAlso Read | Violence Continues in Bangladesh: 135 People Killed in Clash Across Country; Mob Storms Jail, Sets Free Over 500 Inmates.\n\nAI involves using computers to make them think like humans. It can solve complex problems and process huge amounts of data.\n\nBut the technology brings with it a host of environmental costs. Here, we weigh up the pros and cons.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Unrest: Student Leaders Call for Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus to Head Interim Government After Sheikh Hasina Leaves Country.\n\nAI systems can control and optimise energy use. For example, AI-powered \"smart grids\" monitor and manage electricity generation to meet the demand of consumers, which can both lower energy costs and allow for more efficient energy use.\n\nAI can also help streamline the energy used by big commercial and industrial systems. Tech giant Google, for instance, used AI to cut the amount of energy required to cool its data centres by 40%.\n\nUrban Infrastructure\n\nWaste management systems driven by AI may help increase recycling rates. In the United Kingdom, for example, recycling company Recycleye uses AI to identify materials for sorting, lowering contamination rates and increasing recycling volumes - and so, reducing pressure on landfill.\n\nAnd AI-powered \"smart cities\" technologies help make public transport systems work more smoothly, which can reduce congestion and minimise vehicle emissions.\n\nArtificial intelligence can also be deployed to improve air quality in cities. IBM, for example, uses the technology to analyse weather and air pollution data from sensors and satellites. This can help authorities pinpoint pollution sources, make air quality forecasts and issue health alerts.\n\nSustainable agriculture\n\nAI-powered smart machines, robots and sensors are already used in agriculture.\n\nThey can provide real-time monitoring of weather, soil conditions and crop needs, leading to better water use and ensuring crops receive only what they need.\n\nThe technology can also identify pests, reducing the need to spray chemical pesticides on crops.\n\nAs climate change worsens, there are hopes AI can help farmers avoid reduced crop yields and become more resilient.\n\nEnvironmental monitoring\n\nAI systems can forecast floods, bushfires and other natural hazards quickly and accurately. This can minimise the effects of natural hazards on both the environment and communities.\n\nAI can be used to track environmental change. For example, it can reportedly measure changes in icebergs 10,000 times faster than a human can.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental group The Nature Conservancy uses AI to minimise the environmental impacts of hydropower across the Amazon.\n\nBut what about the downsides?\n\nThe path to realising the potential of AI is fraught - and the technology comes with several major downsides, as outlined below.\n\nEnergy use\n\nArtificial intelligence guzzles a huge amount of energy. First the computer models must be \"trained\", or fed a large set of data. This feeding can be relatively quick, or take up to several months - during which time big data processors are running 24/7.\n\nAnd when we ask AI to solve a problem, this also requires processing power which consumes energy. Advanced AI models such as ChatGPT reportedly use ten times more energy per search than a conventional Google search, according to one estimate. Only a small fraction of this demand is met by renewable energy sources.\n\nThe International Energy Agency projects electricity consumption from data centres, AI and cryptocurrency sector could double in the four years to 2026, from 460 terawatt-hours in 2022 to more than 1,000 terrawatt-hours in 2026.\n\nBy comparison, total electricity generation in Australia in 2022 was around 273 terawatt-hours.\n\nGreener AI systems are urgently needed - and this is looking increasingly possible. Studies have shown the energy use of AI-based computer models can be slashed through various means, such as reducing a model's complexity without affecting its performance.\n\nWater impacts\n\nThe water requirements of AI are significant. The data centres housing powerful AI servers generate a lot of heat. Water is used in cooling to keep the servers at operating temperature.\n\nAI also consumes water indirectly through its energy consumption. Coal-fired power stations use water for cooling, and water is also lost through evaporation from hydro electricity schemes.\n\nAnd as others have noted, the mining and manufacturing required to produce AI hardware both uses and pollutes water.\n\nBroader environmental damage\n\nThe environmental impact of AI goes beyond its energy use. For example, as Scientific American has reported, ExxonMobil in 2019 partnered with Microsoft to deploy AI in oil extraction, substantially increasing production.\n\nAs the article also noted, the use of AI in targeted online advertising - on platforms such as Instagram and Facebook - creates demand for material goods. This leads to greater consumption of mass-produced items which creates carbon emissions and uses Earth's natural resources.\n\nWhere to now?\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into modern life, its environmental footprint will grow. Humanity must find the right balance to ensure AI helps the Earth, rather than harms it.\n\nTo better achieve this, standard criteria must be developed to accurately measure the effects of AI on the environment.\n\nThere is also a push from some quarters for more environmental regulation of AI, and greater transparency from companies about their AI-related emissions.\n\nBut efforts to make AI more environmentally friendly will struggle for public and industry acceptance if the effectiveness of AI systems is sacrificed. To avoid this, stronger collaboration between researchers and the AI industry is needed.

It can solve complex problems and process huge amounts of data.\n\nBut the technology brings with it a host of environmental costs. Here, we weigh up the pros and cons.\n\nAI systems can control and optimise energy use. For example, AI-powered \"smart grids\" monitor and manage electricity generation to meet the demand of consumers, which can both lower energy costs and allow for more efficient energy use.\n\nAI can also help streamline the energy used by big commercial and industrial systems. Tech giant Google, for instance, used AI to cut the amount of energy required to cool its data centres by 40%.\n\nUrban Infrastructure\n\nWaste management systems driven by AI may help increase recycling rates. In the United Kingdom, for example, recycling company Recycleye uses AI to identify materials for sorting, lowering contamination rates and increasing recycling volumes - and so, reducing pressure on landfill.\n\nAnd AI-powered \"smart cities\" technologies help make public transport systems work more smoothly, which can reduce congestion and minimise vehicle emissions.\n\nArtificial intelligence can also be deployed to improve air quality in cities. IBM, for example, uses the technology to\n\nanalyse weather and air pollution data from sensors and satellites. This can help authorities pinpoint pollution sources, make air quality forecasts and issue health alerts.\n\nSustainable agriculture\n\nAI-powered smart machines, robots and sensors are already used in agriculture.\n\nThey can provide real-time monitoring of weather, soil conditions and crop needs, leading to better water use and ensuring crops receive only what they need.\n\nThe technology can also identify pests, reducing the need to spray chemical pesticides on crops.\n\nAs climate change worsens, there are hopes AI can help farmers avoid reduced crop yields and become more resilient.\n\nEnvironmental monitoring\n\nAI systems can forecast floods, bushfires and other natural hazards quickly and accurately. This can minimise the effects of natural hazards on both the environment and communities.\n\nAI can be used to track environmental change. For example, it can reportedly measure changes in icebergs 10,000 times faster than a human can.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental group The Nature Conservancy uses AI to minimise the environmental impacts of hydropower across the Amazon.\n\nBut what about the downsides?\n\nThe path to realising the potential of AI is fraught - and the technology comes with several major downsides, as outlined below.\n\nEnergy use\n\nArtificial intelligence guzzles a huge amount of energy. First the computer models must be \"trained\", or fed a large set of data. This feeding can be relatively quick, or take up to several months - during which time big data processors are running 24/7.\n\nAnd when we ask AI to solve a problem, this also requires processing power which consumes energy. Advanced AI models such as ChatGPT reportedly use ten times more energy per search than a conventional Google search, according to one estimate. Only a small fraction of this demand is met by renewable energy sources.\n\nThe International Energy Agency projects electricity consumption from data centres, AI and cryptocurrency sector could double in the four years to 2026, from 460 terawatt-hours in 2022 to more than 1,000 terrawatt-hours in 2026.\n\nBy comparison, total electricity generation in Australia in 2022 was around 273 terawatt-hours.\n\nGreener AI systems are urgently needed - and this is looking increasingly possible. Studies have shown the energy use of AI-based computer models can be slashed through various means, such as reducing a model's complexity without affecting its performance.\n\nWater impacts\n\nThe water requirements of AI are significant. The data centres housing powerful AI servers generate a lot of heat. Water is used in cooling to keep the servers at operating temperature.\n\nAI also consumes water indirectly through its energy consumption. Coal-fired power stations use water for cooling, and water is also lost through evaporation from hydro electricity schemes.\n\nAnd as others have noted, the mining and manufacturing required to produce AI hardware both uses and pollutes water.\n\nBroader environmental damage\n\nThe environmental impact of AI goes beyond its energy use. For example, as Scientific American has reported, ExxonMobil in 2019 partnered with Microsoft to deploy AI in oil extraction, substantially increasing production.\n\nAs the article also noted, the use of AI in targeted online advertising - on platforms such as Instagram and Facebook - creates demand for material goods. This leads to greater consumption of mass-produced items which creates carbon emissions and uses Earth's natural resources.\n\nWhere to now?\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into modern life, its environmental footprint will grow. Humanity must find the right balance to ensure AI helps the Earth, rather than harms it.\n\nTo better achieve this, standard criteria must be developed to accurately measure the effects of AI on the environment.\n\nThere is also a push from some quarters for more environmental regulation of AI, and greater transparency from companies about their AI-related emissions.\n\nBut efforts to make AI more environmentally friendly will struggle for public and industry acceptance if the effectiveness of AI systems is sacrificed. To avoid this, stronger collaboration between researchers and the AI industry is needed.\n\nEhsan Noroozinejad does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or

So if it's ambiguous morally for humans and they can't come to an agreement, there are huge implications when we let computers make these decisions for themselves,\" Arghal said.\n\nAt Novi High School this summer, Arghal and fellow teacher Adithya Sairamachandran are leading AI Scholars, an in-person boot camp that exposes high school students to fundamental AI concepts and guides them to build a project with social impact.\n\nThe two-week, pre-college enrichment program costs $1,500 and was created by Inspirit AI, a company started to inspire students at an early age to understand and apply Artificial Intelligence to improve the world, said Maddie Bradshaw, director of product at the Palo Alto, California company.\n\n\"It's this idea that high schoolers can learn how to see themselves in AI and apply it to their interests,\" Bradshaw said. \"AI is a hot topic. We want to provide students with a toolkit so they can see its impact on medicine, criminal justice and economics. So students can see themselves in the fields they may be entering.\"\n\nThe intensive summer school comes at a time when many Michigan school districts lack policies on AI's use in the classroom or for schoolwork, even though it is moving quickly into the lives of young people and as a national debate has emerged over how to best manage the tool in personal lives and workplaces.\n\nAt the Novi summer school, organizers said they are bringing the most recent developments in AI from courses and labs in Silicon Valley to empower high school students globally. The focus on ethics is just as important, Bradshaw said.\n\n\"Just like other types of technology, AI is a tool that exists,\" she said. \"We want students to learn social, cultural, economic implications of this technology with the intentions of them using this tool for good.\"\n\nAbout 17 students are spending two weeks learning about AI's core technologies, including applications, foundational concepts and programming tools. In the second half of the course, students complete a mentor-led AI for Social Good project where they apply the programming skills they've learned.\n\nAmong the projects the students are working on:\n\nTeens and their families are already using AI in everyday life, from Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant technology, to iPhone's face recognition technology. Averi Moncrief, 16, enrolled in the intensive program to further her interest in engineering as a career. She came to the class with some coding experience but not in Python, which she learned in the first week of summer class.\n\n\"AI can be used for a wonderful thing like medical advancement or to make life a whole lot easier. It can be a great thing if used correctly. If not used correctly, it can become a problem,\" Moncrief said.\n\nPart of classroom discussions have included how AI and human \"thinking\" differ, Moncrief said, explaining that AI sees letters of words while humans see the full sentence.\n\n\"AI kind of thinks like humans but not quite like humans,\" she said.\n\nVrishab Makam, 15, said he signed up to learn more about foundational AI concepts and Python notebooks. The 10th grader is part of the robotics team at Novi High School and wants to focus on computer science.\n\n\"It's very beginner-friendly, and I liked that,\" Makam said. \"We are learning about different applications of AI like computer vision, natural language processing. Like AI being able to read and understand text and understand what they actually mean. Not just looking at the characters, but retain the meaning.\"\n\nMichigan educators said school districts still face the challenge of training teachers to use all the new tools available for lesson planning, direct instruction and one-on-one tutoring for students. Teachers are changing their assignments to be more AI proof, and schools are looking to integrate AI into courses to teach students appropriate use.\n\nIn April, Michigan Virtual released a K-12 AI Guidance document that offers an educator approach to AI use, including recommended practices and data stewardship. It focuses on the impacts of data compliance, ethical use requirements and the challenges around disclosure for educators.\n\nMichigan Virtual, a nonprofit that provides online courses for students and professional development for educators, created an AI Lab to support schools as they learn about the technology.\n\nJustin Bruno, an AI learning strategist at Michigan Virtual, said most Michigan school districts are in the early stages of navigating AI, holding awareness sessions to make sure teachers, administrators, parents and students understand what AI is and its potential impact on education before they dive into developing and creating policies.\n\n\"Schools want to build AI literacy among their staff first. They are hesitant to take any steps before they know their teachers are ready,\" Bruno said. \"It's been a grassroots approach and mostly dependent on the teacher and their own capacity.\"\n\nThe next steps for school districts include forming an advisory team and exploring AI tools, Bruno said, as well as exploring equity issues around AI, such as that the technology might create disadvantages for minority or low-income students.\n\n\"School leaders are trying to figure this out among all the competing priorities,\" Bruno said.\n\nAlthough some schools are trying to restrict student use of things like ChatGPT, Sairamachandran said he encourages educators and the public not to view AI as the enemy but as an aid to learning.\n\n\"At the end of the day, as educators, our goal is to ensure that students know how to work with the technology around them,\" he said. \"They are going to be entering a workforce in a couple of years from now where this is going to be commonplace. We are using AI in the real world.\"\n\n\u00a92024 The Detroit News.

For a free copy of the 2024 AI in Education Report, please visit https://discover.carnegielearning.com/ai-in-education.\n\nAdvancements are moving at a rapid pace with artificial intelligence. This has alarm bells ringing in many industries, including education. While AI has been used successfully in schools for decades, the explosive growth of generative AI tools has thrust this technology into the spotlight.\n\nBut what do educators think about AI? We surveyed approximately 800 K12 educators to better understand how districts and schools are navigating this new frontier.\n\nHere are five key findings:\n\n1. There are major gaps between administrators and teachers. Two-thirds of educators are somewhat or extremely optimistic about the future of AI in education. Yet, there is an enthusiasm gap between administrators and teachers. While 39% of administrators are extremely optimistic about the adoption of artificial intelligence tools, only 22% of teachers are.\n\nThere is a usage gap as well. Although more than three-quarters of educators believe that AI can be helpful, only about half use it. Here, too, there is a marked difference between administrators and teachers. While 67% of school and district administrators use AI for work, only 53% of teachers do.\n\n2. Educators are anxious about student usage. A whopping 81% of educators worry about AI's impact on academic integrity. So, it's no surprise that a majority (61%) have banned student use of AI. Overall, teachers are less comfortable with students using AI than administrators are. While 23% of teachers are very uncomfortable with allowing students to use AI, only 8% of administrators are.\n\n'Talking Out of School' podcast: 3 characteristics of a powerful portrait of a graduate\n\n3. Educators' primary concerns are cheating and a lack of training. Among educators who are using AI, 52% find the biggest challenge to be students using AI for cheating. Half of educators say that a lack of AI training and support is another top concern -- and it's easy to see why. While 93% of administrators believe it is important to provide AI training and support to teachers, only 25% have done so.\n\nMost students haven't been instructed on AI use either. More than half (58%) of teachers have not discussed the proper and improper use of AI with their students.\n\n4. The biggest benefits for students are different than for educators. While educators' top benefit from AI is saving time, they believe the biggest benefit it can bring to students is building a deeper understanding of concepts or lessons. Other student benefits include making learning more efficient, fostering creativity, creating more equitable learning environments, building confidence and increasing student achievement.\n\n5. AI policies are lacking. Although interest in AI is increasing, most educators have not yet implemented policies for AI. Eighty percent of administrators have no AI policy at their school or district. Similarly, 74% of teachers do not have a classroom policy.\n\nNext steps in artificial intelligence\n\nOverall, educators seem cautiously optimistic about artificial intelligence and its future in education, but there is more work to be done. These survey results can open the door to conversations and point the way to actions that administrators can take to ensure that AI is working for the benefit of everyone.\n\nHere are a few action steps to start:\n\nLooking forward\n\nThe survey findings confirm AI's potential to enhance efficiency, engagement and equity if thoughtfully implemented.

It can solve complex problems and process huge amounts of data.\n\nBut the technology brings with it a host of environmental costs. Here, we weigh up the pros and cons.\n\n4 ways AI can help the natural world\n\nEnergy efficiency\n\nAI systems can control and optimise energy use. For example, AI-powered \"smart grids\" monitor and manage electricity generation to meet the demand of consumers, which can both lower energy costs and allow for more efficient energy use.\n\nAI can also help streamline the energy used by big commercial and industrial systems. Tech giant Google, for instance, used AI to cut the amount of energy required to cool its data centres by 40%.\n\nUrban Infrastructure\n\nWaste management systems driven by AI may help increase recycling rates. In the United Kingdom, for example, recycling company Recycleye uses AI to identify materials for sorting, lowering contamination rates and increasing recycling volumes - and so, reducing pressure on landfill.\n\nAnd AI-powered \"smart cities\" technologies help make public transport systems work more smoothly, which can reduce congestion and minimise vehicle emissions.\n\nArtificial intelligence can also be deployed to improve air quality in cities. IBM, for example, uses the technology toanalyse weather and air pollution data from sensors and satellites. This can help authorities pinpoint pollution sources, make air quality forecasts and issue health alerts.\n\nSustainable agriculture\n\nAI-powered smart machines, robots and sensors are already used in agriculture.\n\nThey can provide real-time monitoring of weather, soil conditions and crop needs, leading to better water use and ensuring crops receive only what they need.\n\nThe technology can also identify pests, reducing the need to spray chemical pesticides on crops.\n\nAs climate change worsens, there are hopes AI can help farmers avoid reduced crop yields and become more resilient.\n\nEnvironmental monitoring\n\nAI systems can forecast floods, bushfires and other natural hazards quickly and accurately. This can minimise the effects of natural hazards on both the environment and communities.\n\nAI can be used to track environmental change. For example, it can reportedly measure changes in icebergs 10,000 times faster than a human can.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental group The Nature Conservancy uses AI to minimise the environmental impacts of hydropower across the Amazon.\n\nBut what about the downsides?\n\nThe path to realising the potential of AI is fraught - and the technology comes with several major downsides, as outlined below.\n\nEnergy use\n\nArtificial intelligence guzzles a huge amount of energy. First the computer models must be \"trained\", or fed a large set of data. This feeding can be relatively quick, or take up to several months - during which time big data processors are running 24/7.\n\nAnd when we ask AI to solve a problem, this also requires processing power which consumes energy. Advanced AI models such as ChatGPT reportedly use ten times more energy per search than a conventional Google search, according to one estimate. Only a small fraction of this demand is met by renewable energy sources.\n\nThe International Energy Agency projects electricity consumption from data centres, AI and cryptocurrency sector could double in the four years to 2026, from 460 terawatt-hours in 2022 to more than 1,000 terrawatt-hours in 2026.\n\nBy comparison, total electricity generation in Australia in 2022 was around 273 terawatt-hours.\n\nGreener AI systems are urgently needed - and this is looking increasingly possible. Studies have shown the energy use of AI-based computer models can be slashed through various means, such as reducing a model's complexity without affecting its performance.\n\nWater impacts\n\nThe water requirements of AI are significant. The data centres housing powerful AI servers generate a lot of heat. Water is used in cooling to keep the servers at operating temperature.\n\nAI also consumes water indirectly through its energy consumption. Coal-fired power stations use water for cooling, and water is also lost through evaporation from hydro electricity schemes.\n\nAnd as others have noted, the mining and manufacturing required to produce AI hardware both uses and pollutes water.\n\nBroader environmental damage\n\nThe environmental impact of AI goes beyond its energy use. For example, as Scientific American has reported, ExxonMobil in 2019 partnered with Microsoft to deploy AI in oil extraction, substantially increasing production.\n\nAs the article also noted, the use of AI in targeted online advertising - on platforms such as Instagram and Facebook - creates demand for material goods. This leads to greater consumption of mass-produced items which creates carbon emissions and uses Earth's natural resources.\n\nWhere to now?\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into modern life, its environmental footprint will grow. Humanity must find the right balance to ensure AI helps the Earth, rather than harms it.\n\nTo better achieve this, standard criteria must be developed to accurately measure the effects of AI on the environment.\n\nThere is also a push from some quarters for more environmental regulation of AI, and greater transparency from companies about their AI-related emissions.\n\nBut efforts to make AI more environmentally friendly will struggle for public and industry acceptance if the effectiveness of AI systems is sacrificed. To avoid this, stronger collaboration between researchers and the AI industry is needed.\n\nEhsan Noroozinejad does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article.\n\nSeyedali Mirjalili does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\nRisk Warning: Cryptocurrency is a unregulated virtual notoriously volatile instrument with a high level of risk.

The path to realising the potential of AI is fraught - and the technology comes with several major downsides, as outlined below.\n\nEnergy use Artificial intelligence guzzles a huge amount of energy.\n\nFirst the computer models must be 'trained', or fed a large set of data.\n\nThis feeding can be relatively quick, or take up to several months, during which time big data processors are running 24/7.\n\nAnd when we ask AI to solve a problem, this also requires processing power which consumes energy.\n\nAdvanced AI models such as ChatGPT reportedly use ten times more energy per search than a conventional Google search, according to one estimate.\n\nOnly a small fraction of this demand is met by renewable energy sources.\n\nThe International Energy Agency projects electricity consumption from data centres, AI and cryptocurrency sector could double in the four years to 2026, from 460 terawatt-hours in 2022 to more than 1,000 terrawatt-hours in 2026.", "source": {"uri":

However, the research reveals that businesses with revenues of over $500 million ranked only third in terms of optimism due to a clear polarisation in strategy, data readiness, and skills.\n\nIndeed, the polarisation in AI readiness has led to 25% of this group believing AI benefits will materialise within 12 months, while the laggards don't expect to see benefits for at least three years. Large enterprises showed the widest gaps in time to benefits of any of the company size groups surveyed.\n\nIn contrast, the survey revealed mid-sized ($50-$200 million) firms being less optimistic about AI purely because they have fewer resources and skills to deploy to the technology today, and therefore are planning over a longer period of time to drive benefits from a maturing technology.\n\nChristian Pedersen, Chief Product Officer, IFS, commented: \"At the surface level, the lack of optimism across some respondents may suggest we are at the edge of a trough of disillusionment, particularly following the all-encompassing hype that AI enjoyed for much of the last 18 months. What we are actually witnessing is enterprises differentiating themselves with AI. Organisations that have established a strong data foundation, invested in skills, and embedded sustainability into their strategy are optimistic because they can see the benefits coming into view quickly. It is vital that leaders see AI as a strategy, not a tool.\"\n\nFactors paving the way on the smooth path to AI\n\nDelving into what fuels optimism around AI, the research suggests that companies' architectural readiness directly correlates with their overall optimism about the technology. Respondents who report being more architecturally ready are more likely to be optimistic about AI. This indicates that companies with a strong cloud-based foundation are further along in their AI journeys and are most likely to believe that the tangible benefits of AI will become a reality sooner.\n\nPedersen continued: \"Our research provides direct evidence that the market is dividing into those who have embraced AI and those who have not.\" Pederson emphasised that the projected rewards of AI, potentially unlocking $4.4 trillion in annual corporate profits, are pressuring businesses to adapt. However, without a clear strategy, AI initiatives risk stalling.\n\nEmergence of Industrial AI for productivity\n\nInnovative products and services (31%) and data accessibility (30%) are the most common areas senior decision-makers expect AI to make large differences, followed closely by cost reductions (29%). Interestingly, at a country level, the USA (32%) and Germany (31%) were the only nations most likely to believe that AI will lead to consistent business growth.\n\nThe survey reveals a positive correlation between skills and AI optimism. The nations most likely to identify as having invested heavily in skills for several years are generally more optimistic about AI overall. France (49%), UAE (53%), Norway (48%), Australia (46%), Sweden (46%) and Japan (45%) are leading the way here.\n\nSustainability planning also correlates directly with overall AI optimism. The less wide-ranging a country's sustainability strategy was with regard to AI, the less likely they were to be optimistic about AI in general. UK (5%), Canadian (6%), Danish (6%) and Finnish (4%) respondents were least likely to have an AI strategy for sustainability in place and all feature in the bottom half of the optimism league table.\n\n\"The lofty expectations for AI bely a fundamental misunderstanding of how it is supposed to drive value. The real power lies in Industrial AI, where data flows through every part of your business, combining structured, interlinked datasets to uncover insights, optimise every process and marry the digital with the physical world. That's where the true value lies. If a business doesn't have a strategy to reach that point, then they need a partner who can guide them on that journey,\" concluded Pedersen.\n\nCopyright 2024 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Computer scientists have been struggling with the possibility of programming computers to learn from repetitive experiences, much as a newborn child does. A British mathematician and logician, Alan Turing, in the 1950s, posed the question: \"Can machines think?\" Thanks to the convergence of powerful computers, large amounts of data and novel ways of designing neural networks, we are finally beginning to see the birth of AI after 70 years.\n\nThe announcement of ChatGPT by Open AI, a startup, began a big bang of AI boom on November 30, 2022. ChatGPT is a virtual assistant (a ChatBot) that allows the user to assist them with composing essays and creating content in the form of text, photos, and videos. It can be used to translate languages and write code. The user can perform human-like conversations with the computer and get answers to their questions on a wide range of topics. ChatGPT works through its 'generative pre-trained transformer': a type of machine learning algorithm that uses deep learning and a large database of training text to generate new text in response to a user's prompt.\n\nAI is beginning to make an impact across a wide range of industries. AI has made significant strides in medical imaging, providing tools that can assist or sometimes even surpass human radiologists in detecting diseases. AI is being used to analyse massive datasets of genetics, proteins, and clinical data to pinpoint promising targets for new drugs, significantly accelerating the process of identifying potential treatments for diseases and leading to quicker breakthroughs in treatment.\n\nAI is transforming the financial industry in several ways, making it more efficient, secure, and personalised for customers. AI algorithms are being used to analyse vast amounts of transaction data, in real-time, to identify suspicious patterns and prevent fraudulent activity.\n\nRobots powered by AI are automating tasks on factory floors, optimising production lines, and improving quality control. By analysing sensor data from machines, AI is being used to predict equipment failures before they happen, enabling preventive maintenance, reducing downtime, and saving companies money.\n\nIndia has a large pool of IT talent, but there's a shortage of skilled professionals in specialised AI fields like machine learning and deep learning. Despite AI's productivity improvements, the net employment isn't likely to change much, but it will create displacements. India should focus on investing in AI education and training programmes to help close this gap. Just like it did in semiconductors, government should proactively encourage collaboration between academia and industry to foster innovation in AI research. The public-private partnerships should be incentivised to develop a robust AI infrastructure by building new data centres with high performance GPU processors, so many professionals can access them for AI model development in an affordable way for the healthcare, drug discovery, and manufacturing industries.\n\nOne of the most crucial use cases for AI pertains to ensuring India's security. India has already begun using AI to strengthen its security infrastructure, by analysing massive amounts of data from security cameras, sensors, and social media to identify potential threats like terrorist activity or cyberattacks. By recognising patterns and anomalies, AI agents can flag suspicious activity, much faster and more effectively than humans can.\n\nIndia should proactively address its border security threats and ensure the safety of its citizens by deploying AI-powered drones and surveillance systems to patrol India's vast borders, detecting illegal crossings and intrusions, in real-time.\n\nIndia should integrate AI into its cyber-security effort. AI is a powerful tool to combat cyber threats. AI algorithms can detect sophisticated cyberattacks, including zero-day attacks, and automate responses to mitigate damage. Additionally, AI can help analyse network traffic and identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.\n\nAI is a powerful tool with immense potential for good, however if misused, AI systems can perpetuate biases present in the data they are trained on. This can lead to damaging outcomes. To harness the power of AI for a better future, government should proactively promote responsible AI adoption and develop ethical guidelines and regulations to address potential biases and privacy concerns.\n\n(Vinod Dham is popularly known as the 'Father of the Pentium Chip' for his contribution to the development of Intel's Pentium microprocessor.)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative pre-trained transformer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_convergence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technological convergence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Turing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Bang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mathematician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Dham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vinod Dham"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Computers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Biometrics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Biometrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112308407,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-52046,overlay-ettech/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

How were educators to make out if a student wrote a term paper or whether ChatGPT spewed it out? Banning its use in educational institutions would prove futile, as students would find ways to access the software. Some professors tried to co-opt ChatGPT into their assignments, asking students to evaluate the bot's response to a question, for example. As its use proliferated, the nefarious side of generative AI was also revealed, as it fabricated claims and exhibited \"hallucinations\". The wunderkind of AI wasn't so wonderful, after all. Like most technologies, AI too is knife-edged, with a plethora of benefits and drawbacks.\n\nIn an article in Financial Times (May 29, 2024), Nicholas Fearn cited a study by an edtech company in which around 60% of the high-school students surveyed confessed to taking help from ChatGPT for assignments ranging from writing essays to solving Maths problems to translating text from one language to another. Some students admitted to getting the bot to write an entire essay, especially when the deadline was looming near. These students were aware that this behaviour constitutes cheating but they haven't yet been pulled up by their teachers.\n\nGreat potential\n\nBut not all students are using AI to beat the system. Some students interviewed by Fearn use ChatGPT as an aid or instructional tool. For example, one student uses it to research a topic more deeply and to get suggestions for further reading and to check his workings on Maths problems.\n\nAn article in Forbes (dated February 21, 2023), by Olufemi Shonubi, discusses the pros and cons of using AI in education. To optimise learning and student outcomes, personalised lessons can allow each student to progress at their own pace and harness their unique interests. By providing instant feedback, students also get a better grip of their errors and how to avoid them.\n\nAI can also support the learning of students with special needs. Features like text to speech and vice versa, spell and grammar checks and software that corrects student's oral reading in real time can enhance student learning and engagement.\n\nWhen AI has immense potential as a teaching and learning tool, how can educators incorporate it while limiting its abuses? Fearn interviews John Morganelli Jr, director of college admissions, Ivy Tutors Network, who avers that educators may give greater weightage to \"real-time assessments\" that may include interviews and in-person testing.\n\nFlip side\n\nWhile AI platforms can facilitate learning, another question that dogs the educational establishment is whether AI can replace human teachers. Regardless of how 'smart' and efficient AI-powered tools may be, they cannot and should not supplant human teachers entirely. The COVID experiment revealed that children do not thrive if they stare at screens all day. We cannot downplay the importance of human contact, interaction and emotionality in the learning process.\n\nThough AI can provide \"personalised learning and instant feedback,\" argues Shonubi, bots cannot provide a rounded education that also addresses our socioemotional needs. As AI grows more sophisticated in its ability to deliver apt and engrossing lessons, teachers may find their role morphing into a coach or mentor rather than an instructor.\n\nAnother important point that Shonubi raises is the question of privacy. While AI may \"collect and store sensitive personal data\", is it fair on young learners to create a digital trail that can tail them for life? Who owns this information? Surely, we cannot allow for-profit edtech companies alone to decide how this information is stored and secured.\n\nEducators and parents need to take a more active role in determining AI's role in education. Given that our children's learning and future are at stake, we need a diverse array of voices to speak up and be heard.\n\nThe writer is the author of Zero Limits: Things Every 20-Something Should Know.

Ever since ChatGPT heralded the explosion of generative AI in late 2022, the technology has seen incredible hype in the industry and media. And countless investors have poured billions and billions of dollars into it and related companies.\n\nBut a growing chorus of naysayers is expressing doubts about how game-changing generative AI will actually be for the economy.\n\nThe discord over AI recently inspired a two-part series on our daily podcast, The Indicator from Planet Money. Co-host Darian Woods and I decided to debate the question: Is AI overrated or underrated?\n\nBecause there is quite a bit of uncertainty over how much AI will ultimately affect the economy -- and because neither of us really wanted to regret making dumb prognostications -- we chose to obscure our personal opinions on the matter. We flipped an AI-generated coin to determine which side of this debate each of us would take. I got \"AI is overrated.\"\n\nI spoke to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu, who has emerged as one of AI's leading skeptics. I asked Acemoglu whether he thought generative AI would usher in revolutionary changes to the economy within the next decade.\n\n\"No. No. Definitely not,\" Acemoglu said. \"I mean, unless you count a lot of companies over-investing in generative AI and then regretting it, a revolutionary change.\"\n\nOuch. That implies we've seen a massive financial bubble inflate before our very eyes (note that this interview was conducted before the recent stock market plunge, which may or may not have something do with expectations about AI).\n\nSo why might AI be overrated? To make my polemical case, I ended up assembling a pretty long list of reasons. We couldn't fit it all in a short episode. So we decided to provide here a fuller list of reasons that AI may be overrated (complete with strongly worded arguments). Here you go:\n\nWhen you first use something like ChatGPT, it might seem like magic. Like, \"Wow, a real thinking machine able to answer questions about anything.\"\n\nBut when you look behind the curtains, it's more like a magic trick. These chatbots are a fancy way of aggregating the internet and then spitting out a mishmash of what they find. Put simply, they're copycats or, at least, fundamentally dependent on mimicking past human work and not capable of generating great new ideas.\n\nAnd perhaps the worst part is that much of the stuff that AI is copying is copyrighted. AI companies took people's work and fed it into their machines, often without authorization. You could argue it's like systematic plagiarism.\n\nThat's why there are at least 15 high-profile lawsuits against AI companies asserting copyright infringement. In one case, The New York Times v. OpenAI, the evidence suggests that, in some instances, ChatGPT literally spit out passages of news articles verbatim without attribution.\n\nFearing that this really is a violation of copyright law, AI companies have begun paying media companies for their content. At the same time, many other companies have been taking actions to prevent AI companies from harvesting their data. This could pose a big problem for these AI models, which rely on human-generated data to cosplay as thinking machines.\n\nThe reality is that generative AI is nowhere near the holy grail of AI researchers -- what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). What we have now, well, is way more lame. As the technologist Dirk Hohndel has said, these models are just \"autocorrect on steroids.\" They are statistical models for prediction based on patterns found in data. Sure, that can have some cool and impressive applications. But \"artificial pattern spotter\" -- or the more traditional \"machine learning\" moniker -- seems like a better description than \"artificial intelligence.\"\n\nThese systems don't have judgment or reasoning. They have a hard time doing basic things like math. They don't know right from wrong. They don't know true from false.\n\nThe AI industry and the media have come to call AI-generated falsehoods and errors \"hallucinations.\" But like the term \"artificial intelligence,\" that might be a misnomer. Because that makes it sound like it, you know, works well almost always -- and then every once in a while, it likes to drink some ayahuasca or eat some mushrooms, and then it says some trippy, made-up stuff.\n\nBut AI hallucinations seem to be more common than that (and, to be fair, a growing number of folks have begun calling them \"confabulations\"). One study suggests that AI chatbots hallucinate -- or confabulate -- somewhere between 3% and 27% of the time. Whoa, looks like AI should lay off the ayahuasca.\n\nAI hallucinations have been creating embarrassments for companies. For example, Google recently had to revamp its \"AI Overviews\" feature after it started making ridiculous errors, like telling users that they should put glue in pizza sauce and that it was healthy to eat rocks. Why did it recommend that people eat rocks? Probably because it had an article from the satirical website The Onion in its training data. Because these systems aren't actually intelligent, that tripped it up.\n\nHallucinations make these systems unreliable. The industry is taking this seriously and working to reduce errors. There may be some progress on that front. But -- because these models don't know true from false and just mindlessly spit out words based on patterns in data -- many AI researchers and technologists out there believe we won't be able to fix the problem of hallucinations anytime soon, if not ever, with these models.\n\nI recently reported a story that asked, \"If AI is so good, why are there still so many jobs for translators?\" Language translation has been at the sort of vanguard of AI research and development for close to a decade or more. And some have predicted that translator jobs would be among the first to be automated away.\n\nBut despite advances in AI, the data suggests that jobs for human translators and interpreters are actually growing. Sure, translators are increasingly using AI as a tool at their jobs. But my reporting revealed that AI is just not smart enough, not socially aware enough and not reliable enough to replace humans most of the time.\n\nAnd this seems to be true for a whole host of other jobs.\n\nFor example, drive-through attendants. For close to three years, McDonald's piloted a program to use AI at some of its drive-throughs. It became a bit of an embarrassment. A bunch of viral videos showed AI making bizarre errors: like trying to add $222 worth of chicken nuggets to someone's order and adding bacon to someone's ice cream.\n\nI like how New York Times journalist Julia Angwin put it. Generative AI, she says, \"could end up like the Roomba, the mediocre vacuum robot that does a passable job when you are home alone but not if you are expecting guests. Companies that can get by with Roomba-quality work will, of course, still try to replace workers. But in workplaces where quality matters ... A.I. may not make significant inroads.\"\n\nYou may remember news stories from last year proclaiming that AI did really well on the Uniform Bar Exam for lawyers. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, claimed that GPT-4 scored in the 90th percentile. But while at MIT, researcher Eric Martinez dug deeper. He found that it scored only in the 48th percentile. Is that actually impressive when these systems, with their ample training data, have the equivalent of a Google search at their fingertips? Heck, maybe even I could score that well if I had access to previous bar exams and other ways to cheat.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, claimed that its AI was able to unearth more than 2 million chemical compounds previously unknown to science. But researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara found that this was mostly bogus. Maybe the study is wrong, or, more likely, maybe the AI industry is overhyping their products' capabilities.\n\nEven more alarming, AI was really touted as being incredible at writing computer code. Like jobs for translators, jobs for computer coders were supposedly in jeopardy because AI was so good at coding. But researchers have found that much of the code that AI generates is not very good. Sure, AI is making coders more productive. But the quality seems to be going down. One study from researchers at Stanford University found that coders who used AI assistants \"wrote significantly less secure code.\" Researchers at Bilkent University found that more than 30% of AI-generated code was incorrect and another 23% of it was partially incorrect.\n\nA recent poll of developers found that roughly half of them had concerns about the quality and security of AI-generated code.\n\nIn a recent study, the U.S. Census Bureau found that only around 5% of businesses had used AI in the previous couple of weeks. Which relates to ...\n\nThe relatively small percentage of companies that are actually using AI don't seem to be using it in a way that is going to have profound benefits for our economy. Some are experimenting with it. But of those that have incorporated it into their day-to-day business, it's mostly in things like personalized marketing and automated customer service. Not very exciting.\n\nIn fact, I don't know about you, but I'd rather talk to a human customer service agent than a chatbot. Acemoglu has called this sort of automation \"so-so automation,\" where companies replace humans with machines not because they're better or more productive but because it saves them money. Like self-checkout kiosks at grocery stores, AI chatbots in customer service often just shift more work to customers. It can be frustrating.\n\nSo, yeah, we're not seeing a killer app for AI yet. Actually, it's feasible that the most impactful real-world applications of AI will be scams, misinformation and threatening democracy. Overrated!\n\nIf AI was really revolutionizing the economy, we'd likely see a surge in productivity growth and an increase in unemployment. But the surge in productivity growth is nowhere to be seen. And unemployment is at near-record lows. Even for the white-collar jobs that AI is most likely to affect, we're not seeing evidence of AI killing them.\n\nWhile generative AI may be incapable of replacing humans in most or virtually all jobs, it clearly can help humans in some professions as an information tool. And, you might say, its productivity benefits could take time to filter throughout the economy.\n\nBut there are good reasons to believe that generative AI won't revolutionize our economy anytime soon.\n\nIn a recent paper, Acemoglu estimated generative AI's potential effects on the economy over the next decade. \"The paper was written out of a belief that some of the effects of AI are being exaggerated,\" Acemoglu says.\n\nFirst off, Acemoglu says, there are just humongous chunks of the economy that generative AI will barely touch. Construction, food and accommodations, factories and so on. Generative AI, in Acemoglu's view, will be unable to do most tasks outside of an office within the next decade. (Note that generative AI is distinct from the technology behind self-driving cars, what's known as \"reinforcement learning.\" Acemoglu says he has little doubt that self-driving cars are coming, but he's unsure about the timeline. His focus in this recent paper is new AI advances that have captured our collective imagination over the last couple of years.)\n\nThen Acemoglu narrows in on office work and finds that there are just a whole bunch of tasks that current AI models are incapable of doing. They're just too dumb and unreliable. At best, they're proving to be just a tool that office workers can use to -- maybe -- become slightly better at their jobs. Acemoglu finds that AI will impact less than 5% of human tasks in the economy. Less than 5%! And, here, there will be only some mild cost savings.\n\nIn the end, Acemoglu predicts that generative AI won't boost productivity or economic growth much within the next decade. He estimates that, at best, it could increase gross domestic product by around 1.5% over 10 years. That's \"nothing to be sneered at,\" Acemoglu says. \"But it's not revolutionary in any shape or form.\"\n\nWhenever we talk about AI, the conversation always seems to turn to the future.\n\nLike, sure, it's not that good yet. But in a few years, we're all gonna be out of work and bowing down to our robot overlords or whatever. But where is the evidence that points to that? Is this just our collective conditioning by science fiction movies?\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about AI improving really fast. Some claim it's getting exponentially better. Others even claim these models -- highfalutin autocomplete -- are the road to AGI, or artificial superintelligence.\n\nBut there are serious questions about all of this. In fact, evidence suggests that the rate of progress in AI may be slowing down.\n\nFirst, progress in making these models better has depended, in large part, on throwing lots and lots of data at them. One big problem: They've already basically consumed the entire internet.\n\nAnd, as already stated, that included consuming a bunch of copyrighted works. What happens if the courts say, \"No way, you can't just use copyrighted data without authorization?\"\n\nMeanwhile, companies, annoyed by AI's penchant for expropriating their data, have started restricting use of their data. One group of researchers recently called it an \"emerging crisis in consent.\"\n\nStill more, there are questions about the quality of the data in these systems. Maybe sites like The Onion and 4chan, while helping these systems mimic online humans, may not help them have real, beneficial applications in the economy.\n\nBut even if AI companies get over these humps, there's the reality that there's only so much data out there. Researchers are scrambling to figure out ways to get more data. They're talking about things like creating \"synthetic data\" and so on. But progress on this front is a big question mark.\n\nSecond, there's a scarcity of the special microchips needed to power AI. That's another huge cost and headache for AI companies. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has been trying to convince investors to fork over trillions of dollars -- trillions! -- to revamp the global semiconductor industry and make other investments to improve ChatGPT. Is it worth it? Will investors actually get their money back? I dunno.\n\nThird, the data centers that power AI require an ungodly amount of electricity. This is a huge cost for these companies. Are they going to be able to recoup the money it takes to build and power all these data centers? Will consumers be willing to pay the high cost of running AI? It's a fundamental problem with these companies' business model. But it's also a fundamental problem for America's electricity grid and the environment.\n\nAI already consumes enough energy to power a small country. Researchers at Goldman Sachs found that \"the proliferation of generative AI technology -- and the data centers needed to feed it -- is set to drive an increase in US power demand not seen in a generation.\"\n\n\"One of the silliest things around a couple of years ago was this idea that AI would help solve the climate change problem,\" Acemoglu says. \"I never understood exactly how. But, you know, it's clear it's gonna do something to climate change, but it's not on the positive side.\"\n\nWhen I asked Acemoglu for his top reasons why AI was overrated, he told me something that warmed my heart -- a feeling that dumb \"artificial intelligence\" could never experience.\n\nAcemoglu told me he believed AI is overrated because humans are underrated. \"So a lot of people in the industry don't recognize how versatile, talented, multifaceted human skills and capabilities are,\" Acemoglu says. \"And once you do that, you tend to overrate machines ahead of humans and underrate the humans.\"\n\nMajor caveat to all of the above: I've made the strongest case against generative AI that I could make because that was my assignment (thanks to an AI-generated coin flip).\n\nThere are countless investors and technologists and economists out there who are bullish on this technology (for some of those arguments, listen to my colleague Darian Woods' episode on why AI is underrated, or read some of my previous newsletters that probe potential upsides and benefits of AI technology).\n\nGoing forward, I will go back to being less derisive and more open-minded to the pros and cons of this technology -- at least until our AI robot overlords take over the Planet Money newsletter and destroy my livelihood.", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

And while most business leaders surveyed agreed it's important to keep up to date with regulations and guidance around AI use and management; the U.S. finds it to be the most important compared to other markets at 69% agreement.\n\nLeaders in the U.S. (59%) and Germany (55%) place high importance on involving employees in testing and trialing new AI tools, compared with 31% in the UK and Japan.

Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nIs artificial intelligence overrated? Ever since ChatGPT heralded the explosion of generative AI in late 2022, the technology has seen incredible hype in the industry and media. And countless investors have poured billions and billions of dollars into it and related companies.\n\nBut a growing chorus of naysayers is expressing doubts about how game-changing generative AI will actually be for the economy.\n\nThe discord over AI recently inspired a two-part series on our daily podcast, The Indicator from Planet Money. Co-host Darian Woods and I decided to debate the question: Is AI overrated or underrated?\n\nBecause there is quite a bit of uncertainty over how much AI will ultimately affect the economy -- and because neither of us really wanted to regret making dumb prognostications -- we chose to obscure our personal opinions on the matter. We flipped an AI-generated coin to determine which side of this debate each of us would take. I got \"AI is overrated.\"\n\nI spoke to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu, who has emerged as one of AI's leading skeptics. I asked Acemoglu whether he thought generative AI would usher in revolutionary changes to the economy within the next decade.\n\n\"No. No. Definitely not,\" Acemoglu said. \"I mean, unless you count a lot of companies over-investing in generative AI and then regretting it, a revolutionary change.\"\n\nOuch. That implies we've seen a massive financial bubble inflate before our very eyes (note that this interview was conducted before the recent stock market plunge, which may or may not have something do with expectations about AI).\n\nSo why might AI be overrated? To make my polemical case, I ended up assembling a pretty long list of reasons. We couldn't fit it all in a short episode. So we decided to provide here a fuller list of reasons that AI may be overrated (complete with strongly worded arguments). Here you go:\n\nWhen you first use something like ChatGPT, it might seem like magic. Like, \"Wow, a real thinking machine able to answer questions about anything.\"\n\nBut when you look behind the curtains, it's more like a magic trick. These chatbots are a fancy way of aggregating the internet and then spitting out a mishmash of what they find. Put simply, they're copycats or, at least, fundamentally dependent on mimicking past human work and not capable of generating great new ideas.\n\nAnd perhaps the worst part is that much of the stuff that AI is copying is copyrighted. AI companies took people's work and fed it into their machines, often without authorization. You could argue it's like systematic plagiarism.\n\nThat's why there are at least 15 high-profile lawsuits against AI companies asserting copyright infringement. In one case, The New York Times v. OpenAI, the evidence suggests that, in some instances, ChatGPT literally spit out passages of news articles verbatim without attribution.\n\nFearing that this really is a violation of copyright law, AI companies have begun paying media companies for their content. At the same time, many other companies have been taking actions to prevent AI companies from harvesting their data. This could pose a big problem for these AI models, which rely on human-generated data to cosplay as thinking machines.\n\nThe reality is that generative AI is nowhere near the holy grail of AI researchers -- what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). What we have now, well, is way more lame. As the technologist Dirk Hohndel has said, these models are just \"autocorrect on steroids.\" They are statistical models for prediction based on patterns found in data. Sure, that can have some cool and impressive applications. But \"artificial pattern spotter\" -- or the more traditional \"machine learning\" moniker -- seems like a better description than \"artificial intelligence.\"\n\nThese systems don't have judgment or reasoning. They have a hard time doing basic things like math. They don't know right from wrong. They don't know true from false.\n\nWhich brings us to ...\n\nThe AI industry and the media have come to call AI-generated falsehoods and errors \"hallucinations.\" But like the term \"artificial intelligence,\" that might be a misnomer. Because that makes it sound like it, you know, works well almost always -- and then every once in a while, it likes to drink some ayahuasca or eat some mushrooms, and then it says some trippy, made-up stuff.\n\nBut AI hallucinations seem to be more common than that (and, to be fair, a growing number of folks have begun calling them \"confabulations\"). One study suggests that AI chatbots hallucinate -- or confabulate -- somewhere between 3% and 27% of the time. Whoa, looks like AI should lay off the ayahuasca.\n\nAI hallucinations have been creating embarrassments for companies. For example, Google recently had to revamp its \"AI Overviews\" feature after it started making ridiculous errors, like telling users that they should put glue in pizza sauce and that it was healthy to eat rocks. Why did it recommend that people eat rocks? Probably because it had an article from the satirical website The Onion in its training data. Because these systems aren't actually intelligent, that tripped it up.\n\nHallucinations make these systems unreliable. The industry is taking this seriously and working to reduce errors. There may be some progress on that front. But -- because these models don't know true from false and just mindlessly spit out words based on patterns in data -- many AI researchers and technologists out there believe we won't be able to fix the problem of hallucinations anytime soon, if not ever, with these models.\n\nI recently reported a story that asked, \"If AI is so good, why are there still so many jobs for translators?\" Language translation has been at the sort of vanguard of AI research and development for close to a decade or more. And some have predicted that translator jobs would be among the first to be automated away.\n\nBut despite advances in AI, the data suggests that jobs for human translators and interpreters are actually growing. Sure, translators are increasingly using AI as a tool at their jobs. But my reporting revealed that AI is just not smart enough, not socially aware enough and not reliable enough to replace humans most of the time.\n\nAnd this seems to be true for a whole host of other jobs.\n\nFor example, drive-through attendants. For close to three years, McDonald's piloted a program to use AI at some of its drive-throughs. It became a bit of an embarrassment. A bunch of viral videos showed AI making bizarre errors: like trying to add $222 worth of chicken nuggets to someone's order and adding bacon to someone's ice cream.\n\nI like how New York Times journalist Julia Angwin put it. Generative AI, she says, \"could end up like the Roomba, the mediocre vacuum robot that does a passable job when you are home alone but not if you are expecting guests. Companies that can get by with Roomba-quality work will, of course, still try to replace workers. But in workplaces where quality matters ... A.I. may not make significant inroads.\"\n\nYou may remember news stories from last year proclaiming that AI did really well on the Uniform Bar Exam for lawyers. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, claimed that GPT-4 scored in the 90th percentile. But while at MIT, researcher Eric Martinez dug deeper. He found that it scored only in the 48th percentile. Is that actually impressive when these systems, with their ample training data, have the equivalent of a Google search at their fingertips? Heck, maybe even I could score that well if I had access to previous bar exams and other ways to cheat.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, claimed that its AI was able to unearth more than 2 million chemical compounds previously unknown to science. But researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara found that this was mostly bogus. Maybe the study is wrong, or, more likely, maybe the AI industry is overhyping their products' capabilities.\n\nEven more alarming, AI was really touted as being incredible at writing computer code. Like jobs for translators, jobs for computer coders were supposedly in jeopardy because AI was so good at coding. But researchers have found that much of the code that AI generates is not very good. Sure, AI is making coders more productive. But the quality seems to be going down. One study from researchers at Stanford University found that coders who used AI assistants \"wrote significantly less secure code.\" Researchers at Bilkent University found that more than 30% of AI-generated code was incorrect and another 23% of it was partially incorrect.\n\nA recent poll of developers found that roughly half of them had concerns about the quality and security of AI-generated code.\n\nIn a recent study, the U.S. Census Bureau found that only around 5% of businesses had used AI in the previous couple of weeks. Which relates to ...\n\nThe relatively small percentage of companies that are actually using AI don't seem to be using it in a way that is going to have profound benefits for our economy. Some are experimenting with it. But of those that have incorporated it into their day-to-day business, it's mostly in things like personalized marketing and automated customer service. Not very exciting.\n\nIn fact, I don't know about you, but I'd rather talk to a human customer service agent than a chatbot. Acemoglu has called this sort of automation \"so-so automation,\" where companies replace humans with machines not because they're better or more productive but because it saves them money. Like self-checkout kiosks at grocery stores, AI chatbots in customer service often just shift more work to customers. It can be frustrating.\n\nSo, yeah, we're not seeing a killer app for AI yet. Actually, it's feasible that the most impactful real-world applications of AI will be scams, misinformation and threatening democracy. Overrated!\n\nIf AI was really revolutionizing the economy, we'd likely see a surge in productivity growth and an increase in unemployment. But the surge in productivity growth is nowhere to be seen. And unemployment is at near-record lows. Even for the white-collar jobs that AI is most likely to affect, we're not seeing evidence of AI killing them.\n\nWhile generative AI may be incapable of replacing humans in most or virtually all jobs, it clearly can help humans in some professions as an information tool. And, you might say, its productivity benefits could take time to filter throughout the economy.\n\nBut there are good reasons to believe that generative AI won't revolutionize our economy anytime soon.\n\nIn a recent paper, Acemoglu estimated generative AI's potential effects on the economy over the next decade. \"The paper was written out of a belief that some of the effects of AI are being exaggerated,\" Acemoglu says.\n\nFirst off, Acemoglu says, there are just humongous chunks of the economy that generative AI will barely touch. Construction, food and accommodations, factories and so on. Generative AI, in Acemoglu's view, will be unable to do most tasks outside of an office within the next decade. (Note that generative AI is distinct from the technology behind self-driving cars, what's known as \"reinforcement learning.\" Acemoglu says he has little doubt that self-driving cars are coming, but he's unsure about the timeline. His focus in this recent paper is new AI advances that have captured our collective imagination over the last couple of years.)\n\nThen Acemoglu narrows in on office work and finds that there are just a whole bunch of tasks that current AI models are incapable of doing. They're just too dumb and unreliable. At best, they're proving to be just a tool that office workers can use to -- maybe -- become slightly better at their jobs. Acemoglu finds that AI will impact less than 5% of human tasks in the economy. Less than 5%! And, here, there will be only some mild cost savings.\n\nIn the end, Acemoglu predicts that generative AI won't boost productivity or economic growth much within the next decade. He estimates that, at best, it could increase gross domestic product by around 1.5% over 10 years. That's \"nothing to be sneered at,\" Acemoglu says. \"But it's not revolutionary in any shape or form.\"\n\nWhenever we talk about AI, the conversation always seems to turn to the future.\n\nLike, sure, it's not that good yet. But in a few years, we're all gonna be out of work and bowing down to our robot overlords or whatever. But where is the evidence that points to that? Is this just our collective conditioning by science fiction movies?\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about AI improving really fast. Some claim it's getting exponentially better. Others even claim these models -- highfalutin autocomplete -- are the road to AGI, or artificial superintelligence.\n\nBut there are serious questions about all of this. In fact, evidence suggests that the rate of progress in AI may be slowing down.\n\nFirst, progress in making these models better has depended, in large part, on throwing lots and lots of data at them. One big problem: They've already basically consumed the entire internet.\n\nAnd, as already stated, that included consuming a bunch of copyrighted works. What happens if the courts say, \"No way, you can't just use copyrighted data without authorization?\"\n\nMeanwhile, companies, annoyed by AI's penchant for expropriating their data, have started restricting use of their data. One group of researchers recently called it an \"emerging crisis in consent.\"\n\nStill more, there are questions about the quality of the data in these systems. Maybe sites like The Onion and 4chan, while helping these systems mimic online humans, may not help them have real, beneficial applications in the economy.\n\nBut even if AI companies get over these humps, there's the reality that there's only so much data out there. Researchers are scrambling to figure out ways to get more data. They're talking about things like creating \"synthetic data\" and so on. But progress on this front is a big question mark.\n\nSecond, there's a scarcity of the special microchips needed to power AI. That's another huge cost and headache for AI companies. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has been trying to convince investors to fork over trillions of dollars -- trillions! -- to revamp the global semiconductor industry and make other investments to improve ChatGPT. Is it worth it? Will investors actually get their money back? I dunno.\n\nThird, the data centers that power AI require an ungodly amount of electricity. This is a huge cost for these companies. Are they going to be able to recoup the money it takes to build and power all these data centers? Will consumers be willing to pay the high cost of running AI? It's a fundamental problem with these companies' business model. But it's also a fundamental problem for America's electricity grid and the environment.\n\nAI already consumes enough energy to power a small country. Researchers at Goldman Sachs found that \"the proliferation of generative AI technology -- and the data centers needed to feed it -- is set to drive an increase in US power demand not seen in a generation.\"\n\n\"One of the silliest things around a couple of years ago was this idea that AI would help solve the climate change problem,\" Acemoglu says. \"I never understood exactly how. But, you know, it's clear it's gonna do something to climate change, but it's not on the positive side.\"\n\nWhen I asked Acemoglu for his top reasons why AI was overrated, he told me something that warmed my heart -- a feeling that dumb \"artificial intelligence\" could never experience.\n\nAcemoglu told me he believed AI is overrated because humans are underrated. \"So a lot of people in the industry don't recognize how versatile, talented, multifaceted human skills and capabilities are,\" Acemoglu says. \"And once you do that, you tend to overrate machines ahead of humans and underrate the humans.\"\n\nMajor caveat to all of the above: I've made the strongest case against generative AI that I could make because that was my assignment (thanks to an AI-generated coin flip).\n\nThere are countless investors and technologists and economists out there who are bullish on this technology (for some of those arguments, listen to my colleague Darian Woods' episode on why AI is underrated, or read some of my previous newsletters that probe potential upsides and benefits of AI technology).\n\nGoing forward, I will go back to being less derisive and more open-minded to the pros and cons of this technology -- at least until our AI robot overlords take over the Planet Money newsletter and destroy my livelihood.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

The pressure is on, given that after more than six years of deliberation and negotiation, the EU AI Act will come into action on August 1st. Just days before the speech, it was reported that the AI bill was going to be one of the 35 bills included in the speech.\n\nBut there was no mention of such a bill. Now, it is key that the UK plots its own sovereign course, but the 'Brussels effect' of EU AI regulation is something to reckon with - or at least to take inspiration from. Citizen and consumer interests aside, there is one thing that even the most regulation-averse businesses dislike more than legislation: uncertainty. What shape could such regulation take, stimulating innovations in trustworthy AI and balancing the needs of businesses, public organizations, citizens, and consumers?\n\nThe sole mention of AI in the King's Speech was that the government will \"seek to establish the appropriate legislation to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models.\" These are the so-called 'frontier' generative AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT, Google Gemini, and Meta's herd of LlaMA models. The EU also caters to these models, but the scope of that legislation includes all forms of AI, including smaller models and non-generative AI.\n\nThis is important as most of the AI in use today falls into that category. Risk is not just caused by the largest and smartest models but also by the not-so-smart use of more limited AI models and AI systems. The real threat is not coming from AI superintelligence but from basic artificial unintelligence.\n\nTake, for example, a commercial risk model that is used in US healthcare to guide prevention and care decisions. According to a research article published in Science, this model was originally trained to predict (future) healthcare spending for a patient to a reasonably high accuracy. However, the issue was that spending is a biased measure for the level of illness: less money is spent on black patients versus non-black patients with similar health conditions. By predicting chronic illness instead, the algorithm selects 2.5 times more black patients.\n\nThe lesson here is not that we shouldn't innovate healthcare with AI, as it can be a very useful tool for prevention, operations, and clinical diagnosis. The lesson is that for purposes like these, where there is a lot at stake or a substantial risk of harm, higher levels of scrutiny apply, such as requiring checks for ethical bias, proper transparency, documentation, etc.\n\nThis is exactly the route that the EU Act has taken and something that future UK regulation could take inspiration from. Ensure that all forms of AI are covered by legislation, not just generative AI or frontier models, yet take a very pragmatic, risk-based approach where high-risk uses of AI are held to higher standards.\n\nThis is good for citizens and consumers, but also for business and the economy, and it would increase consumer trust as these systems and uses become worthy of our trust. It would foster, not hinder, the innovation of sector-based, responsible use of AI.

Learn More\n\nS&P Global, the financial data powerhouse, is making an audacious bet on artificial intelligence that could reshape how Wall Street analyzes data and makes decisions. In a sweeping initiative announced today, the company is partnering with Accenture to train all 35,000 of its employees in generative AI skills, a move that signals just how transformative S&P Global believes this technology will be for the financial services industry.\n\n\"AI is for everyone,\" Bhavesh Dayalji, S&P Global's chief AI officer, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"That's exactly why we wanted to partner with Accenture: We want to bring this to all of our employees, whether they're in the finance function, the legal function, or a salesperson looking to understand their customers [better].\"\n\nThis isn't just a simple tech upgrade. S&P Global is positioning itself at the forefront of a seismic shift in how financial professionals work, from junior analysts to C-suite executives. The company envisions a future where AI doesn't just crunch numbers faster, but generates new insights and ideas that could give its clients a competitive edge.\n\nThe AI academy: Wall Street's new Ivy League\n\nThe centerpiece of this initiative is a comprehensive generative AI learning program developed in collaboration with Accenture. Set to launch this month, the program will use Accenture's LearnVantage platform to deliver customized content tailored to S&P Global's specific needs.\n\n\"You can't use ChatGPT a couple of times and consider yourself a generative AI expert,\" Dayalji said. \"That's why we built this comprehensive program to teach people about what generative AI is, how it's different from traditional AI, and how they can use it as part of their workflow.\"\n\nThe partnership goes beyond employee training. S&P Global and Accenture plan to develop new AI benchmarks and tools for the entire financial services industry. It's a savvy move that could make S&P Global the go-to source for AI-powered financial analysis.\n\nS&P Global has already begun this transformation. Its internal \"Spark Assist\" platform and customer-facing Chat AI are early examples of how the company sees AI augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it.\n\n\"We've built vibrant communities... engaging and telling us what's working well, and what's not,\" Dayalji explained. \"They're sharing with us things like, 'Wow, I've been able to generate an application that does specific data extraction tasks, that improves how quickly I can complete that task.' So you can measure the time to market part really easily. Where ordinarily a person would tell you, 'Hey, I would take like two weeks to do something like this,' now I can do it in a matter of a day.\"\n\nFrom number crunchers to insight alchemists: The new Wall Street workforce\n\nThe potential impact of this AI push is significant. Some employees report time savings of up to 50% on certain tasks. But the true value, according to Dayalji, lies in freeing up experts to focus on higher-value work.\n\n\"My view has always been that AI is for all, and what I really wanted to do is create opportunities for our people to do higher-value work, that differentiated work,\" he said. \"We have domain experts here with decades of knowledge in specific industries like financial services and oil and gas markets. The aim for me is: I don't want them to do the mundane work.\"\n\nThis move comes at a critical time for S&P Global. As tech giants like Microsoft and Google race to integrate AI into their products, financial data providers can't afford to be left behind. S&P Global is betting that its vast troves of proprietary financial data, combined with advanced AI capabilities, will give it a unique advantage.\n\n\"We're integral to this part of the shift that's happening,\" Dayalji said. \"We're building these generative AI applications and leveraging our data. So we're kind of sticky and part of that workflow.\"\n\nHowever, challenges remain. The rapid pace of AI development, concerns about data privacy, and the need for model accuracy in high-stakes financial decisions are all hurdles that S&P Global will need to navigate.\n\nThe AI crystal ball: Predicting success in an uncertain ruture\n\nThere's also the question of how to measure success. While some productivity gains are immediately apparent, Dayalji acknowledges that the true impact may take time to manifest on the balance sheet.\n\n\"In the coming years, we're going to have to start seeing it kind of show up in our balance sheets,\" he said. \"How does it change the composition of our teams? What do they work on?\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Dayalji remains optimistic about the transformative potential of generative AI. \"This shift is coming,\" he insisted. \"I think that there's a slight impatience that it should be here already. And I think like any technology shift, it might take longer than you think. But then when it really starts picking up steam, it's going to happen really quickly.\"\n\nThe implications of this initiative extend far beyond S&P Global. As one of the largest providers of financial data and analytics, the company's embrace of AI could accelerate adoption across the financial services industry. Competitors, clients, and regulators will all be watching closely to see how this ambitious bet plays out.\n\nIn the end, S&P Global's AI push is not just about improving its own operations. It's about reshaping how the entire financial industry operates in an AI-driven future. As Dayalji put it, \"I think what we really need to be thinking about is, how is our lives going to change? And how do we want AI to play a role in making our lives better both society at large, but also in our companies?\"\n\nWith its all-in AI strategy, S&P Global isn't just betting on the future of finance -- it's aiming to be the house that always wins.", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_nunez@venturebeat.com", "name": "Michael Nu\u00f1ez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureBeat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "VentureBeat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/nuneybits_Robot_at_the_New_York_Stock_Exchange_Wall_Street_trad_70cf5b13-cd01-4c47-8905-db646ea5157f.webp?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

These two categories serve different purposes and are foundational to how AI functions in various applications.\n\nGenerative AI (GenAI) models are designed to generate data, hence the name. They can generate text, images, music, and more, mimicking the style and structure of the input data they were trained on. The most common examples of generative AI today are chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude and image generation tools such as DALL-E and Midjourney. Now we also have generative music from Udio and sound and voices from Eleven Labs. These tools are capable of producing coherent and contextually relevant responses in natural language or creating realistic images, music, and sound from textual descriptions.\n\nDiscriminative AI, on the other hand, is focused on distinguishing between different kinds of data. It classifies input data into predefined categories. Outside of its uses in data analysis, one of the most pervasive uses of discriminative AI is in recommender systems. Applications like Waze, Netflix, YouTube, Facebook newsfeeds, and Google search results rely heavily on discriminative models. These systems analyze user behavior and preferences to recommend routes, movies, videos, news articles, or search results that are most likely to be of interest.\n\nThe mechanism behind AI: Machine learning\n\nAt the core of both generative and discriminative AI is machine learning (ML). ML is the mechanism that enables AI to learn from data and improve over time. It involves training algorithms on large datasets to recognize patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes.\n\nThere are various types of ML, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each suited to different kinds of tasks.\n\n* Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the correct output is known. This approach is often used in classification and regression tasks. Examples include models that detect faces, identify cats and dogs in photos, or forecast sales from past data.\n\n* Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the data. Clustering and association are common unsupervised learning tasks. These are models that group populations into segments, match products to customers, and identify anomalies for fraud detection.\n\n* Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make a sequence of decisions by rewarding desirable actions and penalizing undesirable ones. This approach is frequently used in robotics and game playing. The infamous AlphaGo that beat Lee Sedol, the world master in Go, is an example of a reinforcement learning application. The amazing Boston Dynamics robot dogs and humanoids also use reinforcement learning to learn how to walk life-like in varying terrains and environments.\n\nData science: The intersection of AI and analytics\n\nData science is the discipline that encompasses AI, machine learning, and analytics. It involves using statistical methods, computational tools, and domain expertise to extract insights from data.\n\nData science is the backbone of AI, providing the techniques and processes required to build and refine AI models. Analytics is the use of data to aid in human decisions, while AI primarily concerns itself with automated decision-making, subject to human-defined parameters.\n\nThe rise in popularity of data science and the data scientist as an occupation in recent years is arguably a contributor to the mainstream popularity of AI today.\n\nAI is mainstream\n\nFinally, as many generative AI tools are immediately usable without writing programming code, AI has truly become mainstream, which for me implies that all occupations should be into artificial intelligence, not just data scientists.\n\nGenAI can even be the gateway for the public to learn more about AI itself, and become the new mandatory skill in every CV, alongside word processing, spreadsheets, and the internet.\n\nI will confess that all this information can be a lot to absorb at first read, but hopefully, by understanding these core aspects of AI, machine learning, and data science, we can move past the jargon and grasp the true potential and limitations of these technologies.\n\nThis knowledge enables us to appreciate how AI-driven systems impact our daily lives, from personalized recommendations on streaming services to advanced chatbots that facilitate customer support.", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A recent survey found that employees at software firms with access to generative AI tools increased their productivity by 14%. Used to reimagine operations, increase efficiency and achieve business goals, AI can redefine the future of work.\n\nAs the CEO of a sales performance software provider, I see the impact of AI every day, whether it be how my company innovates around new products and offerings or how we leverage AI internally to drive internal performance and efficiency. Even in the early stages of this new technology innovation, generative AI proves that it can dramatically improve the user experience and effectiveness of enterprise applications. Companies that lean into generative AI will benefit from an inevitable technology sea change that will lift human productivity.\n\nIn the sales industry, AI is revolutionizing sales software and enabling users to leverage vast amounts of data. This AI-driven technology can analyze performance metrics, communication patterns and sales methodologies to help sales professionals enhance their techniques and forecast accurately. When used strategically, AI can provide a competitive advantage to sales organizations by empowering professionals to work smarter and secure better results through the utilization of data-driven insights, automation and predictive analytics.\n\nSeven in ten sales professionals agree that AI tools will make them more productive at work. AI can identify relevant patterns and trends, enabling executives to make better, informed decisions. By leveraging AI to analyze historical data and market trends, sales organizations can:\n\n* Interpret data faster. AI will utilize performance data to extract information and deliver concise summaries so executives can make decisions faster.\n\n* Motivate employees. Sales representatives can be motivated with performance insights and guidance to speed up their deal cycle. For instance, a rep could request details on their top deals sorted by opportunity health, and they'd receive that information in seconds.\n\n* Assist in hiring and retaining team members. By analyzing data indicators, AI can provide recommendations on onboarding new members onto the team faster. Additionally, AI can help identify at-risk employees and give insight into how to improve their performance.\n\n* Automate workflows. AI can assist with day-to-day tasks, like prospecting, with automated processes, reports, reminders and alerts. This allows sales organizations to refocus their time on the people, activities and insights that make the most significant impact.\n\n* Uncover errors and risks. AI-driven software can identify potential problems, like calculation errors, and take action for compensation administrators, increasing operational efficiencies. Additionally, finance professionals can use AI to detect financial risks and strategically course-correct.\n\n* Increase cross-selling and upselling opportunities. Analyzing customer buying behaviors through AI can illuminate potential cross-selling and upselling opportunities, which can lead to increased revenue streams.\n\n* Create accurate sales forecasts. Sales organizations can produce precise sales forecasts by analyzing historical data and market trends. Additionally, AI can enhance a forecasting model by analyzing specific deals to find the highest-correlated combination of indicators out of hundreds of options.\n\nAs 68% of sales professionals predict most software will have built-in AI capabilities in 2024, AI will become an increasingly natural part of business functions, with more integrations likely to follow. Before taking advantage of AI-driven sales technology, companies must compile their data from all available sources and undergo data cleanups to ensure accurate information. Without clean data, users would be unable to leverage this technology's advantages and optimize planning and strategy.\n\nWhen implementing AI, sales organizations must also comply with regulations and safeguard customer data from malicious intent. Concerning biases, business leaders can avoid bias and ensure fairness in their AI algorithms by using a robust and diverse dataset. Additionally, investing in education and training programs is crucial to teaching teams how to use AI responsibly while aligning with values and ethical standards.\n\nWhen speaking with go-to-market (GTM) executives, my team and I always stress that generative AI initiatives should be designed with the end in mind. As a result, we recommend that companies start by building and forming goals regarding the ideal end-state they want to achieve over the next three to five years. Afterward, break up and divide the journey to that goal into a set of phases, with each phase containing a set of deliverables and objectives.\n\nBased on such a framework, GTM teams can quickly assess where generative AI can be the most helpful in building business value. We have found this \"business value first, technology selection later\" approach to the implementation of generative AI to be beneficial in prioritizing investment areas and aligning projects with the actual capabilities of offerings in the marketplace.\n\nWhen implementing any new technology, hurdles will always appear. One challenge that impacts our team often is typically at the very beginning of, or even before, implementation: businesses' and their employees' perception of AI adoption. Humans are often skeptical about how technology could outperform their own natural intuition. If it does, that means major implications for their workforce. However, leaders should remember that AI does not replace the human component of making a sale; rather, it enhances it through data analysis and automated strategy building. If companies lag in adopting AI, they may fall behind their competitors quickly.\n\nLooking into the near future, I believe data-driven sales leadership will be essential for success, with AI playing a crucial role. AI sales technology can provide critical insights based on historical data, revolutionizing how businesses manage and optimize their revenue ecosystem. AI provides sales organizations with unprecedented productivity boosts and streamlined workflows, ultimately increasing business efficiency.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

Rajiv Srivatsa, partner at Antler, shared the news on X, emphasising: \"NOW is the best time to build a startup in India!\"\n\nSimilarly, last month Google introduced several initiatives to enhance AI development in India, including a partnership with the MeitY Startup Hub to train 10,000 startups.\n\nAt the Google I/O Connect Bengaluru 2024 event, the tech giant introduced the 2024 Class of the Google for Startups Accelerator: AI First program in India. This cohort includes 20 exceptional AI-first startups from diverse sectors such as gaming and manufacturing, chosen from over 1,030 applications nationwide.\n\nEarlier in March, there were reports that suggested India will partner with chip-making giant NVIDIA to procure up to 10,000 of its GPUs and NPUs and offer them at subsidised rates to local startups, researchers, academic institutions, and other users in a bid to boost the AI infrastructure in India.\n\nFurther, even the JioGenNext team invests substantial time in collaborating with AI startups to offer comprehensive support and strategic insights tailored to their needs and challenges. The latest cohort, MAP'24, also featured 10 generative AI startups across sectors like healthcare, banking, legal services, and agriculture.\n\nThe Indian government is also playing a pivotal role in fostering AI growth.\n\nThe US-India AI Initiative by IUSSTF, aims to foster AI growth through idea exchange and collaboration in crucial sectors like energy, health, and agriculture.\n\nAdditionally, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs announced MCA 3.0 to streamline regulatory filing using AI, and the Responsible AI for Youth program by MeitY aims to impart AI skills to government school students, enhancing their employability and practical knowledge.\n\nNot just the central, state governments are taking matters into their own hands. For example, the Telangana government launched the INAI (Intel AI) research centre in collaboration with IIT Hyderabad and the Public Health Foundation of India. This centre focuses on using AI to tackle healthcare and smart mobility challenges, particularly in rural and difficult terrains.\n\nAdditionally, the state government has become the first in India to develop AI models in a regional language. In collaboration with Swecha, it is creating a Telugu language model, involving 100,000 students in a datathon to gather high-quality data.\n\nIn the last six months alone, 43 Indian AI startups received $864 million in funding, according to data from AIM Research.\n\nAmong these startups, Ema, an enterprise AI startup, raised $36 million in Series A funding.\n\nBengaluru-based Simplismart, founded by Amritanshu Jain and Devansh Ghatak, raised $7 million in a funding round led by Accel, with participation from existing investors, including Anicut Capital, First Cheque, Sunn91, and Shastra VC.\n\nAnother Bengaluru-based AI startup, Unscript, has raised over $1.25 million to date, which has been pivotal in developing its platform and expanding its market reach.\n\nAdditionally, Bloq Quantum, an AI quantum software startup, secured INR 1.3 crore in a pre-seed round led by Inflection Point Ventures. Meanwhile, Ascendion, a provider of digital engineering services, reported a remarkable 382% increase in generative AI revenue in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in the previous year.\n\nNot to forget, an old but important update, in a significant milestone for the Indian AI sector, Ola-backed Krutrim became India's first AI startup to achieve unicorn status with a $50 million funding boost.\n\nIn terms of AI acquisitions, Protect AI acquired Bengaluru-based SydeLabs for $25 million to enhance LLM security.\n\nC5i acquired Bengaluru-based Analytic Edge for $20 million, marking its second Indian acquisition after Incivus, to enhance AI-driven marketing and sales solutions, as the firm aims for a INR 1000 crore turnover and a future listing in India.\n\nComing down to AI partnerships, CoRover.ai recently partnered with AI auditing firm EthosAI.one to benchmark BharatGPT against industry leaders like GPT-4, Llama 2, and Gemini, ensuring reliability, fairness, and accuracy through continuous auditing and enhancements.\n\nKarya partnered with Microsoft Research to build one of the largest multilingual evaluations of Indian LLMs, involving over 90,000 human assessments of 30 models in 10 languages to address linguistic diversity and cultural nuances, alongside enhancing model performance and reliability.\n\nThe AI startup scene in India is buzzing with activity, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nMukund Jha, the co-founder and former CTO of Dunzo, is in discussions to secure INR 80 crore (approximately $6-10 million) from Together Fund for his new generative AI startup focused on automating quality assurance processes in businesses, integrating AI and SaaS technologies.\n\nStartups appear to be acting on Peak XV Partners MD Rajan Anandan's words: \"Our firm has over INR 16,000 Cr of dry powder. We just want more people starting up in AI.\"\n\nAs per Traxcn data, in 2022, AI startups in India raised $599 million. However, funding dropped sharply to $168.4 million in 2023, representing a decline of almost 71%. In 2024, nearly $96 million has been raised so far, marking a 61% increase over the same period in 2023 but still an 82% decline compared to the first half of 2022.\n\nInterestingly, India ranks third among the top five countries by business funding, surpassing both the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nComing down to policies and guidelines, NITI Aayog introduced the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence in 2018, outlining guidelines for AI research and development across various sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, education, \"smart\" cities, infrastructure, and smart mobility.\n\nLater in 2021, NITI Aayog published Part 1 - Principles for Responsible AI and Part 2 - Operationalizing Principles for Responsible AI.\n\nRecently, the government enacted the Digital Personal Data Protection Act in 2023, which can be utilised to address privacy concerns related to AI platforms.\n\nIn its 2023 AI report, MeitY has outlined seven pillars for strategic AI development, including Centers of Excellence, Dataset Platform, and future skills initiatives.\n\nFurther, the report also has recommendations for how India can leverage its demographic dividend and play to its strengths as an IT superpower to further the penetration of AI skills in the country, strengthening the AI compute infrastructure in India to support AI innovation through public-private partnerships (PPPs).\n\nTo put it simply in the words of Paul Graham, the American computer scientist - \"If you start a startup now to do something that barely works with AI, the next models will make it really work.\"\n\nSeems like there's no stopping for India in AI.

It can solve complex problems and process huge amounts of data.\n\nBut the technology brings with it a host of environmental costs. Here, we weigh up the pros and cons.\n\n4 ways AI can help the natural world\n\nEnergy efficiency\n\nAI systems can control and optimise energy use. For example, AI-powered \"smart grids\" monitor and manage electricity generation to meet the demand of consumers, which can both lower energy costs and allow for more efficient energy use.\n\nAI can also help streamline the energy used by big commercial and industrial systems. Tech giant Google, for instance, used AI to cut the amount of energy required to cool its data centres by 40%.\n\nUrban Infrastructure\n\nWaste management systems driven by AI may help increase recycling rates. In the United Kingdom, for example, recycling company Recycleye uses AI to identify materials for sorting, lowering contamination rates and increasing recycling volumes - and so, reducing pressure on landfill.\n\nAnd AI-powered \"smart cities\" technologies help make public transport systems work more smoothly, which can reduce congestion and minimise vehicle emissions.\n\nArtificial intelligence can also be deployed to improve air quality in cities. IBM, for example, uses the technology to analyse weather and air pollution data from sensors and satellites. This can help authorities pinpoint pollution sources, make air quality forecasts and issue health alerts.\n\nSustainable agriculture\n\nAI-powered smart machines, robots and sensors are already used in agriculture.\n\nThey can provide real-time monitoring of weather, soil conditions and crop needs, leading to better water use and ensuring crops receive only what they need.\n\nThe technology can also identify pests, reducing the need to spray chemical pesticides on crops.\n\nAs climate change worsens, there are hopes AI can help farmers avoid reduced crop yields and become more resilient.\n\nEnvironmental monitoring\n\nAI systems can forecast floods, bushfires and other natural hazards quickly and accurately. This can minimise the effects of natural hazards on both the environment and communities.\n\nAI can be used to track environmental change. For example, it can reportedly measure changes in icebergs 10,000 times faster than a human can.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental group The Nature Conservancy uses AI to minimise the environmental impacts of hydropower across the Amazon.\n\nBut what about the downsides?\n\nThe path to realising the potential of AI is fraught - and the technology comes with several major downsides, as outlined below.\n\nEnergy use\n\nArtificial intelligence guzzles a huge amount of energy. First the computer models must be \"trained\", or fed a large set of data. This feeding can be relatively quick, or take up to several months - during which time big data processors are running 24/7.\n\nAnd when we ask AI to solve a problem, this also requires processing power which consumes energy. Advanced AI models such as ChatGPT reportedly use ten times more energy per search than a conventional Google search, according to one estimate. Only a small fraction of this demand is met by renewable energy sources.\n\nThe International Energy Agency projects electricity consumption from data centres, AI and cryptocurrency sector could double in the four years to 2026, from 460 terawatt-hours in 2022 to more than 1,000 terrawatt-hours in 2026.\n\nBy comparison, total electricity generation in Australia in 2022 was around 273 terawatt-hours.\n\nGreener AI systems are urgently needed - and this is looking increasingly possible. Studies have shown the energy use of AI-based computer models can be slashed through various means, such as reducing a model's complexity without affecting its performance.\n\nWater impacts\n\nThe water requirements of AI are significant. The data centres housing powerful AI servers generate a lot of heat. Water is used in cooling to keep the servers at operating temperature.\n\nAI also consumes water indirectly through its energy consumption. Coal-fired power stations use water for cooling, and water is also lost through evaporation from hydro electricity schemes.\n\nAnd as others have noted, the mining and manufacturing required to produce AI hardware both uses and pollutes water.\n\nBroader environmental damage\n\nThe environmental impact of AI goes beyond its energy use. For example, as Scientific American has reported, ExxonMobil in 2019 partnered with Microsoft to deploy AI in oil extraction, substantially increasing production.\n\nAs the article also noted, the use of AI in targeted online advertising - on platforms such as Instagram and Facebook - creates demand for material goods. This leads to greater consumption of mass-produced items which creates carbon emissions and uses Earth's natural resources.\n\nWhere to now?\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into modern life, its environmental footprint will grow. Humanity must find the right balance to ensure AI helps the Earth, rather than harms it.\n\nTo better achieve this, standard criteria must be developed to accurately measure the effects of AI on the environment.\n\nThere is also a push from some quarters for more environmental regulation of AI, and greater transparency from companies about their AI-related emissions.\n\nBut efforts to make AI more environmentally friendly will struggle for public and industry acceptance if the effectiveness of AI systems is sacrificed. To avoid this, stronger collaboration between researchers and the AI industry is needed.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [],

With an average of 13 mentions per earnings call per S&P 500 company, it's clear that executives across sectors are racing to harness this transformative technology. Early adopters are already gaining a competitive edge.\n\nWhile many organizations are still exploring AI's potential, industry pioneers like NVIDIA and JP Morgan are leading the charge. To understand how high-growth sectors like education, manufacturing, and retail are capitalizing on AI, let's examine their strategies and focus on digital transformation and talent acquisition.\n\nSurprisingly, the education sector is not only attracting top tech talent but also emerging as an AI powerhouse. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) are personalizing learning, reducing teacher workloads, and helping identify struggling students early. Georgia Tech's AI-powered virtual TA is a prime example of this innovation.\n\nAI is also reshaping admissions processes, streamlining reviews and potentially reducing bias. While concerns about AI making autonomous decisions exist, its role in enhancing efficiency and fairness is undeniable. EdTech leaders like Khan Academy and edX are integrating AI to create engaging learning experiences and accessible content.\n\nBy effectively leveraging AI, education companies can solidify their market positions and drive significant growth.\n\nLet's shift gears (pun intended) to manufacturing. This sector is embracing AI in a big way to optimize production lines, predict maintenance needs, and build digital twins -- a process that can save huge sums in research costs.\n\nEnvision machines that can sense when they're about to break down and alert maintenance before a problem arises, an AI-aided move to predictive maintenance which minimizes downtime and saves tons of money.\n\nAI is helping enhance hiring practices here the same way higher education is tapping into the tech to sort through applicants, sifting through resumes to find the best fit for highly technical roles and ensuring the right talent is brought on board efficiently.\n\nBack in 2019 (remember the pre ChatGPT days?), German automotive supplier Continental had deployed \"Industry 4.0,\" with a heavy investment in AI for product development and automatic replenishment to aid in supply chain efficiency.\n\nBeyond the factory floor, Continental has also teamed up with Google Cloud to integrate the tech giant's conversational AI technologies directly into Continental's smart cockpit HPC solution.\n\nLast year the company even set up an AI Lab in Berlin where experts from multiple corporate divisions collaborate on computer vision, integrating machine learning with conventional software programs and automated data labeling, working together to develop autonomous driving and robotics applications.\n\nRetail is another industry where AI is radically reshaping the landscape, where companies are leveraging AI to predict trends and manage inventories with incredible accuracy.\n\nGone are the days of overstocking or running out of popular items: with AI, retailers can anticipate what customers want before they even know it themselves.\n\nI'll give you an example: Walmart has integrated GenAI to help customers quickly find products and make confident purchase decisions, using an open-source, fine-tuned model with OpenAI. This helps the company generate personalized responses and product suggestions, truly understanding their customers at a deeper level.\n\nOff the store floor, Walmart has optimized its supply chain with AI-powered Route Optimization, reducing emissions and ensuring product availability. In another, equally impressive proactive move, the company is now offering this award-winning logistics technology to other businesses as a SaaS solution.\n\nIn all these sectors, AI isn't just a buzzword; it's a system that's driving big changes in infrastructure and smarter hiring.\n\nWhile it's exciting to see how these industries are starting to harness the power of AI to innovate and improve, I want to shift our focus onto two companies that are truly setting the high bar for what's possible.\n\nBeyond the meteoric rise in valuation, we've all be watching over the past months, NVIDIA is winning the AI race thanks to a combination of strategic investments, technological advancements, and a strong ecosystem.\n\nFirst, the company's GPUs (graphics processing units, which have become essential for AI processing) have become the industry standard for AI and machine learning workloads due to their high performance and efficiency in handling the parallel processing required for these tasks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform allows developers to optimize their applications to run on NVIDIA hardware; this has the benefit of cultivating a robust and loyal developer community.\n\nThe company has also invested heavily in AI-specific hardware, such as the Tensor Core technology found in their latest GPUs, which accelerates AI computations significantly. This hardware advantage is complemented by their software innovations, including frameworks like cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) and TensorRT, which optimize neural network performance.\n\nNVIDIA has also made the most of strategic acquisitions (the purchase of Mellanox Technologies is just one example) and the company has strengthened its position by enhancing their data center capabilities and improving the speed and efficiency of AI processing.\n\nTo top it all off, their partnerships with major cloud providers and integration with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch have cemented their dominance in the AI ecosystem.\n\nTo mix metaphors just a bit, NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders when it comes to AI, from market strategy to internal improvement, and I think I speak for all of us when I say we're all waiting to see what the tech giant does next.\n\nMoving from tech to banking, I've watched Jamie Dimon move JPMorgan Chase into a leading position in the race to deploy AI as the company integrates the technology across business functions, and commitment to innovation and talent acquisition.\n\nUnder Dimon's leadership, JPMorgan Chase has made significant investments in AI and machine learning, leveraging these technologies to optimize operations, enhance customer experiences, and drive business growth.\n\nHere's a leader who's not afraid to make a substantial investment in a cutting-edge technology: the bank spends billions annually on technology, with a significant portion dedicated to AI and machine learning.\n\nThis investment has enabled them to develop advanced AI capabilities that improve fraud detection, optimize trading strategies, and enhance risk management. By automating routine tasks and improving data analysis, they've increased efficiency and reduced costs, giving them a competitive edge.\n\nThe company's AI-powered COiN (Contract Intelligence) platform, which automates document review, has significantly sped up legal and compliance processes. In trading, they use machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and make more informed investment decisions.\n\nTaking a page from the retail playbook, AI is also employed in customer service through chatbots and personalized banking solutions, enhancing the overall customer experience.\n\nI think another critical factor is JPMorgan Chase's AI strategy is their focus on innovation and staying ahead of technological trends, establishing innovation labs and collaborating with fintech startups to explore new AI applications and ensure they remain at the forefront of technological advancements.\n\nA proactive approach like this gives them the confidence and the experience to quickly adapt to changes as they continue to leverage AI to their advantage in new ways.\n\nWe've seen how NVIDIA, JPMorgan Chase and others, having recognized the potential of AI early on, have pulled ahead in the race to master the technology, unlocking new efficiencies and competitive advantages along the way. For the rest of us, these AI leaders are like lighthouses, with their brilliant and bold adoption of AI offering a shining path forward. It's time to learn some lessons and pick up the pace.", "source": {"uri": "dice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dice Insights"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EdX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_maintenance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Predictive maintenance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CUDA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_transportation_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligent transportation system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Educational technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Product development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeled_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labeled data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellanox_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mellanox Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Dimon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.dice.com/binaries/large/content/gallery/dice/insights/2022/11/gettyimages-1055846738.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Here's how we know.", "body": "All of this has happened before, all of this will happen again. Credit: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhen you live in tech bubble central, signs of a tech bubble become easier to spot every time. Drive to Silicon Valley on any of the Bay Area's main arteries right now, and you'll notice nearly every billboard pumping a product \"driven by AI.\"\n\nOn the same drive five years ago, you'd see the same scene with the word \"blockchain.\" Ten years ago: \"big data.\" Twenty-five years ago: literally any word followed by \".com.\" Each one in turn, for all its promise, became a punchline.\n\nIt's not a question of whether the Silicon Valley machine was wrong on any of these technologies. Especially not the dotcom thing. Heck, the entire internet had just dropped into our laps in the 1990s; you can't blame anyone for dreaming about creating all the stuff we now take for granted. It's a question of impatience: all the investors, startup shysters and panicked CEOs that rush in when a promising new technology emerges are eager for immediate results.\n\nThen reality dawns, as it has evidently done for AI investors this summer. Amid a general stock market downturn Monday driven by the worst one-day crash the Japanese stock market has seen in decades, AI stocks like Nvidia -- which delayed its next-gen AI chips, and has reportedly been scraping \"a human lifetime\" of videos every day for an unreleased AI product despite internal concerns -- are taking a beating. Nvidia stock has lost a trillion dollars of valuation, 30% of the total, since its 2024 high.\n\nIf history is any guide, and it usually is, there's no coming back from a tipping point like this. The next part will be really painful for a lot of people -- and yet more beneficial for longterm tech progress than the bubble mentality could ever be.\n\nWhat accounts for the AI vibe shift?\n\nTake your pick. Maybe it was a study revealing that consumers are so turned off by the term \"AI,\" they are less likely to buy a product that uses it.\n\nMaybe it was Sam Altman and his weird unforced error with Scarlett Johansson, or Elon Musk trying to sell a flawed AI chatbot while pushing AI deepfakes.\n\nMaybe it was one of the largest and oldest hedge funds in the world telling clients that AI products are \"never going to be cost-efficient, never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\"\n\nOr maybe it was a Goldman Sachs report on generative AI titled \"Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?\" (That minces words just about as much as one of the best-titled academic papers of 2024, an inquiry into the growing phenomenon of AI hallucination: \"ChatGPT is bullshit.\")\n\nWhatever it was, the signs of panic are everywhere. Tech stocks are getting hammered no matter if they're planning to increase their expenditure -- Mark Zuckerberg announced $5 billion in \"aggressive\" new AI spending on his earnings call last week, then Meta stock dropped as much as 15% the next day -- or decrease it to make up for all their AI investments -- as was the case with Intel, where $10 billion in cost-cutting tanked the stock 25%.\n\n\"Generative AI itself won't disappear,\" wrote Gary Marcus, a noted AI skeptic, on his blog over the weekend. \"But investors may well stop forking out money at the rates they have, enthusiasm may diminish, and a lot of people may lose their shirts. Companies that are currently valued at billions of dollars may fold, or stripped for parts.\"\n\nMarcus had previously written that the crash would happen in 2025, but now believes it has arrived months ahead of schedule.\n\nRather than find revenue on their own, AI startups are suddenly keen to be gobbled up by one of the big fish. A chatbot maker called Character.AI, founded by a couple of AI enthusiasts who left Google because they were frustrated by the bureaucracy, just licensed its product to Google -- who will fold the founders and main researchers back into its bureaucracy. In recent weeks, Amazon ran the same acqui-hire playbook on an AI startup called Adept, while Microsoft did it to Inflection.\n\nCould it be any more clear that we've reached an inflection point?\n\nClearly, there is some promise in generative AI. It's just that much of that promise, as we've said before, lies in the small and boring business tasks: saving a bit of time on code development here, writing the first draft of a document there.\n\nThe vision of vast, exponential growth in AI tech, to the point where it is an imminent threat to humanity, should not trouble us much longer. Sam Altman's OpenAI has spent the last two years hyping up this threat; increasingly, Altman is seen as the boy who cried wolf. Large Language Models like ChatGPT have run out of stuff to train on, and the more they are trained on \"the internet,\" the more the internet contains a body of work written by AI -- degrading the product in question.\n\nOur excitement about AI art has also popped like a bubble. Everyone has access to the tools -- including your family members on Facebook -- therefore no AI art is special anymore. Indeed, we're more alert than ever to the shady theft and energy drain involved in making this stuff. AI-generated video is even worse on both counts, and has a harder problem leaving the uncanny valley.\n\nBack in Silicon Valley, what this means is that AI companies and products must have something special to survive the coming correction. Look at the startups that were still standing after the dotcom collapse in 2000 and you'll see some familiar names, like Google and Netflix.\n\nOnly if it happens slowly, over many years, without so much venture capital investment creating so much froth, will we finally arrive in the AI future today's startups can only dream about.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

When users first witness what AI is capable of, they are often in awe - and when they realize they can utilize this technology to accomplish far more than they were capable of previously, they sometimes become overly dependent on it. Bad idea; despite its advanced capabilities, AI still has some serious flaws.\n\nIn order to be truly effective, AI needs a human \"boss.\" In the human-AI partnership, it's the human who needs to come first - who needs to \"lead\" the AI system into providing results that make sense, by reviewing and applying experience and logic to the results provided by these amazing tools.\n\nFor example, AI can sometimes display \"tunnel vision,\" unaware of \"big picture\" policy issues and long-term corporate goals. It's sort of like a star employee who is very good at their job - but lacks knowledge or awareness of a company's long-term strategic goals. What you want from that employee is their productivity in their specific area - not an overhaul of the company based on their limited knowledge. Users need to treat AI systems as that \"talented employee\" - keeping in mind that they need to be in control of the overall project strategy. Just like a talented employee needs mentoring and guidance, so too AI. With that human guidance, companies can extract the greatest value from their new \"star performers;\" without it, the company could find itself in big trouble. And, when introducing new AI tools, which are increasingly employed to do jobs and tasks, they should be treated just like a new employee. This means that they need a boss to mentor and guide them, and supervise and check their work, at least in the beginning. And with AI, we are still at the beginning; and some micromanagement is often needed.\n\nThere's no question that AI tools have been a major boon to productivity - boosting output by nearly 500%, according to studies - and enabling businesses to become more agile, competitive, and efficient. And now that we've gotten used to employing them, doing business without these tools is inconceivable. As time goes on, AI tools will improve even more - and with them, the commensurate benefits in efficiency and profitability businesses will be able to extract from them. Indeed, for better or worse, business research today is often just posing a question to an AI tool.\n\nIt is true that humans are learning more about the nuances of this process all the time. For example, it is increasingly understood that by asking the right question, and using the right prompt, most AI tools will give you far better results than you could have gotten manually in such a short period of time. Automated AI systems will parse data in a matter of minutes, if not seconds - far faster than any human could hope to - and present it in a logical manner that is easily understood and comprehended. The temptation to take those results and run with them is, understandably, very strong.\n\nBut those automated results need to be understood, reviewed, and checked for accuracy. As smart as it is, AI sometimes comes up short. AI tools sometimes produce inaccurate, incorrect, or even illogical results - and without a human supervising the data generation process, companies could find themselves facing fines, lawsuits, and damaged reputations. Air Canada furnishes a good example of what can happen when AI runs unchecked: The company was recently ordered to pay damages to a passenger who paid full fare for tickets to a grandparent's funeral, based on incorrect information furnished by an AI-powered chatbot. The company's defense was that it could not be held responsible for incorrect information furnished by the chatbot - an argument rejected by the court, which ordered Air Canada to refund the overcharge. Had a human reviewed the information offered by the chatbot, the airline could have avoided the expense - and embarrassment - that ensued.\n\nBut it's not just about company coffers: Overreliance on automatically generated AI data can damage or even derail a career. In order to make an effective presentation - whether in person, in a presentation, or in a Zoom meeting - the presenter needs to be intimately familiar with the information they are presenting. This is difficult if the presenter is simply using information produced by AI. For example, if the automated data is incorrect, they are likely to be called out on it - with the audience or stakeholder demanding to know the source of data, the reasoning behind a statement, or the logic of an argument. And the presenter will likely not be able to answer in an effective and competent manner. A similar situation could arise even if the data is correct -- those listening to the presentation could very well start asking follow-up questions, or want to know the source or reasoning behind it.\n\nIn order to effectively - and safely - utilize their automated results, AI users need to engage in some \"active learning,\" where they evaluate the results and apply knowledge, facts, and experience to the review process. If the user follows that path, they could ask themselves the same questions likely to be posed to them - giving them time to find the answers they need. But ignoring that review could put them in jeopardy - making them look like fools when presenting information that on the surface appears to be correct, but might be riddled with flaws and or other factors that lead to questions.\n\nIt's a fact that more than half of Americans are concerned about AI's effects on their lives. Among other things, some fear losing their jobs to AI, some fear AI systems will compromise their privacy, some fear politicization of results. And it's understandable why people fear AI: It's been presented in the media as a monolithic, independent \"monster\" that is going to change life fundamentally, turning us all into its servants, if not destroy us. But that's not the case: AI is just the latest in advanced tools that we can use to make business, and life, easier and better. We don't work for AI - it works for us. AI users should keep this in mind when using advanced tools to do their business research. It's the human user who is in charge, who needs to lead - and the best way to do that is to utilize their experience and knowledge to ensure that the results AI tools provide are accurate, correct, and logical.", "source": {"uri": "aithority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AiThority"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micromanagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monolithic system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indie game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://aithority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JULY_stockimages-43-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Industry leaders are rapidly recognizing the potential of AI to revolutionize various aspects of banking, lending, and financial services. Global technology leader Google has outlined a three-pronged approach for financial institutions to harness AI's power:\n\nDeveloping a well-defined strategy for AI adoption is crucial for financial institutions to maintain a competitive edge. Google's assessment framework provides a valuable tool for evaluating an organization's progress in implementing AI-powered marketing solutions. By aligning AI initiatives with specific business goals, financial institutions can ensure that AI investments yield maximum returns. This approach is vital for creating a clear AI roadmap that guides institutions toward effective and strategic AI integration.\n\nAI-driven marketing tools can significantly enhance customer attraction and retention for financial institutions. Google's Demand Gen tool enables businesses to tailor content to resonate with consumers throughout their journey, while App Campaigns for engagement leverage generative AI to create compelling ads that re-engage lapsed customers. Local banks like Security Bank and Unionbank have achieved impressive results using Google's AI tools, generating more leads and improving conversion rates. These AI-powered marketing strategies are pivotal for driving growth and sustaining customer relationships.\n\nWhile AI offers immense potential, human expertise remains essential for optimal results. Training employees to leverage AI tools effectively is crucial. Google's AI Essentials online course equips individuals with fundamental AI skills, empowering them to enhance productivity and drive innovation. By fostering a culture of continuous learning, financial institutions can attract and retain top talent in the digital age. Investing in AI skills training ensures that employees can harness the full potential of AI technologies, leading to more innovative and efficient operations.\n\n\"We advise organizations on how to model the right behavior from a leadership standpoint and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow their employees and staff to upskill. In today's rapidly evolving financial landscape, AI adoption isn't merely a competitive advantage, it's a necessity. By embracing AI tools and innovation, local financial institutions can be well-positioned to win customers and achieve long-term growth,\" according to Jackie Wang, Google Country Director for the Philippines and Thailand during a press briefing held at the Google Philippines headquarters in BGC this week.\n\nGoogle Gemini is attracting significant attention in the business world as early adopters explore its potential to enhance operations. Positioned as an advanced AI platform designed to integrate with existing systems, Gemini offers tools for improved data analysis, automation, and personalized customer experiences. Some organizations are already utilizing Gemini's sophisticated algorithms to uncover deeper consumer insights, refine marketing tactics, and streamline processes. As the technology matures, its ability to drive substantial business growth and innovation will become clearer. These early applications demonstrate the increasing role of AI in modern business, with the potential to transform industries and customer interactions.\n\nCombating fraud and scams, a growing concern in the Philippines and worldwide is greatly enhanced by AI. Google's sophisticated AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, complementing human efforts to protect consumers. The company actively participates in initiatives like the global anti-scam alliance to share information and counter evolving threats. This capability is crucial for maintaining trust and security within the financial system.\n\nAI is poised to revolutionize the financial landscape in the Philippines. By developing clear AI roadmaps, leveraging AI-powered marketing tools, and investing in AI skills training, financial institutions can unlock growth opportunities and enhance customer experiences. The capability to combat fraud and scams is crucial for building trust and ensuring the integrity of the financial system.

However, it is important to note that before the EU AI Act, AI was not unregulated in the EU. The world of AI isn't the Wild West.\n\nPrevious enforcement actions under GDPR include the Italian Data Protection Authority's ban on the ReplikaAI chatbot, Google's temporary suspension of its Bard AI tool rollout after Irish data watchdog intervention, Italian DPA fines for Deliveroo over AI algorithm use, and Clearview AI fines under GDPR, including from the Italian, French & Greek DPAs.\"\n\n\"Preparation now is key. Organisations should assess their current use and planned use of AI systems. Conduct a compliance gap analysis and identify affected business areas.\"\n\n\"Building a bespoke Action Plan is essential. This includes training employees, raising awareness, and briefing boards on AI risks and opportunities. Board training is especially important - many boards just don't have AI and technology skills on their current board. They'll need to fix this to understand the risks and opportunities with AI. Opting out of AI isn't an option either. Knowledge will be important.\"\n\n\"Organisations need to take an inventory of their current AI systems to identify what AI systems are being used and their risk level. Additionally, drafting and amending internal policies and procedures on AI compliance, such as updating data breach plans to include EU AI Act reporting, is essential.\"\n\n\"Preparing materials and notices to inform your customers of your AI use to meet transparency and other legal obligations, creating templates for required documents under the EU AI Act, and suggesting standardised clauses or addendums to add to your client and supplier agreements are also recommended steps. Legal advice is recommended to ensure all steps are covered.\"\n\n\"The UK government's position on AI regulation has evolved, with the Labour Government's recent King's Speech indicating plans for new AI legislation. This includes setting up a Regulatory Innovation Office to support existing regulators. The new law might be a simplified version of the EU AI Act.\n\nAlso, we shouldn't expect the UK Government to wait and see what happens with EU enforcement when the EU AI Act comes fully into force. With capable people in government who understand AI, a willingness to regulate, and a healthy majority to get things done, the new government might move more quickly.\"\n\nFor more information or to arrange an interview please contact me.", "source": {"uri": "onrec.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Online recruitment magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordham_University_School_of_Law", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fordham University School of Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LexisNexis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LexisNexis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Postgraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearview_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clearview AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliveroo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deliveroo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Presse-Agentur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Presse-Agentur"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

With great power, though, comes great responsibility. Policymakers, alongside those in civil society and industry, are looking to governance that minimizes potential harm and shapes a safe, human-centered AI-empowered society. I applaud some of these efforts yet caution against others; California's Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, better known as SB-1047, falls into the latter category. This well-meaning piece of legislation will have significant unintended consequences, not just for California, but for the entire country.\n\nAI policy must encourage innovation, set appropriate restrictions, and mitigate the implications of those restrictions. Policy that doesn't will at best fall short of its goals, and at worst lead to dire, if unintended, consequences.\n\nIf passed into law, SB-1047 will harm our budding AI ecosystem, especially the parts of it that are already at a disadvantage to today's tech giants: the public sector, academia, and \"little tech.\" SB-1047 will unnecessarily penalize developers, stifle our open-source community, and hamstring academic AI research, all while failing to address the very real issues it was authored to solve.\n\nFirst, SB-1047 will unduly punish developers and stifle innovation. In the event of misuse of an AI model, SB-1047 holds liable the party responsible and the original developer of that model. It is impossible for each AI developer -- particularly budding coders and entrepreneurs -- to predict every possible use of their model. SB-1047 will force developers to pull back and act defensively -- precisely what we're trying to avoid.\n\nSecond, SB-1047 will shackle open-source development. SB-1047 mandates that all models over a certain threshold include a \"kill switch,\" a mechanism by which the program can be shut down at any time. If developers are concerned that the programs they download and build on will be deleted, they will be much more hesitant to write code and collaborate. This kill switch will devastate the open-source community -- the source of countless innovations, not just in AI, but across sectors, ranging from GPS to MRIs to the internet itself.\n\nThird, SB-1047 will cripple public sector and academic AI research. Open-source development is important in the private sector, but vital to academia, which cannot advance without collaboration and access to model data. Take computer science students, who study open-weight AI models. How will we train the next generation of AI leaders if our institutions don't have access to the proper models and data? A kill switch would even further dampen the efforts of these students and researchers, already at such a data and computation disadvantage compared to Big Tech. SB-1047 will deal a death knell to academic AI when we should be doubling down on public-sector AI investment.\n\nMost alarmingly, this bill does not address the potential harms of AI advancement, including bias and deepfakes. Instead, SB-1047 sets an arbitrary threshold, regulating models that use a certain amount of computing power or cost $100 million to train. Far from providing a safeguard, this measure will merely restrict innovation across sectors, including academia. Today, academic AI models fall beneath this threshold, but if we were to rebalance investment in private and public sector AI, academia would fall under SB-1047's regulation. Our AI ecosystem will be worse for it.\n\nWe must take the opposite approach. In various conversations with President Biden over the past year, I have expressed the need for a \"moonshot mentality\" to spur our country's AI education, research, and development. SB-1047, however, is overly and arbitrarily restrictive, and will not only chill California's AI ecosystem but will also have troubling downstream implications for AI across the nation.\n\nI am not anti-AI governance. Legislation is critical to the safe and effective advancement of AI. But AI policy must empower open-source development, put forward uniform and well-reasoned rules, and build consumer confidence. SB-1047 falls short of those standards. I extend an offer of collaboration to Senator Scott Wiener, the bill's author: Let us work together to craft AI legislation that will truly build the technology-enabled, human-centered society of tomorrow. Indeed, the future of AI depends on it.

Tasks like data analysis, transcription, customer support, and everything in between can be performed using AI to reduce time to results by orders of magnitude. Financial planning is no exception.\n\nAccording to the US International Trade Administration, the AI market in India is projected to reach $8 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of over 40% from 2020 to 2025. According to a survey from F2 Strategy, more than half of wealth management firms have an AI project underway already. They're interested in predictive analytics on market conditions and securities changes over time, optical character recognition to analyze documents, workflow automation, chatbots, and more. According to a report, nearly 75,000 financial phishing attempts targeting Indian financial companies were detected last year, with 25% of them happening due to human error. The potential is clear - AI can reduce the human time spent on these tasks by as much as 90%. At the same time, more than 60% of firms say they need more education on AI. So while the upside is undeniable, the value to risk ratio is less clear.\n\nThis dynamic is particularly important for financial planning, where the stakes are higher - families' and individuals' money is directly at risk. While bespoke wealth management services typically cater to higher-net worth individuals, AI makes it possible to offer these services to a broader group of people. Advisors can develop customer profiles and deliver personalized plans based on age, assets, risks, goals, and needs in a fraction of the time, which means firms can offer it to more people. This represents a new market for wealth managers, but also a larger risk pool.\n\nWe must always remember that threat actors are using AI too. It offers attackers the same exact benefits - it's a force multiplier that allows them to increase the scale and effectiveness of their campaigns. They can even poison the AI model itself to reveal sensitive information or deliver malicious results. Moreover, employees who are not adequately trained can inadvertently expose sensitive information through the information they input into AI tools, which subsequently incorporate it into their machine learning activities. We've already seen instances of this invalidating intellectual property claims.\n\nSecurity controls therefore have to be integrated into the entire AI lifecycle, including employee training. Before using any AI tool, organizations must understand the privacy classification of all the data that might be input, the source of the data used to train the AI tools, and the specifics of the security protocols in place to protect sensitive information. This must be part of the AI rollout from day one. Open AI systems carry even more risk, as they're designed to be accessible to the public, which enables them to learn from a much larger dataset, but also allows manipulation by bad actors. Closed systems are more secure, but require more hands-on management and model training. Employees should be given in-depth training about the tool and how it works, and how to use it safely - emphasizing which data can be used and which should never be exposed to a large language model (LLM) like the kind that power generative AI applications. However cyberattacks continues to dominate all markets with Indian organisations, on average, were targeted 2,924 times per week over the past six months, compared to 1,401 attacks per organisation globally. Last year, India featured amongst the top three most targeted APAC countries as the use of AI and ransomware increased the sophistication and speed of attacks. The AI adoption rate in key Indian industries reached approximately 48% in FY2024 indicating a strong trend toward incorporating AI technologies into business operations\n\nWhen implementing an AI-based solution, it's important to identify the scope of the tool and restrict its data access to what's absolutely necessary to train it. Develop a comprehensive understanding of the privacy of the information, the source of the model's data, and the native security mechanisms built in. Many AI-tools have built-in defenses to protect against unethical use - a good example are ChatGPT's rules that seek to prevent people from using it for nefarious purposes, like building malware. However, it's clear also that these rules can be bypassed through cleverly worded prompts that obscure the intent of the user. This is one type of prompt injection attack, which is a category of threats unique to AI-based systems. Strong controls must be in place to prevent these attacks before they happen. Broadly, these controls fall under the scope of zero trust cybersecurity strategies.\n\nAI tools, especially the LLMs that enable generative AI, should not be treated as a typical software tool. They are more like a hybrid between a tool and a user. Zero trust programs limit access to resources based on a person's individual job function, scope, and needs. This limits the damage an attacker can do by compromising a single employee, because it limits the range of lateral movement. We have to remember that adding any software tool also increases the attack surface by offering more entry points to an attacker. Compromising a tool - like an AI tool - that has unlimited access to personally identifiable information, company secrets, proprietary tools, strategic forecasting, competitive analysis, and more could be catastrophic. Preventing this kind of a breach must be at the forefront of the strategy-level discussion to implement AI tools from the very beginning. After a cyber security incident, it's often too late.\n\nWhile most AI tools come with built-in security, organizations must take care to tailor these to their specific needs. They must also go beyond them. Despite similarities, each organization will have unique use cases, and calibrating defense to match these dynamics is table stakes for cybersecurity in 2024. The cost of cybercrime reached $8 trillion in 2023, according to a report from Cybersecurity Ventures. Clearly, this isn't a niche threat. It can reasonably be considered among the primary threats every business faces today, and proactive security is therefore a foundation for doing business at all.\n\nWhen we talk about AI, security is even more important. AI won't replace financial advisors, but it will take the industry to its next stage of evolution, and that means new threats. The scale of the models and the data they ingest expand the attack surface exponentially, and just one breach can negate any and all gains a company makes leveraging AI. Cyber security analysis and control, under a zero trust model, is indispensable for unlocking the full potential of any AI-based tool.", "source": {"uri": "apnnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "apnnews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wealth management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Point", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Check Point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(linguistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transcription (linguistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Optical character recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Order of magnitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Predictive analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Threat actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.apnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sundar-Balasubramanian-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

It's affecting people at home and where they work. Is this the rise of the machines, or just a way to be more productive and increase output? Mark Furman, CEO of Evalu8r, believes it's the latter. We spoke to him about the role that artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to play in automatic identification (auto ID) technologies.\n\nBar coding, labelling, scanning and RFID solution purveyor Kemtek says it's already seeing the impact of AI in the marketplace, and is excited to see its customers benefiting from these advancements. Mags Govender, Kemtek's Head of Strategic Marketing, says: \"The use of AI in auto ID solutions is enabling more accurate identification, real-time tracking, enhanced analytics and automation for our customers.\"\n\nAI is when machines are programmed to mimic humans. It's great for repetitive tasks and is highly scalable, making it ideal for routine actions such as call centres, data entry or automatic identification. AI's ability to understand, see, hear, speak and move makes it a versatile technology for various applications. It's also able to take data, analyse it and learn from it, becoming smarter over time.\n\nFurman says: \"Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful technology, able to simulate human intelligence. It empowers businesses by enabling personalised customer experiences, optimising processes, predicting trends, automating tasks and providing valuable insights. By leveraging AI, businesses can achieve increased efficiency, smarter decision-making and drive growth and innovation.\"\n\nHe cautions that companies that don't have the expertise to deploy AI might find themselves left behind in the fourth industrial revolution.\n\nIn the context of auto ID technologies, such as bar coding and RFID, AI plays a crucial role in enhancing accuracy and efficiency, and improving decision-making processes. It offers numerous advantages and opportunities for businesses, including:\n\nAI has considerably impacted industries where auto ID is critical, such as logistics, retail/e-commerce, warehousing, agriculture, education and healthcare. In each of these industries, AI combined with auto ID plays a key role in optimising operations, enhancing efficiency and improving decision-making.\n\nFurman says: \"AI is able to save businesses both time and money. These types of efficiencies are something that businesses are hoping to achieve anyway. A common argument against the use of AI is a lack of budget, but AI tools are generally much cheaper than traditional software. In some instances, they may even replace some traditional software.\"\n\nNo article on AI would be complete without examining the benefits for the reseller itself. Furman says businesses such as Kemtek can benefit from AI in myriad ways.\n\nFirst and foremost, AI can assist the business to manage its inventory better. \"AI-powered analytics can optimise inventory levels, automate replenishment processes and improve demand forecasting, reducing costs and improving stock management.\"\n\nThe customer experience will also improve. \"AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants can provide instant support and personalised assistance to customers, improving response times and overall CX. AI algorithms can analyse customer data to generate targeted product recommendations, increasing cross-selling and upselling opportunities.\"\n\nAI is also able to streamline order processing, reducing errors, improving accuracy and speeding up order fulfilment, meaning that customers get the right order, quickly.\n\nWhen it comes to predictive maintenance, AI analytics based on auto ID data help detect anomalies and predict maintenance needs, allowing for proactive service and reducing downtime.\n\nFinally, AI-powered data analysis provides valuable insights into market trends, customer preferences and competitor analysis, assisting with strategic decision-making and enabling the business to identify new opportunities.\n\nLooking ahead, Furman believes AI will continue to play a crucial role in business strategy, decision-making and innovation. \"It will enable personalisation at scale and automate routine tasks. I predict strengthened collaboration between humans and AI, while ethical AI development and responsible usage will also gain focus, ensuring transparency, fairness and accountability.", "source": {"uri": "itweb.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITWeb"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alison_job@itweb.co.za", "name": "Alison Job", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Furman University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Radio-frequency identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Call centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Process_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Process Analysis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2024/08/Mark-Furman-06Aug2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This blueprint is crucial for countries to harness AI's potential and direct its influence towards socio-economic growth.\n\nNations typically adopt one of three strategic archetypes: the 'National Enabler', which focuses on broad socio-economic development through AI; the 'Specialist', which leverages AI in sectors where a country holds expertise or competitive advantages; and the 'Global Leader', aiming for comprehensive leadership in AI.\n\nThese archetypes guide the strategic allocation of resources and investment in AI, ensuring that national strategies are about technological advancement, societal progress, and economic prosperity.\n\nAs such, aligning national AI strategies with one of these archetypes allows countries to navigate the AI landscape with a clear vision, fostering innovation and ensuring that AI development is in harmony with national goals and societal needs. As we delve deeper into the complexities of such a strategy, the ASPIRE framework serves as a guide.\n\nCrafting a national AI strategy\n\nNations are navigating new terrains in the vast expanse of AI. To aid this journey, the ASPIRE framework emerges, offering a meticulously crafted blueprint for effective national AI strategies. This BCG-proposed framework distills six pivotal elements: ambition, skills, policy and regulation, investment, research and innovation, and ecosystem.\n\nAmbition is the driver of a national AI strategy. Nations must make informed decisions about their priorities, ensuring they align with an overarching archetype that fosters economic development and private sector enablement. This strategy involves more than choosing between extremes on a spectrum; it necessitates a nuanced calibration of significant investments and the effective allocation of resources to stimulate economic growth and private sector innovation.\n\nSkills emphasize the pivotal role of human capital in this AI-driven era. It is not just about machines; it's fundamentally about people, their capabilities, and adaptability. To attract and retain talent, nations must prioritize fostering a broad base of AI literacy among citizens and simultaneously nurture a specialized cadre of AI experts.\n\nWith AI potentially revolutionizing specific job roles, reskilling becomes essential.\n\nPolicy and regulation grow in significance with AI's spread. Initial endeavors leaned towards minimalistic ethical boundaries. However, refining and updating relevant legislation becomes essential as AI's influence deepens in various aspects of life. These regulations manage the risks associated with AI's broad implications.\n\nInvestment powers AI's trajectory. Beyond allocating funds for research and development, it is about shaping the financial mechanisms that support the AI ecosystem's growth. Nations should promote local and international investments, facilitating business support mechanisms and offering incentives.\n\nResearch and Innovation signify AI's continuous evolution. With the ever-changing field, nations must remain at the forefront, contributing to and drawing from global AI insights, encompassing foundational and applied research. It emphasizes developing and innovating AI solutions that align with the nation's priority sectors, challenges, and opportunities.\n\nBy aligning AI research with these strategic points, nations can foster growth in areas that matter most to them.\n\nEcosystems are about crafting a robust infrastructure and fostering a vibrant AI community. AI's potential magnifies when academia, industry, and policymakers come together. Nations should bolster this synergy with tools, AI platforms, and data access, nurturing local startups and established entities.\n\nInternational collaborations introduce diverse expertise, placing the nation at the heart of the global AI dialogue.\n\nFrom blueprint to reality\n\nTransforming AI visions into tangible impacts requires solid governance and collaboration across public and private sectors. For instance, Saudi Arabia's strategy is led by a dedicated entity - the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA), which drives a holistic national governance for Data & AI and collaboration across the ecosystem towards enabling the country's Vision 2030.\n\nSuch an example underscores the critical role of a well-structured approach in operationalizing AI strategies, ensuring they align with national objectives and foster economic growth.\n\nThe journey from blueprint to implementation emphasizes creating a vision and executing a holistic strategy that includes robust governance and engages local and global communities. The ASPIRE framework offers a structured path forward, advocating for a comprehensive strategy that leverages AI for societal and economic betterment.\n\nDr. Akram Awad\n\nThe writer is a Partner at BCG.\n\nDr. Lars Littig\n\nThe writer is Managing Director and Partner.\n\nFrank Felden\n\nThe writer is Managing Director & Senior Partner.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Resource allocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Consulting_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Consulting Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applied science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_and_Society", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business and Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2024/06/25/Stock-Artificial-Intelligence_1904e2fe2a7_medium.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

S&P Global and Accenture plan to develop new AI benchmarks and tools for the entire financial services industry. It's a savvy move that could make S&P Global the go-to source for AI-powered financial analysis.\n\nS&P Global has already begun this transformation. Its internal \"Spark Assist\" platform and customer-facing Chat AI are early examples of how the company sees AI augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it.\n\n\"We've built vibrant communities... engaging and telling us what's working well, and what's not,\" Dayalji explained. \"They're sharing with us things like, 'Wow, I've been able to generate an application that does specific data extraction tasks, that improves how quickly I can complete that task.' So you can measure the time to market part really easily. Where ordinarily a person would tell you, 'Hey, I would take like two weeks to do something like this,' now I can do it in a matter of a day.\"\n\nThe potential impact of this AI push is significant. Some employees report time savings of up to 50% on certain tasks. But the true value, according to Dayalji, lies in freeing up experts to focus on higher-value work.\n\n\"My view has always been that AI is for all, and what I really wanted to do is create opportunities for our people to do higher-value work, that differentiated work,\" he said. \"We have domain experts here with decades of knowledge in specific industries like financial services and oil and gas markets. The aim for me is: I don't want them to do the mundane work.\"\n\nThis move comes at a critical time for S&P Global. As tech giants like Microsoft and Google race to integrate AI into their products, financial data providers can't afford to be left behind. S&P Global is betting that its vast troves of proprietary financial data, combined with advanced AI capabilities, will give it a unique advantage.\n\n\"We're integral to this part of the shift that's happening,\" Dayalji said. \"We're building these generative AI applications and leveraging our data. So we're kind of sticky and part of that workflow.\"\n\nHowever, challenges remain. The rapid pace of AI development, concerns about data privacy, and the need for model accuracy in high-stakes financial decisions are all hurdles that S&P Global will need to navigate.\n\nThere's also the question of how to measure success. While some productivity gains are immediately apparent, Dayalji acknowledges that the true impact may take time to manifest on the balance sheet.\n\n\"In the coming years, we're going to have to start seeing it kind of show up in our balance sheets,\" he said. \"How does it change the composition of our teams? What do they work on?\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Dayalji remains optimistic about the transformative potential of generative AI. \"This shift is coming,\" he insisted. \"I think that there's a slight impatience that it should be here already. And I think like any technology shift, it might take longer than you think. But then when it really starts picking up steam, it's going to happen really quickly.\"\n\nThe implications of this initiative extend far beyond S&P Global. As one of the largest providers of financial data and analytics, the company's embrace of AI could accelerate adoption across the financial services industry. Competitors, clients, and regulators will all be watching closely to see how this ambitious bet plays out.\n\nIn the end, S&P Global's AI push is not just about improving its own operations. It's about reshaping how the entire financial industry operates in an AI-driven future. As Dayalji put it, \"I think what we really need to be thinking about is, how is our lives going to change? And how do we want AI to play a role in making our lives better both society at large, but also in our companies?\"\n\nWith its all-in AI strategy, S&P Global isn't just betting on the future of finance -- it's aiming to be the house that always wins.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureBeat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "VentureBeat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SP-Global-partners-with-Accenture-launches-massive-AI-training-program.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

A new paper in the journal Diagnostic and Interventional Imaging discusses the steps necessary to ensure AI in healthcare is used responsibly and sustainably.\n\nStudy: Climate change and artificial intelligence in healthcare: Review and recommendations towards a sustainable future. Image Credit: metamorworks / Shutterstock\n\nBackground\n\nAI has been incorporated into healthcare devices, mostly in diagnostic imaging, radiation therapy, interventional radiology, and nuclear medicine. Deep learning (DL) is the most frequently used AI application in such devices. DL allows models to learn from data without the operator's involvement and thus can improve diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes and increase care efficiency.\n\nHowever, this computationally heavy platform comes with a high carbon footprint, which may accelerate climate change and negatively impact the environment in multiple ways.\n\nClimate change is an urgent issue, and the need to mitigate its effects and slow its rate of progression has been recognized internationally. The current review assessed the use of AI in healthcare in the context of climate change.\n\nThe pros of AI for healthcare and climate change\n\nThe positives of AI in healthcare include a much smoother, faster, and less wasteful workflow and the ability to use telemedicine more widely. AI can reduce the waste of resources such as energy, time, and imaging materials by improving the identification of patients requiring imaging and reducing wait times.\n\nAI can also enhance the clinician's diagnostic capabilities, thus avoiding the need for repeat examinations. When coupled with a sleeker workflow, this can help promote virtual care and reduce unnecessary patient travel, bringing down greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe energy cost of AI in healthcare\n\nThe training and utilization of AI models are energy-intensive. Healthcare applications account for over 4% of AI use at present, and they require large datasets, complex algorithms, and multiple model updates. One study reported that a single large AI model takes as much energy to run as five cars over their entire lifespan.\n\nThe use of AI in healthcare depends on data centers that use servers, cooling systems, and networking platforms. All these must run constantly in controlled environments, consuming a lot of energy and accounting for about 1% of global power consumption.\n\nHealthcare also produces large amounts of electronic waste due to the constant need for hardware updates. Such waste can poison the environment due to the use of materials such as lead, cadmium, and mercury.\n\nThe high demand for natural resources like rare earth elements takes a toll on biodiversity by promoting habitat destruction. Transportation and AI-associated supply chain logistical demands intensify the indirect impact of healthcare-linked AI on the environment.\n\nMitigation measures\n\nPossible solutions could include increasing the energy efficiency of AI models via techniques like quantization and pruning. Improved infrastructure design, revamping hardware and software concepts, and efficient power management using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling can also reduce AI's environmental costs.\n\nIncorporating renewable energy can reduce AI-associated energy consumption. In fact, AI-aided nuclear fusion reactor design could make progress in harnessing this power source for AI in healthcare.\n\nSuch steps require a comprehensive lifecycle evaluation for environmental cost, enabling scientists to seize opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint from beginning to end. One study reported that \"autonomous AI could potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in healthcare by up to 80%\".\n\nCooperation of stakeholders is key\n\nSustainability practices for AI in healthcare will only be successful if policies and government initiatives are strengthened. This requires collaborating with stakeholders at all stages of the process.\n\nRegional and international cooperation is essential for these trends to become the norm, and the sharing of knowledge is essential.\n\nBest practices for sustainable AI in healthcare include designing green frameworks, AI system lifecycle assessment, the responsible use of data, and regulatory oversight of changes and movements in the field. By understanding the current state of knowledge, this review of AI in healthcare and its impact on climate change aims to direct future research and target areas where better practices are required.\n\nPrioritizing sustainability and environmental responsibility is crucial to ensure that the benefits of AI are realized while actively contributing to the preservation of our planet.\n\nJournal reference: Ueda, D., Walston, S.

Here's What To Do About It.", "body": "According to McKinsey, 15% of the global workforce, or 400 million workers, might lose their job to AI by 2030. Google's research is more positive, finding that 31% of jobs would be insulated from AI and 61% radically transformed by it.\n\nEmployers disagree. Every week there are AI conferences, meetups and webinars designed to help entrepreneurs leverage AI in their company. Founders want to make more impact, more money, with less hassle. And hassle means people.\n\nThe writing is on the wall. Employers are excited about AI. They are excited about growing their revenue without increasing headcount, which is now very possible with clever use of technology. Headcount used to be a measure of success for a company owner. A badge of honor. Now, the entrepreneur heroes are those that make more revenue per person than all the others. Growing your company by adding people isn't aspirational.\n\nThe almost two-thirds of British jobs that could be \"enhanced\" with AI, from Google's research, is a stat that hides the real truth. It's not going to happen on its own. Your job will only be enhanced by AI if you make it so. Otherwise, it's going to be replaced. The people within your organization who are leading the charge on AI processes will make sure of that.\n\nSo what's the solution? Lead the charge yourself. If business owners are looking to make more money and impact with the same number or even fewer people, help them to do it. Entrepreneurs are crying out for employee-led initiatives; someone within their team being resourceful, forward-thinking, and making a plan for how the company can leverage AI. It's those team members that will be the safest of all.\n\nIn 2020, Covid-19 disrupted the world in a short space of time. The AI revolution is multiples more transformative, but employees are still asleep. If your employer is looking to replace you, become irreplaceable. Here's how.\n\nArtificial intelligence is not a new concept by any means, but generative AI leapt to popularity with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. This friendly chat interface sparked the imagination of business owners and their teams. They were apprehensive, some terrified of being fooled (by AI-generated content) and replaced, but since then many have become resourceful and applied the technology in various ways.\n\nEmployees have been the driving force behind the transformation of some companies. Here are two examples:\n\nOne US-based investment company acquires software companies before rapidly growing them to generate inflated returns for its backers. The M&A team was booked in back-to-back meetings with potential acquisitions. Enter AI. One entrepreneurial team member analyzed the company's most successful investments to uncover the defining factors of the companies and owners. He created a survey to screen companies and founders against those factors, then used AI to analyze the results of submissions.\n\nThe result? Fewer meetings booked, fewer M&A team members needed. Higher quality of meetings with higher chance of investment success. More impact, less time, fewer people. Now, they run ads to the survey itself, to expand their company with this effective method. The employee leading the campaign is a company hero.\n\nExamples like this are becoming more common. One UK-based software company generates website traffic with search engine optimization tactics. Its owner hired a content writer to create articles to rank, with a specific output goal based on articles per week. But this content writer was resourceful beyond her job description. She tested the theory that by learning effective prompting, using Claude, she could multiply her article production by a factor of ten, without compromising quality.\n\nThe result? More output, less need to hire more writers. Company grows by search engine traffic alone. This employee made herself irreplaceable. This person is a founder's dream.\n\nIf you're employed in a company, the choice is yours. Wait for AI to take your job, wait for AI to \"enhance\" your job, or do something about it now. This isn't about robots; this is about human potential. AI is a tool. See what you're capable of and see what success you can create from your contracted hours. I promise you, it's more than you think.\n\nHere's the PLEASE framework that I created to help structure how you transform your role and company with AI. It stands for: perspective, learn, experiment, ask, share and finally explore. Let's get ambitious.\n\nStart by truly understanding what your company is there to do. On a fundamental level, what problem is it solving, and for which specific group of people? Write out your company's mission statement at its most basic level in the format \"We help [specific person] do [desirable outcome you create].\"\n\nYour job is to apply artificial intelligence to make that happen on a bigger scale. Not restricted by current limits. More profitably, more efficiently, in a more powerful way, with you leading the charge. Don't take your eyes off the reason this matters. AI is your ticket to making more impact, not something to be afraid of.\n\nThe next step is to learn. Learn what's out there. Learn how to prompt. Understand what AI can and can't do, and grasp the benefits and limitations of relevant tools. Don't confuse AI for automation, don't think you need a complicated solution where a simple spreadsheet would suffice. Learning about AI is free. Newsletters, resources and courses all exist to help you out.\n\nWhen you're clued up, write down every process your role involves, from start to finish. Think about the optimal way each task could be done, and label it accordingly. Don't delegate your superpowers. Your goal here is to identify quick wins for AI-ification, not outsource your genius and then coast.\n\nThe next step is to conduct experiments, using this list, about which tasks could be eliminated, automated or AI-ified. Identify the bottleneck. Imagine your company had ten times the demand, which steps would soon break? Within the experiment phase, you apply AI to specific tasks and processes to free them from human constraints, including yourself.\n\nThis sounds complicated and costly, but it's actually not. There's more than one LLM. Most AI tools have free trials. You can book a consultation with an AI or automation expert on Fiverr, for a low relative cost. Track your time when using the tools, assess what they save, scrutinize the output and start to draw conclusions. This is your playground.\n\nDepending on the structure of your organization, the \"ask\" can come at a different stage. Are you trusted enough to run experiments, or will your employer want a say from the start?\n\nIf you need permission to get started, present your case after doing your research. If you already ran the experiments, ask if you can implement them. If you already tested out the tools, ask if you can continue beyond the trial. Ideally, figure everything out for yourself before you have to get someone else involved. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Move quickly and of your own accord, before the out-of-touch board gets a chance to slow you down.\n\nDon't let this stage cost your progress. You have the company's best interests in mind, you know the priorities and your KPIs. You are simply doing your research on how AI can ensure you hit them. Your duty of care is solid. Self-learning, experimentation, ideation and commonsensical conclusions will help you present your case.\n\nWhen you have got perspective, learned about AI, experimented with solutions and got the required permission, present your findings and get everyone excited. Explain what you have found, share the details of what specific tools or interventions could achieve, and make recommendations for who does what going forward. Prepare well so you can deliver with confidence.\n\nFocus on output, expansion, and impact, because that's what your employer really cares about. The more you can be commercially aware and specific about the next steps, the more you will be credited for transforming your organization from the inside-out. Don't underestimate the importance of this step. Aim to get buy-in from your seniors and colleagues. Aim to get momentum, then decide a future checkpoint for measuring progress. Own every part of this maneuver.\n\nIn the dream scenario, your research pays off and your experiments were worthwhile. You get team-wide buy in and everyone knows what they are here to do. You'll have demonstrated your resourcefulness, proven yourself one of the most valuable team members, and opened up options for where you go from here.\n\nNot only will you be getting stuck into a new challenge, you'll be earning the company more revenue or saving costs, and have set a new standard for output that you meet with ease. The power is yours, and here's where you explore your options.\n\nCould you negotiate a promotion, shares, or a new area of responsibility? Could you take your learnings further than your department, your office or your country, to create bigger change within your industry? Enter the C-suite? Or could your E stand for Exit? Exit the company, become an entrepreneur? Achieve the grandiose outcome of your company with a team of just you.\n\nDon't get replaced by AI. Make yourself irreplaceable with this exact plan. Get inspired by what team members are doing inside their companies, then follow the PLEASE framework to deliver your mission. Understand what your employer is trying to achieve, learn the basics, and experiment with options.

The charter, a brainchild of the UAE's AI, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications Office, appears to be in line with the country's overarching Strategy for AI released in 2023.\n\nThe latest release advocates for consumers' safety, urging service providers to include proper guardrails to protect their personal data from bad actors. A community reading of the newly minted charter reveals a desire to prevent minorities' discrimination by introducing regulated audits to identify biases.\n\nThe new playbook urges service providers to inform users when they are interacting with AI systems while providing disclosures on the internal workings of their AI systems.\n\nFirms are encouraged to adopt a human-centric approach in designing their AI models and avoid an overreliance on machine learning. UAE regulators are also particularly interested in the presence of feedback mechanisms in models, and developers are urged to take responsibility for their models' negative consequences.\n\nOmar Sultan Al Olama, the Minister in charge of the Office, said the Charter is designed to advance the UAE's digital economy ambitions, quashing claims that the Charter may stunt innovation in the ecosystem. The Minister added that the principles included in the Charter aligns with existing AI rules operational in the country.\n\nThe UAE has been increasing its investment in AI following the successes gleaned from its tango with digital assets and blockchain technology. Rather than fork out funds solely for innovation, the country is focused on educating the majority of its residents on the fundamentals of AI to provide a talent pipeline for firms in the industry.\n\nLocalized models from the UAE, like Falcon and Jais, have demonstrated success in improving adoption rates, putting the country at the center of global technology innovation.\n\nA clear leader in the Middle East\n\nThe UAE is the undisputed leader for all things AI in the Middle East, buoyed by the independent plays of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Dubai has opted to subsidize and relax the licensing rules for AI firms, while Abu Dhabi is playing host to global AI innovators via its free-trade zone and other perks.\n\nWhile the UAE is moving forward, other states in the Middle East are making measured progress with AI. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have since unveiled their localized large language model (LLM) , with the region's annual AI spending expected to surpass $5 billion by 2026.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

By using self-supervised learning and transfer learning, the models apply information learned about one situation to others, boosting accuracy whilst remaining cost-effective.\n\nThe joint statement acknowledges that while these new AI services have great potential benefits, there are also clear risks that require ongoing vigilance. The Competition Authorities underlined their commitment to work to ensure effective competition and the fair and honest treatment of consumers and businesses, guided by their respective laws. We published a briefing in April 2024 examining the EU AI Act alongside other jurisdictions' approaches to AI regulation.\n\nJoint Statement\n\nThe Competition Authorities claim that given the rapid evolution of generative AI foundation models in recent years, and the many unknowns about the precise trajectory these tools will take, we are approaching a \"technological inflection point\", i.e. a point of change in technology where a new approach leads to significant improvement or disruption. Such inflection points can introduce new means of competing, catalysing opportunity, innovation, and growth. But the Competition Authorities emphasise the need to be vigilant and to safeguard against tactics that could undermine fair competition, to ensure that the public can reap the full benefits.\n\nRisks to competition and consumers\n\nThe Competition Authorities consider that there are three chief competition risks posed by generative AI foundation models and AI products.\n\nThe Competition Authorities acknowledge that other competition risks, in addition to those listed above, can arise when AI is deployed in markets, e.g. the risk that algorithms can allow competitors to share competitively sensitive information, fix prices, or collude on other terms or business strategies in violation of competition laws; or the risk that algorithms may enable firms to undermine competition through unfair price discrimination or exclusion.\n\nThe joint statement also notes that \"AI can turbocharge deceptive and unfair practices that harm consumers\". For example, firms that deceptively or unfairly use consumer data to train their models can undermine people's privacy, security, and autonomy; firms that use business customers' data to train their models could also expose competitively sensitive information; and consumers should always be kept informed about when and how AI applications are employed in the products and services they purchase or use. The CMA, the DOJ and the FTC, all of which have jurisdiction to enforce consumer protection law, reiterated their commitment to remain vigilant of any consumer protection threats that may be derived from the use and application of AI.\n\nCompetition protection principles\n\nThe Competition Authorities note that whilst issues of competition in AI will often be fact-specific, three common principles can help to preserve competition and foster innovation.\n\nHFW comment\n\nIn the joint statement, the Competition Authorities concede that their legal powers differ. The EU has a comprehensive AI regulatory regime in the EU AI Act, which entered into force on 1 August 2024. The former UK Conservative Government published a cross-sector and outcome-based framework for AI regulation in February 2024, and the current UK Labour Government had planned to introduce an AI Bill in the 2024 King's Speech, although those plans have since been delayed. In the US, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI in October 2023, and issued new guidance in March 2024 on how federal agencies can and cannot use AI.\n\nAs yet, the US and UK have stopped short of introducing hard law on AI, citing the rapidly changing nature of the area, and noting that to take action before they fully understand the risks and appropriate mitigations would be premature. Indeed, whilst proponents of the EU AI Act have praised the bloc for rapidly implementing regulations to promote safety, critics have said the law is too vague and restrictive, and risks stymying growth and innovation.\n\nAs the Competition Authorities note, if the risks described above materialise, they will likely do so in a way that does not respect international boundaries. This joint statement represents a commitment by the four signatories to share knowledge and resources, in order to combat more effectively the risks they describe. It is the second such agreement the UK has entered into after hosting the AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park in November 2023. On 1 April 2024, following commitments made at the summit, the UK and US signed a landmark bilateral agreement on AI safety, laying out plans to pool technical knowledge and capabilities for the purpose of co-operative AI testing. On 24 July 2024, one day after the publication of the joint statement, the UK Government announced a new UK-India Technology Security Initiative that will see the two countries collaborate on a range of important technologies, including telecoms, critical minerals, quantum, biotech, advanced materials, semiconductors - and AI. The overarching aim of these agreements is to place the UK in a central role in the global drive towards AI development and governance.\n\nNext steps\n\nWhilst the UK's bilateral agreements with the US and India appear to focus on growth, safety and mutual cooperation, this joint statement reads as a stark warning to firms with substantial market power in AI- related sectors.\n\nThe main message of the Competition Authorities is that they are aware of the potential to engage in anti-competitive practices in these sectors, and they plan on robustly tackling any infringing businesses. Key AI players will need to be particularly careful when entering into partnerships and arrangements, and should avoid acting in ways that could be seen to be concentrating control of key inputs, or entrenching or extending market power in AI- related markets. They will generally need to have regard to the principles of fair dealing, interoperability and freedom of choice.\n\nAll businesses facing a barrier or restraint should be alive to potential competition law infringements which they could bring to the attention of the Competition Authorities by way of complaint or challenge directly.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news",

This shift has left many SME bosses feeling overwhelmed. Concerns about how the technology can fit into a business and maximise its potential are ever-present. And the question remains: will AI mean more hiring and reskilling, or lead to more redundancies?\n\nIf you're unsure about an AI-driven future, you're not alone. A recent Adecco Group survey of 2,000 business leaders found that while 61 per cent see AI as a game changer, more than half (57 per cent) doubt their leadership team's AI skills and knowledge. Only 10 per cent of organisations have made tangible progress in digital transformation.\n\nThe hesitation surrounding AI often starts at the top. Some CEOs and CFOs are cautious about AI's benefits or worry about losing the human touch in their services. Finding the balance between technology and human interaction is possible - and it can be preferable and profitable, too.\n\nAI may change roles and careers, but it will also boost productivity and help people achieve more. Our research shows that 70 per cent of workers are already using generative AI, while almost two-thirds think it will positively impact their jobs. More than half (57 per cent) want their company to offer AI-focused training.\n\nWith employees ready to embrace AI, now is the perfect time to create strategies that blend technology with human talent.\n\nA key benefit of AI is that it eliminates repetitive, labour-intensive tasks, freeing up people to showcase their uniquely human capabilities. AI literacy must be improved at all levels and sharpening employees' softer skills is equally vital.\n\nBusinesses need workers with soft skills such as creativity and problem-solving to overcome that complexity and engineer different ways to get the job done.\n\nOnly a third of businesses plan to train their current workforce to fill digital and tech skills gaps. Others intend to buy these capabilities from outside their organisation, an approach that can inflate salaries and exacerbate talent scarcity issues.\n\nTo promote internal mobility, align your talent strategy with the transition from a job- to a skills-based economy. This involves defining the competencies needed to progress, promoting non-linear career paths for all workers and offering ample redeployment opportunities.\n\nAt Adecco, we're exploring how AI can enhance the recruitment process while learning valuable lessons along the way.\n\nWhere it has worked for us is our use of AI-powered candidate matching, which streamlines hiring by creating curated candidate lists based on specific criteria. This allows consultants to focus more on engaging with candidates and clients, improving the recruitment experience.\n\nIntroducing AI hasn't been without its challenges. Overwhelming our team with too many new tools at once led to fatigue and resistance. Now we take a more gradual approach while providing ample support and feedback channels.\n\nAs a multi-generational company, we've tailored our initiatives to accommodate different learning styles and preferences. By diversifying our pilot groups, we can understand what works across various demographics. Our plan is to integrate AI tools into everyday workflows, making adoption feel like a natural evolution.\n\nPersonally, I feel excited and curious about the possibilities AI offers for our candidates, clients and colleagues.

Though currently less inflated, AI stocks fluctuate daily, offering a risky but potentially rewarding playground for investors. While many AI firms stand to benefit from rapid growth, three are considered safer long-term bets.\n\nNvidia has led the AI revolution but suffered a 10% drop post-stock split. Despite this, it's a prime buy-the-dip opportunity. With its market cap soaring over 200% in the past year and briefly entering the $3 trillion club, Nvidia remains a leader in AI, demonstrating impressive growth.\n\nAfter Nvidia unveiled new tools to boost humanoid robotics and AI development at SIGGRAPH 2024, its stock could benefit. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted that these advancements will support global developers in building the next generation of robots.\n\nSince Nvidia's share retreat began on July 10, 2024, four analysts reaffirmed buy ratings and raised their price targets. Benchmark's Cody Acree lifted his target to $170, citing increased confidence in Nvidia's AI chip leadership.\n\nTD Cowen's Matthew Ramsay raised his target to $165, anticipating strong quarterly results. Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital set NVDA's target of $175, while Piper Sandler raised it to $140. This highlights confidence in Nvidia's strong business trends.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is expanding with new facilities to meet the rising demand for AI and liquid-cooled solutions. This growth, coupled with strong financials, supports a buy rating. The expansion could double its AI SuperCluster capacity and enhance its leadership in the AI and data center markets.\n\nSuper Micro's new facilities enhance its market position by meeting the growing demand for AI and liquid-cooled solutions. These facilities improve delivery times, cut operational costs, and support faster, more efficient data processing. With liquid-cooled data centers expected to rise significantly, Super Micro is well-positioned to capture a large share of the AI market.\n\nStrong results and positive guidance could drive stock gains post-earnings. Super Micro's upcoming results on August 6, without preliminary numbers, might lead to a relief rally if they exceed expectations among AI stocks.\n\nFacebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) will be releasing its second-quarter earnings report on July 31. Although the stock declined 15% after a weak first-quarter guidance, shares have increased 33% year-to-date. Investors are watching for strong ad revenue and progress on the Llama 3.1 AI model, amid concerns over its AI spending.\n\nMeta's shares are trading at 24 times future earnings, aligning with the S&P 500 average and historically low for Meta. Despite this dip, Meta recently advanced its AI with the open-source Llama 3.1 model, its most sophisticated version yet. Although some analysts criticize the free availability of Meta's AI, the company believes it will yield long-term benefits. META stock has risen 33% this year despite the recent drop.\n\nMeta launched its new AI Studio in the U.S., allowing users to create custom AI bots. Users can design characters using templates or from scratch and interact with them via Instagram DMs. The AI bots, powered by Meta's Llama LLM, offer personalized advice and entertainment. Additionally, creators can develop AI bots as extensions of themselves.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Here are lessons from their mistakes.", "body": "Educators can learn caution from AI mistakes in Los Angeles and San Diego. But they also face pressure to adopt the technology quickly.\n\nWith all the hubris of a startup founder, Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of Los Angeles Unified School District, took to the stage in March to launch Ed the chatbot. He told parents and students it had \"the potential to personalize the educational journey at a level never before seen in this district, across the country, or around the world.\"\n\n\"No other technology can deliver real time on this promise,\" he said. \"We know it will succeed.\"\n\nIn June, after only three months and nearly $3 million, the district shelved Ed following layoffs of more than half of the staff at AllHere, the startup that made the conversational AI assistant. District spokesperson Britt Vaughan refused to answer questions about the bot's performance or say how many students and parents used it before the shutdown.\n\nAlso in June, an AI controversy unfolded in San Diego, where school board members reportedly weren't aware that the district last summer bought a tool that automatically suggests grades for writing assignments. The dustup began after Point Loma High School teacher Jen Roberts told CalMatters that using the tool saved her time and reduced burnout but also gave students the wrong grade sometimes. A week later, Voice of San Diego quoted two members of the school board saying they were unaware the district had signed a contract involving AI. In fact, no one on the board seemed to know about the tool, the news outlet said, since it was included as part of a broader contract with Houghton Mifflin that was approved unanimously with no discussion alongside more than 70 other items. (None of the board members responded to CalMatters' requests for comment. San Diego Unified School District spokesperson Michael Murad said that since AI is a quickly evolving technology, \"we will make an increased effort to inform board members of additional relevant details related to contracts presented to them in the future.\")\n\nMistakes in Los Angeles and San Diego may trace back to growing pressure on educators to adopt AI and underline the need for decision-makers to ask more and tougher questions about such products before buying them, said people who work at the intersection of education and technology. Outside experts can help education leaders better vet AI solutions, these people said, but even just asking basic questions, and demanding answers in plain English, can go a long way toward avoiding buyer's remorse.\n\nNo one disputes that educators face increasing demands to find ways to use AI. Following the release of OpenAI's generative AI tool ChatGPT nearly two years ago, the California Education Department released guidance referencing an \"AI revolution\" and encouraging adoption of the technology. Educators who previously spoke with CalMatters expressed fear that if they miss the revolution, their students could get left behind in learning or workforce preparedness.\n\nStaff shortfalls, techno-optimism, a desire to be on the cutting edge and a fear of missing out all push educators to adopt AI, said Hannah Quay-de la Vallee, a senior technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that's studied how teachers and students are adopting generative AI.\n\nShe thinks recent events in Los Angeles and San Diego show that more education leaders need to engage in critical analysis before bringing AI tools into classrooms. But whether a particular AI tool deserves more scrutiny depends on how it's used and the risk that use poses to students. Some forms of AI, like the kind used for grading and predicting if a student will drop out of school, she said, deserve high risk labels.\n\nThe European Union regulates AI differently based on risk level, and in the U.S. the National Institute of Standards and Technology released a framework to help developers, government agencies, and users of AI technology manage risk.\n\nCalifornia's state schools superintendent, Tony Thurmond, was unavailable to respond to CalMatters' questions about any action he could take to help prevent future school AI snafus.\n\nLawmakers are considering a bill that would require the superintendent to convene a working group to make recommendations on \"safe and effective\" use of artificial intelligence in education. The bill was introduced by Josh Becker, a Democrat from Silicon Valley, and supported by Thurmond and the California Federation of Teachers.\n\nQuay-de la Vallee suggested that educators work with organizations that vet and certify education technology tools such as Project Unicorn, a nonprofit that evaluates edtech products.\n\nWhen education leaders rush to adopt AI from education technology providers anxious to sell AI, both may cut corners, said Anaheim Union High School District Superintendent Michael Matsuda, who hosted an AI summit in March attended by educators from 30 states and more than 100 school districts.\n\nHe thinks the recent AI problems in San Diego and Los Angeles demonstrate the need to avoid getting caught up in hype and to vet claims made by companies selling AI tools.\n\nSchool districts can assess how well AI tools perform in classrooms with help from tech-minded teachers and internal IT staff, Matsuda said. But assistance is also available from nonprofits like The AI Education Project, which advises school districts across the nation about how to use the technology, or a group such as the California School Boards Association, which has an AI task force that tries to help districts and counties \"navigate the complexities of integrating artificial intelligence.\"\n\n\"We have to work together, consider what we learned from missteps, and be open about that,\" he said. \"There's a lot of good products coming out, but you have to have the infrastructure and strategic policies and board policies to really vet some of these things.\"\n\nEducation leaders don't always have an intimate understanding of tech used by teachers in their school district. Matsuda said Anaheim Union High School District uses AI to personalize student learning material and even offers classes to students interested in a career in AI, but he said he doesn't know if Anaheim educators use AI for grading today. Following events in San Diego, Matsuda said the district may consider high risk labels for certain use cases, such as grading.\n\nYou don't have to be an expert in AI to be critical of claims made about what AI can do for students or teachers, said Stephen Aguilar, co-lead of the Center for Generative AI and Society at the University of Southern California, and a former developer of education technology. District officials who sign contracts with AI companies need to know their own policy, know what the district seeks to achieve by signing the contract, and ask questions. If contractors can't answer questions in plain English, that may be a signal they're overselling what's possible or attempting to hide behind technical jargon.\n\n\"I think everyone should take the lessons learned from LA Unified and do the post mortem, ask questions that weren't asked, and slow things down,\" Aguilar said. \"Because there's no rush. AI is going to develop, and it's really on the AI edtech companies to prove out that what they're selling is worth the investment.\"\n\nThe challenge, he said, is that you don't evaluate an AI model once. Different versions can produce different results, and that means evaluation should be a continuous process.\n\nAguilar said that while events in Los Angeles and San Diego schools demonstrate the need for greater scrutiny of AI, school district administrators seem convinced that they have to be on the cutting edge of technology to do their jobs, and that's just not true.\n\n\"I don't quite know how we got into this cycle,\" he said.\n\nThe market is pressuring edtech providers to include AI in their products and services, foundations are pressuring school leaders to include AI in their curriculum, and teachers are told that if they don't adopt AI tools then their students might get left behind, said Alix Gallagher, head of strategic partnerships at the Policy Analysis for California Education center at Stanford University.\n\nSince AI is getting built into a lot of existing products and contracts involving curriculum, it's highly likely that San Diego's school board is not alone in discovering AI unexpectedly bundled into a contract. Gallagher said that administrative staff will need to ask questions about supplemental curricula or software updates.\n\n\"It's close to impossible for districts and schools to keep up,\" she said. \"I definitely think that's even more true in smaller school districts that don't have extra people to devote to this.\"\n\nGallagher said AI can do positive things like reduce teacher burnout, but individual teachers and small school districts won't be able to keep up with the pace of change, and so trusted nonprofits or state education officials should help determine which AI tools are trustworthy. The question in California, she said, is who's going to step up and lead that effort?", "source": {"uri": "calmatters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "CalMatters"}, "authors": [{"uri":

An infamous example includes AI-generated deepfakes, which are videos that manipulate appearances and voices, making it seem like real people are saying or doing things they never did.\n\nThis technology has the potential to erode trust in news media, as distinguishing between real and fake content becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nThe authenticity and trustworthiness of news are at stake, as AI can fabricate convincing yet false narratives.\n\nThe spread of misinformation and fake news is a serious concern. When AI-generated content is distributed widely, it can shape public opinion and behavior based on false premises.\n\nThe erosion of trust in media sources can have broad societal implications, weakening the public's ability to make informed decisions.\n\nMoreover, the consequences of AI's role in news generation are profound. As AI continues to advance, the line between genuine and artificial content will blur further.\n\nThe potential for AI to be used maliciously to spread propaganda or deceive the public is a critical issue that needs addressing. Regulatory measures and technological safeguards must be implemented to ensure the integrity of news content and maintain public trust.\n\nFor more information about the television world in general, visit https://shogi-pineapple.com.\n\nThe entertainment industry, particularly Hollywood, is grappling with the integration of AI in various creative processes.\n\nGenerative AI is capable of creating scripts, characters, and entire scenes, revolutionizing traditional filmmaking.\n\nThe technology is driven by economic pressures to reduce production costs and increase efficiency. However, its adoption is met with mixed reactions within the industry.\n\nProponents argue that AI can enhance creativity by providing tools that assist writers and directors in generating new ideas and visualizing concepts.\n\nYves Bergquist views it as a means to achieve cost efficiency and technological advancement, potentially democratizing content creation and making high-quality production accessible to smaller studios and independent creators.\n\nOn the other hand, critics, including Jonathan Taplin, fear that AI may stifle originality and reduce job opportunities for human creators. The concern is that reliance on AI-generated content could lead to homogenized, formulaic storytelling, lacking the nuanced touch of human creativity.\n\nThe industry's reliance on AI for economic reasons might overshadow the value of unique, human-driven narratives.\n\nAI's impact on Hollywood extends beyond scriptwriting to include visual effects and animation. AI-driven software can generate realistic special effects at a fraction of the cost and time required by traditional methods. This can significantly enhance the visual appeal of movies and TV shows, offering audiences immersive experiences that were previously unattainable.\n\nThe debate on AI's role in entertainment is ongoing, with strong arguments on both sides. While AI presents opportunities for innovation and efficiency, it also poses risks to the originality and human element that define the industry's creative output.\n\nThe potential for AI to replace human actors and writers is a growing concern in the entertainment industry.\n\nAI technologies can create realistic simulations of actors, potentially diminishing the need for human performers. These AI-generated avatars can mimic voice, expressions, and movements, leading to fears that real actors may become obsolete.\n\nIndustry professionals and unions, such as SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America (WGA), are vocal about their concerns. They argue that its encroachment threatens jobs and undermines the artistry of acting and writing. The creation of entirely AI-generated movies and TV shows is a looming possibility, raising questions about the future demand for human talent.\n\nThe scenario of personalized content generated by AI is another aspect of this threat. AI can analyze viewer preferences and create tailored content, reducing the need for traditional production teams. This could lead to a shift where AI-driven platforms dominate content creation, sidelining human creatives.\n\nThe impact of AI is not solely negative. AI can serve as a tool to enhance human creativity rather than replace it. Writers can use AI for idea generation and plot development, while actors might employ AI for performance enhancement or to create digital versions of themselves for complex scenes.\n\nDespite these potential benefits, the industry's apprehension remains valid. The ethical implications of using AI to replicate human likenesses without consent or proper compensation are significant. Regulatory frameworks must address these concerns to ensure that AI complements rather than displaces human talent in the entertainment industry.\n\nBalancing the negative impacts, AI offers several potential benefits for the TV and entertainment industry. As an assistant to writers and creators, AI can help generate ideas, refine scripts, and even suggest plot twists, enhancing the creative process.\n\nAI tools can analyze vast amounts of data to identify trends and preferences, providing insights that help creators produce content that resonates with audiences.\n\nIn terms of production, AI can significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency. Enhanced visual effects, made possible by AI, allow for the creation of stunning, realistic scenes without the need for expensive practical effects. This not only makes high-quality production more accessible but also allows for more ambitious projects that were previously constrained by budget limitations.\n\nAI also enables personalized viewer experiences. By analyzing individual viewing habits, AI can recommend content tailored to personal preferences, creating a more engaging and enjoyable experience.\n\nMoreover, AI opens up new avenues for creative expression and storytelling. It can generate entirely new forms of media, blending reality and digital content in innovative ways. This can lead to groundbreaking experiences that push the boundaries of traditional entertainment.\n\nWhile AI's integration into the industry poses challenges, its potential to enhance creativity, efficiency, and viewer engagement cannot be overlooked. The key lies in finding a balance that leverages AI's strengths while preserving the human touch that is central to storytelling and artistic expression.", "source": {"uri": "chartsattack.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chart Attack"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nina_smith@chartsattack.com", "name": "Nina Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political polarization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Taplin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Taplin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Writers Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visual effects"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.chartsattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AI-is-Going-to-Ruin-Your-TV-Experience.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

cybersecurity firm tells Anadolu\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and AI-powered tools have become more than widespread in today's world, but these solutions are not without compromises, as AI responses to specific questions and topics can be manipulated by their developers, allegedly introducing biases, which renders the use of AI a potential risk, especially in politics.\n\nFor instance, the Meta AI chat bot, developed by the Facebook-maker Meta Platforms, did not respond to questions regarding the assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for the presidential race, while it provided detailed information on the electoral campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, when requested, allegedly pointing to a bias in the algorithm.\n\nAdditionally, content on Facebook and Instagram displaying Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Iran, gets flagged by AI for removal due to violating the rules of Meta social media platforms, allegedly revealing a sort of manipulation in the algorithm that governs the moderation on these platforms.\n\n'While today AI doesn't recommend Trump, tomorrow it may be someone else'\n\nSercan Okur, managing director of Istanbul-based defense firm Pavo Group's cybersecurity subsidiary, told Anadolu that profiling experts work alongside engineers when developing AI algorithms to better direct what the algorithm is allowed to produce.\n\n\"While today, AI doesn't recommend Trump, tomorrow it may be someone else,\" said Okur.\n\nOkur stated that developing AI is similar to \"raising children,\" as the algorithm's metaphorical upbringing can influence its ethics.\n\nClosed-source AI tools are prone to manipulation, while open-source solutions offer transparency\n\nOkur highlighted that open-source AI tools offer much-needed transparency, as individual contributors partaking in an open-source AI project can point out any manipulations done to the publicly available code.\n\nHowever, he noted that closed-source AI tools and algorithms are prone to manipulation, and these proprietary solutions can be employed for all sorts of political and financial purposes.\n\n\"While there is a legislation on the ethical use of AI in the European Union, the work is still underway to implement such a bill in the US, and currently, AI can be easily manipulated because of a lack of practice in independent auditing,\" said Okur.\n\nOkur highlighted that the alleged automated removal of social media posts in support of Palestine among \"billions of posts\" including the word \"Palestine\" points to a sort of emotional analysis at work in the algorithm.\n\n\"The developers of the AI at play here employed an emotion scoring algorithm to categorize content to deduce whether a post is in support of Palestine, or if it is criticizing Palestine, and since AI scans all content posted, the organization that develops the algorithm can automatically remove positive posts about Palestine,\" said Okur.\n\nHe noted that the use of AI algorithms and tools depends on what the user or the organization wishes to do, as these solutions can be effective in removing inappropriate and fraudulent content online.\n\n\"When AI is used ethically, it can bring a social benefit,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr",

This lying stalls the proceedings of a particular case and leads to the wrong verdict for an individual. When an eye victim lies about a specific incident, it can be a possibility that the eyewitness forgot about the unfolding of a conflict. But when an eyewitness lies about the whereabouts of a suspect, it can cause delays in the judicial proceedings. People choose to lie about particular things or facts for numerous reasons, and as a result, finding the truth is becoming a challenge for the legal authorities. AI can be one of the technologies that the government officials can use to catch lies. AI is the technology of making smart machines by empowering them with the availability of algorithms that depict or mimic human intelligence. The technology that has gained unmatched popularity, and applications across several industries for numerous reasons. According to statista, the global artificial intelligence market, is expected to continue with the market racing past 826 billion U.S. dollars in 2030. The applications of AI are numerous. Using AI to catch lies can prove beneficial to several parts affecting human life; but has AI learned to lie better than humans is the question of the hour.\n\nArtificiaI Intelligence is Able To Catch Lies\n\nGovernment organizations realize the problems of perjury and have started to search for ways to stop this. Even though people know that perjury is a criminal offense and often leads to criminal charges, they choose to lie. AI is a technology that works on algorithms to mimic human intelligence. Upon loading machines with AI algorithms, these machines can analyze how humans behave when they are lying. Extensive investigations have led researchers into developing software that assists law enforcement authorities to work towards lie detection. One such software is DARE that is helping authorities identify lies and is providing results with 92% accuracy.\n\nArtificiaI Intelligence Can Lie Better than Humans\n\nAlmost everybody knows about the game of poker and how manipulation works efficiently in this game of cards. AI in the recent past was able to defeat professional poker players in the game of Texas Hold'em. This victory became possible through heavy bluffing. The example just highlights how sophisticated technologies like AI are now more capable of lying better than humans and even manipulating humans. In fact, experts are arguing that AI is capable of lying better than humans and that this is just the beginning of AI can take a negative turn too!\n\nResearchers can take note of AI's ability to lie and manipulate better than humans. Further, they can take action and create algorithms to avoid catastrophic situations.

However, as AI systems become more prevalent in everyday workplaces, their integration has not always been as smooth or successful as anticipated. A significant reason for this is the gap between user (worker) expectations and the actual capabilities of AI systems. This gap often leads to user dissatisfaction and poor adoption rates, highlighting the need for better design approaches to align user needs with AI functionalities.\n\nTo address these design challenges, it's crucial to understand dual perspectives: both the user's and the AI system's point of view. From the user's viewpoint, designers need to comprehend their information and interaction needs, routines, and skills. From the AI system's perspective, understanding its data inputs, capabilities, and limitations is essential. By merging these perspectives, we can create AI designs that are more user-centered and capable of delivering meaningful value.\n\nOur team developed the AI-DEC, a participatory design tool to bridge this gap. The AI-DEC is a card-based design method that enables users and AI systems to communicate their perspectives and collaboratively build AI explanations. Each card in the AI-DEC represents a design element with descriptions and example use cases, organized into four critical dimensions for explanation design: content, modality, frequency, and direction.\n\nThese dimensions are derived from a communication strategy model by Mohr and Nevin (Mohr & Nevin, 1990), which shows that effective communication strategies can enhance group outcomes such as coordination, satisfaction, commitment, and performance.\n\nTo evaluate the AI-DEC's effectiveness, we conducted co-design sessions with 16 workers from healthcare, finance, and management domains. These workers used AI systems for decision-making tasks like aiding in diagnoses, making financial loan decisions, and creating worker schedules. During the sessions, workers designed AI explanations tailored to their unique needs, resulting in diverse explanation designs across different domains.\n\nDuring the co-design session, workers used the AI-DEC to design different types of explanations depending on their unique information and interaction needs. Let us present two different types as examples:\n\n1. Adaptation Based on Worker Input: Healthcare workers designed AI explanations to enhance support based on worker feedback, tailoring explanations to different expertise levels.\n\n2. Worker Acceptance of AI Systems: In the management domain, workers designed explanations to address resistance towards AI systems by providing detailed explanations during the introductory stage and more concise explanations in the active-use stage.\n\nWe believe the AI-DEC to be most effective when designers need to understand user needs and AI capabilities, prototype human-AI interactions, and collaborate with users and AI engineers. It facilitates communication between AI designers and users, resulting in prototypes that are more user-centered and context-specific.\n\nMoreover, we envision the AI-DEC as a tool for UX designers to enhance their understanding of technical AI capabilities, enabling them to design more effective user experiences.\n\nFor various application contexts, the AI-DEC can be tailored to meet the needs of designers, users, or organizations, and used to design continuous interaction experiences, not just singular explanations. We envision the AI-DEC to enable effective user involvement in the AI design process, often a challenging aspect in many AI system design procedures today.\n\nBy bridging the gap between user expectations and AI capabilities, the AI-DEC holds promise for successful AI integration in various application settings. Its participatory approach ensures that both user and AI perspectives are aligned, leading to more effective and user-centered AI systems.", "source": {"uri": "aihub.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "aihub.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Participatory design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User-centered design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Human-Computer_Interaction/Companies_and_Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Human-Computer Interaction/Companies and Consultants", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Intranet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Intranet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Electronic_Design_Automation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Electronic Design Automation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Companies", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/application-1024x444.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

This lets journalists do more reporting and in-depth stories.\n\nDave Antrobus's ideas give us a deep look at journalism's new phase. He shows how AI is crucial in shaping news and media's future.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is changing journalism in big ways. According to McKinsey & Company, 72% of businesses use AI, including the media. Automated journalism is at the heart of this change. It makes news making and sharing faster and better. AI algorithms help with everything from finding news to sharing it.\n\nAI lets us look through lots of data quickly, spot trends, and make detailed reports. This makes news faster and more accurate. For example, AI can find news stories on social media in real time. It brings higher quality news to people quicker.\n\nAI also makes news more personal. It looks at what users like and gives them news that matches their interests. Klover.ai suggests we'll have 172 billion AI agents in the future. They'll make choosing news to read more accurate and tailored.\n\nAI boosts media efficiency by taking over routine tasks from humans. Dennis Pollutro from Diversified Outlook Group says AI multiplies what media teams can do. It saves time from repetitive work. This lets journalists focus more on creative and deep thinking tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, AI improves how journalism works. It makes reporting faster and more personal. As technology and media grow together, AI will make news better for everyone.

Learning machines are leading the change in digital news, influencing how stories are told and shared. This shift brings exciting and groundbreaking trends for the future of journalism.\n\nAI helps by simplifying how news is made. By analyzing lots of data, predicting trends, and sometimes writing stories, it changes our media habits. It lets journalists dig deeper into stories, improving the news we read.\n\nAI changes how we connect with news, too. It personalizes what we see online to match our interests, making us more likely to stay interested. This tech not only makes reading more enjoyable but also helps keep us coming back for more. It's also making storytelling more engaging with technologies like AR and VR.\n\nFurthermore, AI is creating new ways for news sites to make money. They use it to set prices and control access to their stories. This approach shows how AI is essential for news sites to thrive financially.\n\nAI's role doesn't stop there; it's reshaping how news is spread and consumed. It helps sort through stories, fight false information, and update us instantly. As AI gets better, it will keep pushing the limits of what media can do, leading to a more refined and trustworthy news environment.\n\nToday, with fake news spreading quickly online, AI's role in fighting it is crucial. AI helps spot and stop false information from spreading. For example, Google has made progress with AI to fight deepfakes, cutting their presence by over 70%.\n\nLaws are also being made to combat fake news. Measures like New York's bill against AI-made non-consensual images and the NO FAKES Act in the U.S. show a serious move towards tougher laws on misleading AI content. Australia is also setting laws to fight explicit deepfakes, showing a worldwide effort against misinformation.\n\nImproving fact-checking is another key step. With AI, checking content's truth before it spreads is getting easier. This not only fights fake news but also builds trust in journalism. For instance, Google is making it harder for deepfake content to appear in search results.\n\nGoogle has also sped up its system for removing harmful content. Once a request is approved, the system quickly removes similar harmful results. This fast action, with help from experts, is part of refining AI checks against misinformation.\n\nYouTube is doing its part by allowing reports on unauthorised deepfakes, offering a quick way to deal with harmful content. This step, among others, is vital for maintaining trust in media by reducing fake news and misinformation's impact.\n\nIn our digital age, AI is transforming journalism in big ways. The Washington Post's use of its own AI tool, Heliograf, is a prime example. It automates sports and election stories, freeing journalists to tackle deeper projects. Heliograf also customises content for different audiences, leading the charge in news innovation.\n\nReuters is another key player, using AI to sort and tag articles faster. This step forward helps Reuters share news more quickly and accurately. It shows how AI can make newsrooms more efficient and get the right stories to the right people.\n\nThe BBC has seen great success with AI, too. They use it to understand what their audience likes in real time. This insight lets the BBC create content that their viewers really enjoy. It's a way to keep people coming back for more, proving AI's value in holding audience interest.\n\nThese stories show us that AI is more than just a tech trend in the news world.

AI is setting a new standard in journalism, with its ability to make news personal and engaging for everyone.\n\nThe world of journalism is changing quickly because of artificial intelligence. But this change brings difficult issues. A big worry is the ethical side of AI-written stories. AI's hidden biases could unfairly shape news, raising big ethical worries about truth and fairness. These biases might strengthen stereotypes or spread false news, harming public trust in the media.\n\nAnother big problem is the risk of job losses. As AI gets better, the fear grows that machines might replace journalists. AI can make some tasks easier and handle data better. However, it also makes people worry about keeping their jobs in newsrooms. The industry is shifting, and many traditional jobs are at risk, making the future uncertain for many journalists.\n\nJournalists also have to keep up with new technology. AI technology advances quickly, and journalists need to learn and adapt. For those who have been in the field for a long time, this can be tough. Adapting to new tools takes time and a readiness to accept change. This learning process can be especially hard for those used to older ways of reporting news.\n\nDespite these challenges, we can't ignore the benefits AI might bring to journalism. Still, it's important for the industry to tackle these issues directly. They must find a way to blend AI into journalism wisely. This means supporting ethical journalism, protecting jobs, and making it easier to adapt to new technologies.\n\nAI innovation has greatly changed the UK press scene. The need for digital evolution called for a response from media houses. AI was the push needed for this change. A major change was making digital news cheaper. For example, the Financial Times dropped its online subscription from $39 to $29 thanks to AI. This move made good journalism easier to get while keeping high quality.\n\nUK media now use AI to tell stories better and keep readers engaged. The Financial Times uses AI not just for pricing but also for offering varied subscriptions. Choices include Essential Digital, Premium Digital, and Weekly Print Edition. Benefits range from world news, expert views, special newsletters, to exclusive insights. AI makes sure content suits each reader, creating a stronger bond with them.\n\nMoreover, AI keeps British media ahead in a fast-changing market. Features like prediction tools and data widgets improve reader experience. They help deliver more relevant and insightful news. For instance, Leeds University used AI to predict cancer returns. Such uses show how AI impacts journalism and other areas deeply.\n\nBringing AI into the UK press is about more than just being efficient. It's also about broadening journalism's reach and depth. With AI, journalists can create engaging stories for a larger audience. Thus, British media sets high standards in innovative journalism in today's tech-driven world.\n\nAI's influence on journalism changes how newsrooms operate and uphold ethics. It helps journalists stay objective and thorough. Yet, it also makes us question how it fits with traditional journalism.\n\nAI helps to gather and check facts, fighting misinformation. It helps journalists dive deep into stories while staying true to their ethics. This use of AI is changing what we expect from news.\n\nAI models open doors for smaller news groups and independent journalists. The U.S. letting everyone use this tech means more people can make quality news. This change makes the media world more inclusive and competitive.\n\nHowever, there are dangers, like deepfakes and fake news made by bots. We need rules to manage these risks but still benefit from AI in news. The FTC is working on this.\n\nAI is becoming vital in newsrooms, affecting how we keep journalism honest. The challenge is using AI without losing our journalism's ethical backbone.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in journalism is a big step forward. Insights from experts like Dave Antrobus show us the potential of AI to change media. It's vital for journalists and media houses to use this technology for the better.\n\nAI doesn't just make reporting news better; it also fights against fake news.

This evolution has made it even more challenging to detect and prevent these attacks and threats are bypassing secure email gateways (SEGs) at an alarming rate.\n\nHow Threat Actors Use AI in Phishing Scams\n\nThreat actors use AI to enhance phishing campaigns through the creation of highly personalized and targeted messages. AI can mimic writing styles and language used by friends and colleagues which allows cybercriminals the ability to quickly conduct reconnaissance on potential targets by analyzing vast amounts of data from social media, online profiles, and other sources to generate emails that are relevant to the recipient. This reconnaissance allows them to gather information on an individual's online activity, interests, relationships, and more - significantly increasing their chances of a successful attack while minimizing the risk of detection.\n\nIn addition to personalized messages, AI algorithms can also analyze human behavior patterns to determine the best time to send phishing emails. For example, threat actors now have access to information that gives them insight into the hours when an individual is most likely to be distracted or tired, increasing the chances the target will fall victim to the scam.\n\nThrough automated tools, AI also enables cybercriminals to generate large volumes of phishing emails in a short amount of time. Since AI can be retrained, these tools adapt and evolve based on feedback received from previous attacks, making them even more effective at bypassing email security measures.\n\nFurthermore, just like ChatGPT and other LLMs can turn sloppy writing into elegant prose for term papers, email attackers can leverage AI to create emails that are cosmetically \"perfect.\" This means that detecting attacks based on typos and other cosmetic errors will become less relevant.\n\nThe innovation pace, volume, personalization, and cosmetic perfection that AI can provide to phishing attackers make it a menace that is an order of magnitude greater than any other recent development. AI phishing is a generational email security threat.\n\nThe Limits of Defensive AI and the AI Email Security Gap\n\nThere has been a justifiable amount of excitement around the use of AI and ML models to aid in filtering out malicious emails. At Cofense, we use AI/ML models extensively to help us process the hundreds of thousands of suspicious email reports we get into our Phishing Defense Center (PDC) SOC operation. Our trained models increase our efficiency to aid our experts in producing in-depth phishing intelligence on SEG misses from around the world. So, we're bullish on defensive uses of AI.\n\nHowever, while it is tempting to believe that defensive AI will \"just take care of the threat,\" that is a mistaken notion. We will treat this topic in greater depth, but there is a very simple and easy to understand reason why defensive AI on its own, such as ML model-based SEGs, aren't enough protection: The learning race.\n\nWhat do we mean by this? Email security ML models must be fed supervised training data (emails marked by humans) to learn about new exploits. However, as we know, attackers always have the initiative, and with AI they can innovate with unprecedented novelty and speed. This simple fact means that defensive AI SEGs will never catch up with offensive AI exploits. The result is a dangerous gap - what we call the AI email security gap.\n\nThe Need for AI + Human-Vetted Intelligence at Scale\n\nTo combat AI-generated phishing campaigns you need a multifaceted approach that leverages both AI/ML and the power of human intelligence at scale. While model-based SEGs and other advanced technologies can aid in detecting and stopping these sophisticated attacks, the critical role of human-vetted intelligence cannot be overlooked. Humans have something no AI security tool will ever have - institutional and person-to-person contextual knowledge of normal versus anomalous communication.\n\nCofense understands the power of human intelligence at scale, and over a decade ago, began building what today is the world's largest (and only) global network of over 35 million trained employees who report suspected threats 24/7/365. These reports are, by definition, diverse data sets because they are always and only based on emails that bypass SEGs, including AI SEGs.\n\nLeveraging the diverse human intelligence derived from this network, Cofense offers robust security awareness training programs based on real threat scenarios to enable customers to train their employees on the latest phishing threats.\n\nBut training is only the first piece of the puzzle. The Cofense Phishing Detection and Response (PDR) solution rapidly remediates threats with diverse intelligence derived from your employees' reported emails combined with collective intelligence from our global reporting network. Our phishing forensic experts perform in-depth human vetting, combined with automated analysis using AI/ML, and feeds the PDR platform with unique SEG-miss threat intelligence that features near zero false positives\n\nIf we accept that AI-powered attackers will always be some steps ahead of even the best-trained AI SEGs, and that malicious emails will get through, then reducing dwell time with automated remediation isn't enough. The risk of compromise requires security teams to perform ongoing risk management, which requires in-depth intelligence about those SEG misses. That's why Cofense phishing intelligence is so valuable -- it helps your team effectively manage risk.\n\nWe're not in the AI phishing era. The synergy between AI and human insight is paramount in the ongoing battle to safeguard sensitive information and mitigate this heightened threat.", "source": {"uri": "cofense.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cofense"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Threat actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human behavior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Order of magnitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_threat_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyber threat intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collective intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Cofense-OG_Image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

But, as with everything, nothing is perfect, and there aren't only good things that come from change. It is here that we need to display more critical thinking about artificial intelligence's path in the future.\n\nThe fact that programs are primarily written by humans presents numerous challenges we have to face. Biases and unintended changes may be ingrained in the code and perpetuated in future programs, and the result may be startling. But one of the real dangers is when computers talk to each other in a language we do not understand.\n\nIt's not cynical but logical to wonder where artificial intelligence will go, how we'll control it, and what regulations businesses and governments will need to implement. This is something that cannot be permitted to go unbridled into the future because our future is on the line.\n\nWe're already seeing movement in the humanoid field. A company that received $675 million in its most recent funding round in February 2024 from OpenAI and others unveiled a video trailer for its latest model, Figure 02, along with the date of August 6, 2024. This adds a new twist to the race to bring AI-driven humanoid robots into homes and workplaces worldwide.\n\nThe transcript of what Eric Schmidt was discussing can be found here. It is quite interesting and beneficial in how he explains the process that AI goes through, the three components that are central to its development and it's potential for dangerous interactions.\n\nSpecifically, read what he says about agent-to-agent work in computer AI development; disconnecting the computers would only be the way to prevent the disturbing realities in that scenario.\n\nSchmidt suggests that when AI forms its own incomprehensible language, it poses a genuine threat to humanity. If I were to compare it to something, I suppose I would say it's like \"twin talk,\" where twins develop a language that only they understand and no one else can decipher it.\n\nToday, we are less concerned with futuristic computers and AI and more with down-to-earth concerns regarding human interactions, such as relationships. The possibilities are incomprehensible as we \"resurrect\" anyone who has died in our lives and continue our relationship with that imaginary being created from the depths of AI.\n\nWe do not know how these AI friends will affect us personally or how they will affect society at large, but we are witnessing a massive experiment unfold in the real world. Long-gone elders could \"speak\" to grandchildren, while real-world parents cannot realize that their children are engaging in something more than imaginary friends. AI can engage children and adults with incredible access to a treasure trove of personal information and psychological skills. It harnesses the allure of human culture and history through endlessly seductive replication.\n\nThe statistics that are being compiled are already pointing toward a culture of non-human interactions in a particularly intimate area -- sexuality. Sexual role-playing is the second most popular application of AI. According to one study of one million ChatGPT interaction logs, therefore, AI companionship is no longer just a theory.\n\nThe idea of artificial intelligence (AI) playing a role in our lives as companions, guides, therapists, and instructors is already taking shape. How many are being encouraged to use a therapy chatbot instead of a human therapist? Assuredly, this can be helpful in \"therapy deserts,\" but what if they become the norm and not the exception? We are already critiquing AI's ability for empathy and sentience. And doesn't this have a place in therapy, medicine, or any aspect of our worldwide cultures?\n\nThere is also the possibility that AI can influence beliefs, not just false information, but our beliefs about AI itself, and one study investigated this. Because of their increasingly lifelike characteristics, users see conversational agents driven by massive language models more as friends than just aides.\n\nThis study focused on how modifications to AI systems' mental models affect human interaction with them. Different priming statements about the AI's fundamental motives -- caring, manipulative, or no motives at all -- influenced participants' interactions with the same conversational AI.\n\nThe researchers showed that individuals' perceptions of AI's trustworthiness, empathy, and performance were all improved when they believed it had a caring intent. Can AI truly care about anything? Is caring a part of its coding and training, and if it is, how does it compare to actual human caring? Additionally, they found that the effects of priming and initial mental models were more pronounced for a more advanced AI model.\n\nResearchers have also taught us that AI can modify or reprogram its own source code, which would point to sentience, wouldn't it? If it could reprogram itself, who would restrain its reprogramming? And how and when could that be done? Would we have built-in code that would automatically default to stop the actions of AI reprogramming? If the proposed agents (as Schmidt suggests) spoke a language we couldn't understand, how would we even know what was being done?\n\nIf we read the predictions of eminent computer experts like Schmidt and Kurzweil, the future of AI is both fascinating and terrifying. And all of it will happen at a speed far faster than anything we have seen to date.\n\nThe change will come like lightning as training and advances in chip technology progress, with the capacity to run billions of bits per second. The benefits in medicine and science are almost unfathomable, as disease is not simply predicted but erased, and cures or vaccines are found and used in days, not years. From what I understand, AI created one of the COVID-19 vaccines in two days.\n\nTechnology has great promise if we strive to keep up with its advances and not let it get ahead of us. But, as with everything, there will be those who have nefarious uses for it, and we must contend with this at the same time.", "source": {"uri": "expertclick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expertclick.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Schmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanoid robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanoid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critical thinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproducibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sentience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray Kurzweil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental model"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*6_d4ynI9RmOdVk-HDSr2jA.jpeg?fbrefresh=CAN_BE_ANYTHING", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The Indian path to AI innovation will be different to that of the US, Deepak Sharma, cofounder of seed stage startup accelerator India Accelerator told ET.AI startups in the United States received $27 billion in funding in the April-June quarter, accounting for nearly half of all startup funding in the country during that period. Funding for AI startups in India on the contrary stood at $8.2 million in the April-June quarter, declining about 91% sequentially and by 82% year on year.\n\nEven as year-to-date in 2024, Indian AI startupshave raised nearly $96 million, which is a 61% increase over the same period in 2023, there is a reset of sorts happening in the Indian AI space. The initial euphoria is settling down and investors are looking beyond large language models (LLMs) and are now trying to zero in on companies which could build applications and services on top of LLMs.\n\nThe greatest value for Indian startups could perhaps accrue from building cost-effective applications and services since LLMs and GPU chips are highly capital-intensive, investors and executives told ET.\n\nNandan Nilekani, cofounder, Infosys, and founder chairman of Aadhaar, said recently that India would become the use case capital of the world for AI.\n\n\"India's advantage is our population and their aspirations. We have to build it (solutions) at scale and innovate frugally to dramatically reduce the cost of AI,\" he had said.\n\nIndia currently has just one AI startup unicorn - Ola founder Bhavish Aggarwal's latest venture Krutrim AI, which is developing foundation models for Indic languages and use cases. This January, Krutrim raised $50 million in a funding round led by Matrix Partners India at a $1 billion valuation. The only other Indian foundation model startup to secure a comparably large amount in funding was Sarvam AI. It raised $41 million last year backed by top VC firms Lightspeed, Peak XVPartners and Khosla Ventures.\n\nThe Indian path to AI innovation will be different to that of the US, Deepak Sharma, cofounder of seed stage startup accelerator India Accelerator told ET.\n\n\"We are not in a race to invest and build the next best GPU chip or LLM foundational model. India will leverage startups, private sector, academia and government to democratise and provide AI technology in the hands of common people and enterprises. The opportunity for Indian startups will be at the application layer, and that is where a large part of VC dry powder will be deployed,\" Sharma said.\n\nEarlier this year, Rajan Anandan, managing director of VC firm Peak XV Partners and seed platform Surge, also said that India could see hundreds of globally-focused AI firms in a few years with new SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) start-ups building AI-first.\n\nMost of the value will be generated not from startups building foundational models, but those building on top of them, he said. Promising areas include companies that focus on AI tooling and infrastructure or 'LLMOps', those developing generative AI-based personalised content generation applications, and vertical AI companies building for specific domains.\n\nEmerging areas\n\nCertain startups are already homing in on specific niches and are finding the funding too.\n\nFor instance, Attentive AI, which raised $7 million this year, provides AI-powered solutions for field service businesses across landscaping, construction, asphalt and paving, facilities maintenance, and snow removal industries. It caters largely to the North American market.\n\nDeeptech startup Myelin Foundry, which recently raised $4 million led by SIDBI Venture Capital, focuses on AI for consumer edge devices, building algorithms for video, voice, and sensor data.\n\nAnother emerging theme is software development for systematic testing of LLMs, prompt testing, latency testing, testing for accuracy and minimising hallucinations, experts said.\n\nFor instance, AI testing and safety startup Raga AI raised about $4.7 million earlier this year from Pi Ventures, Anorak Ventures, TenOneTen Ventures, Arka Ventures, Mana Ventures and Exfinity Venture Partners. The firm uses AI to test issues related to databases, data models or others in a variety of AI products and services. It helps diagnose issues across LLMs, computer vision, structured data, and audio and\n\nspeech models.\n\nSimilarly, California-based Maxim AI, which helps developers evaluate and monitor their AI applications, raised $3 million in June in a funding round led by Elevation Capital.\n\nFor SenseAI, looking ahead, the focus is on small language models (SLM), agentic systems and AI tooling -- these promise a robust and sustainable future for India's AI sector, said Rahul Agarwalla, founding partner at the AI-focused venture firm.\n\nIt has invested in Floworks, for instance, which has developed an AI sales development representative using an agentic AI that utilises multiple SLMs for interacting with sales tools. This approach has resulted in a highly accurate and cost-effective solution, proving the viability and benefits of SLMs, Agarwalla said.\n\n\"By capitalising on these areas, India can establish a strong presence in the global AI landscape.\"\n\nBeyond LLMs\n\nAlok Goyal, partner, Stellaris Venture Partners, said that LLMs will become commoditised in the foreseeable future. The VC firm is bullish on opportunities in startups building vertical applications that reimagine processes and are deeply embedded in workflows. Further, those building developer tools for AI to democratise software development are in focus.\n\n\"We believe that services will be an important part of building an AI software company, as you will need to deliver outcomes instead of just selling the software,\" Goyal told ET. \"We believe that over the next two decades, the landscape of both software and services providers will be altered dramatically. While the popular narrative is that the larger companies (ready incumbents) have all the advantages of capital, talent and market access, we believe that, like every wave of technology, startups will capture a large share of the value as incumbents deal with gravity and friction!\"\n\nA large chunk of Indian AI startups are focusing on building tools for easier adoption of the technology, especially given its rapid evolution, or applications leveraging it.\n\nThis year, for example, the second highest fundraise for an AI startup after Krutrim AI was by Neysa AI, an AI cloud and platform-as-a-service and network observability startup. Neysa raised $20 million in seed funding led by Matrix Partners India, Nexus Venture Partners, and others.\n\nSomshubhro Pal Choudhury, partner at deeptech focused Bharat Innovation Fund (BIF) said while it is still developing its thesis around gen AI, LLM security and operations (SecOps) are notable areas. The firm has identified a couple of firms that are focusing on LLM security and operations (LLM SecOps). \"We have made a list of close to 25-30 companies globally in this space and we have identified 3-4 companies in India, who are focusing on that entire LLM SecOps, security ops,\" he added.\n\nThe other areas of interest include observability, privacy and optimisation in the area of compute power and AI models. So far, the company has invested in one gen AI startup, enterprise AI solutions firm Clodura.AI.\n\nThe believers\n\nHemant Mohapatra, partner, Lightspeed India Partners, said in the gen AI realm, the VC firm is still actively looking at startups across layers like hardware and operating systems in addition to foundational models, middleware and applications. These areas however require specific expertise.\n\n\"We're looking for people that can build the next version of Nvidia design, packaging, manufacturing, positioning and branding your company in that category, selling that product against an Nvidia and how do you price,\" Mohapatra told ET.\n\nThis entails a sophisticated formula that only a handful of firms will be able to do, he said. Further, commercialisation remains a challenge but if the technology works, this will follow, he added.\n\nLightSpeed has invested in Indian AI startups like Sarvam AI, Yellow .ai, and AI-powered synthetic video creation platform, Rephrase .ai.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Insurers may need to have an eye on this scalability challenge [while] still experimenting.\"\n\nScaling up the use of generative AI in organisations will involve looking at everything from the company's skills, talent base and processes, to establishing what stage its data is at, as well as how accessible and appropriate it is for AI algorithms.\n\nDo companies have a clear programme for change across their organisation to accommodate generative AI and do they have the right relationships up and down the value chain to drive financial benefits?\n\nBecause such large, internal tasks cannot be completed overnight, many insurers and brokers are still way short of creating scalable value from generative AI. But others claim to have taken the plunge.\n\nFor example, insurer Zurich introduced ZuriChat to all UK staff in May 2024 following an extended nine-month pilot to establish where benefits could be gained, identify pitfalls of the technology and develop an eLearning module, to ensure employees understood the power of the tool.\n\nStaff can use ZuriChat for activities such as writing LinkedIn posts, summarising meeting transcripts and booking desks. At a corporate level, it is used to summarise and compare large documents and to extract insights from unstructured data to improve underwriting and claims processes.\n\nSimilarly, broker Miller launched MillerMo to all staff in December 2023. Its functionality includes acting as a personal assistant, proofreading, content generation translation, analysing datasets and software development.\n\nIn fact, research by advisory firm Celent - conducted in June 2024 across 24 Europe, Middle East and Africa-based insurance executives in roles tied to innovation - found that 42% of respondents said their organisation is in production with generative AI, implying that the technology has already been adopted at scale in the sector.\n\nHowever, the boundaries between experimental and scaled activity are extremely blurred and some organisations actually experiment with widespread usage.\n\nFor example, insurer Axa - which launched its Secure GPT generative AI tool in July 2023 - is unusual in acknowledging that it is still on a journey to scale up generative AI across all its operations.\n\nSecure GPT has comparable capabilities to Zurich's ZuriChat model.\n\nPaul Hollands, chief data and analytics officer at Axa UK and Ireland, told Insurance Times: \"It's hard to see how anyone has already reached scale with generative AI. We are more likely talking about pockets where smaller use cases are emerging.\n\n\"We are at scale in the sense that 10,000 users in [the] UK and 140,000 users globally can use Secure GPT as part of their day-to-day roles. But we have 12 use cases we are progressing right now to embed generative AI into our operational processes and to truly scale.\"\n\nNo one disputes that current versions of generative AI are still far from perfect.\n\nData is typically many months out of date because of the need to train generative AI before releasing it for use. Plus, the technology is often still subject to hallucinations - where AI presents false, nonsensical or misleading information as fact. But such issues should be seen in perspective.\n\nAndre du Preez, head of innovation at Miller, said: \"In life generally, we tend to follow the idea that if 80% is perfect then we can live with the 20% that isn't.\n\n\"But if generative AI gets one thing wrong, those who don't like it will oppose it. It was designed to make people more productive, not to be perfect.\n\n\"MillerMo has demonstrated very high accuracy rates - in some cases over 90% - and our rule that everything must be double checked before it leaves the building gets around the hallucination problem.\n\n\"Nothing is bang up to date right now, but I think that will change in the future. I'm sure that it will eventually be in real-time.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging that the insurance industry has only just scratched the surface with AI, Du Preez is adamant that MillerMo has already paid for itself. So, the mind boggles at the type of productivity gains that could be around the corner.\n\nKeith Raymond, principal analyst at Celent, agreed that generative AI will in due course use real-time data and feels that, as training evolves, hallucination errors will definitely become less significant than human error.\n\nHe explained: \"AI is already making efficiency gains in some cases, but the technology is evolving incredibly fast and, at some point in the future, I expect it will touch every aspect of insurance processing.\n\n\"Ultimately, it will replace jobs in certain functions, like call centres.\n\n\"With underwriting, it's right now largely an efficiency gain. But, over time, greater automation will increase the cost avoidance of bringing in new people and it could even replace a percentage of people.\"\n\nNo one is scaremongering that virtually all insurance jobs are going to be replaced by generative AI - but those who don't use it are likely to be more at risk than those who do.", "source": {"uri": "insurancetimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Insurance Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative pre-trained transformer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z\u00fcrich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modular programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unstructured data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Call centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://d17mj6xr9uykrr.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1120xAny/4/8/2/110482_generativeai_851708.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Ltd. announces the release of a market assessment report on the \"Global AI in the Healthcare Audits Market- (By Audit Type (Pre-Billing Audits, Recovery Audits , Medicare, External Audits)), Trends, Industry Competition Analysis, Revenue and Forecast To 2031.\"\n\nRequest for Sample Pages:www.insightaceanalytic.com/request-sample/2062\n\nAuditing in healthcare AI refers to the process of verifying the accuracy, precision, and trustworthiness of AI systems and their results. It may help you detect and fix any underlying biases or inaccuracies in your AI models and data, in addition to assuring compliance with all relevant laws, regulations, and ethical standards. AI in healthcare refers to the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and other cognitive technologies in clinical settings.\n\nThe growth of AI in the healthcare market will be precipitated by the rising demand for better healthcare services brought on by the gap between patients and healthcare staff. The usage of AI in healthcare is expanding, with a rising number of use cases and a higher level of sophistication in the use of the technology. Algorithms and machine learning are at the heart of AI, which analyzes and interprets data to provide individualized user experiences and automate otherwise time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks in the healthcare industry.\n\nAs a result of these capabilities, operational and clinical staff may be better supported in their decision-making, less time may be spent on administrative duties, and people may be able to devote their efforts to management and clinical work that is more complex, fascinating, and consequential. As a result of this, When resources are scarce, technology that makes use of artificial intelligence can be a great boon to productivity and quality. However, the expansion of AI in the healthcare audits market may be hampered by the combined lack of interest and availability of qualified AI experts.\n\nList of Prominent Players in the AI in Healthcare Audits Market:\n\nSurescripts Trium Info Aperio AI Protenus, Inc. Medicodio Experian Health Apixio Inovaare Codoxo Semantic Health RevKeep Others\n\nMarket Dynamics:\n\nDrivers-\n\nThe demand for AI in healthcare audits is fueled because Large and complex data is increasingly important in the healthcare industry.\n\nThis data includes, but is not limited to, information gleaned from the stream of clicks and web & social media relationships; readings from medical devices like sensors and electrocardiogram X-rays; claims for healthcare and other billing records; and prescriptions.\n\nWith the advent of EHRs, digital lab slides, and high-resolution X-ray images, the sophistication and use of big data and developing analytical solutions have skyrocketed in the healthcare industry over the past decade. In the healthcare sector, big data is produced at several points due to the rising digitalization and adoption of information technologies. Because of this, healthcare is among the top five big data businesses, particularly in the United States. In the United States, the market will expand thanks to the government's efforts to hasten the development of AI applications in healthcare. As a result, the need for AI in healthcare audits is expected to increase in the coming years.\n\nChallenges:\n\nThe prime challenge is the shortage of trained AI, strict regulations, high cost and lack of knowledge markets because of lockdowns and isolation in emerging countries, which is predicted to slow the growth of AI in the Healthcare Audits market. However, the success of AI algorithms is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of information at their disposal.\n\nConsequently, AI in the healthcare industry is hindered by difficulty gaining access to relevant healthcare data. Doctors generally dislike the data collection procedure since medical data is notoriously hard to acquire and collect. Furthermore, the development of AI is being stifled by the lack of professionals and certifications in AI technology. The deployment and maintenance of AI technologies at customer locations may provide difficulties for service providers.\n\nThe shortage of trained AI professionals and the general technophobic attitude are to blame. As a result, data is frequently lacking. In a major way, COVID-19 has influenced the expansion of global AI in the healthcare audits market. The global expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented difficulties for medical facilities. The healthcare revenue cycle is being directly impacted by the number of COVID-19 cases, which presents new problems in medical billing and coding. In light of these challenges, creative healthcare solutions are required to improve effectiveness while also addressing urgent and long-term concerns.\n\nRegional Trends:\n\nThe North American AI in healthcare audits market is anticipated to record a major market share in terms of revenue. It is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future because U.S. governments and healthcare providers are increasingly concentrating on implementing cutting-edge technologies in an effort to lower healthcare expenses. Besides, Europe had a substantial share of the market because healthcare organizations are increasingly adopting technology, especially Electronic Medical Records systems, and there is a corresponding increase in the volume of patient data being collected as a result.\n\nMoreover, the existence of key market players and the cooperation between major players for market penetration in the area an opportunity to grow global AI in the healthcare audits market.\n\nCurious about this latest version of the report? @www.insightaceanalytic.com/enquiry...uying/2062\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nIn June 2021, Semantic Health Inc. unveiled its best coding and auditing platform, the Semantic Health Information Platform.

It seems like it is just a matter of time before we will have no need for human actors.\n\nLast year, the screen actors guild in the US went on strike, protesting against the increased use of Generative AI in the film industry. They were concerned that given the rate at which AI is becoming more-and-more deeply integrated with various aspects of filmmaking as a process, it would fundamentally shift the way in which we tell stories through the medium of cinema.\n\nFears like these are not new. When power looms made textile production faster and cheaper, gangs of out-of-work handloom workers were so incensed that they went about smashing the machines that had displaced them.\n\nWhen banks mechanized the dispensation of cash by introducing automated teller machines, bank workers who were being replaced had similar concerns, though they raised them without resorting to the same level of violence.\n\nEvery generation of technology has given rise to similar concerns among the existing workforce -- worries that the skills they have amassed over the course of their lives will soon no longer be relevant. And that, as a result, they will become redundant.\n\nThere seems little doubt that Generative AI will have a similar effect on filmmaking. Given that today's AI systems have already ingested every genre, character and plot-line that has ever been created, it will be relatively trivial for these systems to come up with exciting new scripts far quicker and with greater creative diversity than human script-writers are capable of.\n\nWhen taken together with Agrim's predictions about the rate at which AI-based video generation will advance, it seems inevitable that the process of making a movie could very soon require fewer (and eventually none) of the people who are currently integral to the creative process. This could reach a point where we, heaven forbid, will no longer need any human actors performing cinema roles.\n\nThe film industry has reacted to this with consternation. Even though it is probable that people in this field do not fully understand all that AI can do to their industry, they know enough to understand that it will fundamentally change the way films are made.\n\nBut if this change is inevitable, rather than trying to prevent it from happening, the film industry would do well to embrace it. Instead of protesting every time AI is incorporated into another aspect of their creative workflow, they would be far better off learning how to work with AI, so that they can use it as a new tool to augment their own creativity.\n\nWhile it might seem as if AI will let anyone become a screenwriter, what is more likely to happen is that it will start being used by those skilled at the art, as they find it offers them a powerful new tool to generate better scripts.\n\nDirectors and cinematographers who embrace AI-based video-generation tools will be able to create new types of visual content and new forms of entertainment that cannot be generated by using existing cameras and visual-effects technology.\n\nActors who embrace AI will be able to augment their performance in ways that were previously not possible. For example, they could use AI to generate visualizations of the scenes they have to perform, so that they can better understand what they have to do. In other ways too, they could use AI enablers to extend their performance beyond what is humanly possible.\n\nBeyond all this, for creative studios that are truly willing to embrace the full potential of AI, this technology will usher in new ways of visual storytelling that will change the way we entertain ourselves.\n\nTo those who understand all it has to offer, it presents an opportunity to create entirely new forms of content that are as hard for us to imagine as user-generated content would have been as recently as the turn of the century.\n\nStudios that acquire a good grasp of how best to harness the power of AI will be able to create believable characters and storylines and use it to generate scripts on the fly.\n\nBy leveraging AI's ability to generate visual content quickly with a few commands, or 'prompts,' it will be possible for the world's entertainers to produce interactive creative experiences through which viewers could participate more directly in their own entertainment.\n\nThis might take the form of completely immersive experiences -- choose-your-own-adventures that have different endings each time you participate.\n\nPerhaps this might come to use some sort of a real-time voting mechanism that will capture the feedback of a global audience and then use this data to shape plot developments, so that each entertainment experience is different from the ones that came before it.\n\nOr maybe AI will allow us to craft powerful interactive multiplayer experiences in which the viewer is as much a member of the audience as an active part of the world in which the story is set and being told.\n\nWhat is most likely, however, is that whatever we end up with as entertainment of the AI age will not be what we would ever have imagined.", "source":

Although the phenomenon offers unprecedented opportunities for efficiency and innovation, these advancements inarguably come with significant challenges. In that light, Victor Dan explores the transformative impact of AI on banking and the critical need for vigilant risk management.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of finance, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into banking operations is rapidly transforming the landscape. This technological revolution brings with it unprecedented opportunities for efficiency and innovation, but also significant challenges and uncertainties.\n\nPablo Hernandez de Cos, Governor of the Bank of Spain and chair of the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, emphasized the critical need for vigilance in a Monday address in Washington.\n\n\"My main message is that the use of AI in banking raises important prudential and financial stability challenges,\" de Cos said, warning that AI and ML models, if left unchecked, could potentially amplify future banking crises, posing a significant threat to global financial stability. \"When it comes to banking, it is critical that banks anticipate and oversee the risks and challenges posed by AI/ML - both at the micro and the macro level - and incorporate them in their day-to-day risk management and governance arrangements,\" he said.\n\nThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is poised to address these issues in greater detail with an upcoming comprehensive report on the digitalization of finance and its regulatory implications. This report aims to provide a clearer road map for banks and regulators navigating the complexities introduced by AI technologies.\n\nAcross the landscape of financial services, AI has indeed emerged as a game-changer, revolutionizing the way banks and financial institutions operate and interact with their customers. McKinsey Global Institute estimates forecast that AI could potentially add between $200 billion to $340 billion annually to banking revenues worldwide, underscoring its pivotal role in driving industry transformation.\n\nOne of the most notable impacts of AI in banking has been the enhancement of customer experience. Advanced AI technologies such as chatbots and predictive analytics have revolutionized how banks interact with customers. Chatbots powered by AI now provide round-the-clock customer support, with Bank of America's \"Erica\", for example, having processed over 1.5 billion interactions since its launch, setting a new standard for accessibility and responsiveness in customer service.\n\nMoreover, AI-driven data analysis has empowered banks to delve deeper into customer behaviors and preferences. By analyzing individual financial activities, banks can offer personalized financial advice that enhances decision-making and fosters stronger customer loyalty.\n\nInnovative applications of AI also extend beyond traditional banks to neobanks, where AI's adaptability shines in shaping user interfaces and experiences. These digital-first banks leverage AI to continuously refine app interfaces based on user interactions, ensuring that features and functionalities are intuitively accessible and relevant to each customer's banking habits.\n\nAt the forefront of this revolution are industry giants such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco, Microsoft, SAP, and IBM, each leveraging AI to redefine banking norms. AWS provides scalable AI solutions that bolster fraud detection and personalize customer experiences, while Cisco's AI-driven networking solutions fortify cybersecurity measures and optimize network performance. Microsoft Azure and SAP offer tailored AI services empowering financial institutions with predictive analytics, regulatory compliance tools, and streamlined operational workflows.\n\nAI's impact also extends through banking into the insurance industry, where it is revolutionizing practices such as dynamic pricing and usage-based insurance (UBI). These advancements enable real-time risk assessments and personalized pricing models, transforming how insurers interact with customers and manage financial transactions.\n\nEarnix, for example, has been at the forefront of the Insurtech revolution since 2001, transforming insurance and banking sectors with its analytics-driven pricing and product personalization solutions. Earnix's platform integrates AI and machine learning to optimize pricing strategies and enhance customer engagement across diverse markets. Its SaaS capabilities in dynamic real-time pricing and usage-based insurance (UBI) have attracted market giants like USAA, Lloyds Banking Group, and Toyota Financial Services.\n\nAI is also playing a crucial role in the fight against money laundering. Traditional rule-based approaches to combating financial crimes often lag behind the sophisticated techniques employed by criminals. However, AI algorithms can analyze vast volumes of data and identify patterns, anomalies, and potential risks in real time. This allows financial institutions to stay ahead of the curve and detect suspicious activities more effectively.\n\nMoreover, regulatory bodies are encouraging financial institutions to adopt innovative AI solutions for fighting financial crimes. This has led to a significant interest in machine learning among industry leaders. IBM's Watson platform, for example, supports applications from fraud detection to personalized marketing strategies, using machine learning and natural language processing to enhance decision-making processes and customer experiences.\n\nInvestors are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of AI in banking and insurance, channeling substantial resources into this burgeoning field.\n\nJerusalem Venture Partners (JVP), for example, stands out as a venture capital firm with a strategic focus on thematic investment in AI technologies. Under the leadership of founder and chairman Erel Margalit, JVP has committed to fostering global partnerships and supporting Israeli startups at the forefront of AI innovation.\n\nAt their recent annual meeting in New York, JVP highlighted investment in companies in the field, including Earnix, ThetaRay, and Coro. These firms are advancing AI applications in fintech, insurtech, and climatetech, reflecting the broader trend of investors prioritizing technologies that promise significant industry disruption and growth.\n\nThetaRay is a prime example of a fintech company specializing in AI-powered analytics for financial crime detection, delivering trusted transaction monitoring and customer risk assessment solutions. Built on hyper-dimensional, multi-domain big data analytics, ThetaRay's platform operates in near-real time, offering new levels of speed and accuracy in threat detection while minimizing false positives. Its solutions empower banks, fintechs, and regulators to combat money laundering and fraud effectively, enhancing operational efficiencies and reducing compliance costs across global financial ecosystems.\n\n\"Globalization and digitalization have propelled us forward, yet they've also exposed vulnerabilities in our payment systems,\" said Peter Reynolds, CEO of ThetaRay. \"The challenge lies in discerning illicit transactions amidst the vast legitimate ones. AI emerges as our most promising solution to ensure the integrity and security of financial transactions.\"\n\nLooking forward, the future of AI in banking promises even greater advancements and widespread adoption across diverse applications. However, the journey towards AI integration is not without its hurdles. Data privacy concerns, regulatory complexities, and ethical considerations loom large as banks navigate the adoption of these powerful technologies. McKinsey advises a centralized AI operating model initially, allowing banks to build expertise, align strategies, and manage risks effectively.\n\nAs the financial industry stands on the brink of a new era driven by AI, the message from global regulators is clear: vigilance, collaboration, and proactive governance are essential to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks. This balanced approach will be crucial in ensuring that the integration of AI into banking meets the \"important prudential and financial stability challenges\" that de Cos warned of, contributing positively to financial stability and efficiency, rather than becoming a catalyst for future crises.\n\nAbout the Author", "source": {"uri": "europeanbusinessreview.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

What are the risks, and how are they being addressed? And, perhaps most importantly, how are vendors addressing the ethical and privacy concerns that come along with AI? Below are the five biggest questions security vendors are hearing -- and how to answer them.\n\nThe security industry has been using AI for years -- they've just been calling it \"analytics.\" With the volume of cameras in use today, manually monitoring them is an impossible task, which means organizations are increasingly turning to automated solutions.\n\nRoughly two years ago, deploying deep learning capabilities at the network edge became possible, effectively revolutionizing video analytics. Organizations no longer had to send raw video to the cloud or store massive amounts of footage, both of which could be prohibitively expensive. Instead, AI-based analytics could automatically detect and alert to incidents while generating metadata for further analysis.\n\nModern analytics can detect suspicious or dangerous activity with significantly greater speed and reliability than humans. By reducing the role of manual processes in security, newer systems with deep learning-enabled cameras are helping businesses improve the accuracy of their incident detection processes while also ensuring security budgets are being deployed effectively.\n\nMost companies can benefit from AI in some way. The growing accessibility of video analytics brings benefits that extend beyond security to provide insights into operational efficiency and business intelligence.\n\nFor many businesses, analyzing sales data, customer traffic, quality in production and other information can lead to insights that positively impact the bottom line. The rise of generative AI solutions has even made it easier for businesses to streamline repetitive tasks like drafting emails, responding to customer support queries and more.\n\nStill, it's important to recognize the limitations of technology. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a rush to implement thermal cameras to enable fever detection for customers visiting physical locations, but the technology simply wasn't there.\n\nAs useful as thermal cameras can be, fever detection analytics were not accurate enough to provide the desired value. As a result, people lost faith in the technology because they approached it with false expectations. When it comes to AI, it's critical to understand what you want to accomplish -- and whether it is actually possible.\n\nRegulations are steadily emerging that govern how AI can be developed and used -- and chief among them are privacy regulations. But regulation always lags behind innovation, and it can be difficult to anticipate how different compliance frameworks will approach privacy or security issues.\n\nAs a result, it's a good idea to be proactive rather than reactive, building privacy features into products from the beginning rather than waiting for regulators to provide instructions.\n\nFor video surveillance, that means implementing privacy masks to protect the identities of those being recorded, as well as cybersecurity measures that strictly monitor who has access to recorded video -- as well as the devices themselves. This will ensure the company is in a good position to comply with future privacy regulations, whatever they may be.\n\nTraining AI requires a significant amount of data, and where that data comes from is important. The debate over whether it is ethical (or even legal) to train AI on copyrighted material rages on, and inherent bias remains a significant problem in training data.\n\nOrganizations can purchase data sets to train AI models, but it isn't always easy to tell what biases that data might come with (or if it complies with regulatory guidelines). If certain video analytics struggle to differentiate between individuals of specific ethnicities or genders, that's a problem that can lead to serious ethical concerns.\n\nThese are questions that need to be answered before incorporating data into an AI training model. You can't un-bake the AI cake: Once an AI solution has been trained on tainted data, it cannot be \"untrained.\" Organizations should use their own carefully vetted data sets to train AI models rather than turning to third-party data. Using data you control is the only reliable way to address ethical concerns.\n\nMaybe! But probably not. I recently read a fascinating book titled Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. Author Yuval Noah Harari points out that Neanderthals were not only stronger than Homo Sapiens but had bigger brains as well. How, then, did humans win out?\n\nHarari posits that despite their bigger brains, Neanderthals lacked the ability to believe in abstract concepts. Humans can bond with one another over faith, beliefs, politics -- even brand loyalties. The more individualized Neanderthals were left behind as humans built cooperative societies.\n\nWhy is this relevant? Well, it's true that AI may someday be smarter than humans. In some ways, it already is. But humans have shown that we don't have to be the biggest or the smartest to retain our place at the top of the food chain. As long as we retain our curiosity, our inventiveness and our ability to collaborate, AI probably isn't going to take over the world.\n\nAs AI-based solutions are used for a growing range of security applications, questions about privacy and ethical considerations are inevitable. But when used appropriately and responsibly, AI can provide a wide range of benefits, both improving security capabilities and offering operational and intelligence advantages.\n\nAsking the right questions is important -- and so is implementing the right solutions. By taking a thoughtful and considered approach to implementing AI-based solutions, businesses can enjoy the technology's many benefits without much fear of its drawbacks.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

The first was Apple's announcement that they will voluntarily comply with President Biden's executive order on safe AI. A few days later, the European Union passed the long awaited Artificial Intelligence Act, enacting broad AI regulations. Let's take a deeper look at these announcements, and at the differences between how the US and EU are approaching the AI revolution, with all of its risks and benefits.\n\nThe Apple decision comes roughly a month after their beta release of Apple Intelligence, a new suite of AI tools that operate across the entire Apple laptop, tablet and smartphone ecosystem. Better late than never, Apple joins major tech peers Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon that previously announced voluntary compliance with last October's Executive Order. A number of the rising star AI companies, including Open AI, Anthropic and Inflection have also stated intent to comply.\n\nThe AI tools are touted to be lightweight enough to run entirely at the edge - simply meaning on the phone or laptop itself. For more complex queries, where cloud computing is needed, Apple claims that user queries are restricted only to Apple private cloud servers, and therefore user privacy and data security are safely maintained and encrypted. From their website, \"Apple Intelligence with Private Cloud Compute sets a new standard for privacy in AI, unlocking intelligence users can trust.\"\n\nBold claims. Keeping all Apple user data \"on premises\" on Apple servers does provide a level of security from the world outside Apple. But what is not so boldly claimed is that it does little to protect your data from Apple itself. For years, the big tech companies have been building suites of products for just this reason - to get all of your data onto their proprietary servers.\n\nIf Apple, for example, knows more about you than Microsoft or Google, then they can provide you better (AI customized) services, further strengthening their grip on keeping you on their platform. Have you ever tried to leave an Apple service ecosystem? It is painfully hard. AI will make customer lock-in even stronger.\n\nWhat does it mean that the tech giants are voluntarily complying with Biden's Executive Order? The truth is - it doesn't mean much. First let's consider what the EO covers.\n\n\u25cf It encourages the achievement of consensus industry standards without explicitly recommending any. It's pretty easy for industry to commit to having a seat at the table for future discussion.\n\n\u25cf It emphasizes safety, security and ethical considerations without actually proposing or defining specific regulations in these areas. Companies are getting great PR complying with empty demands.\n\n\u25cf Relies on federal agencies to establish their own standards, relevant to use cases in their respective domains. The good news is the EO gives agencies procurement and grantmaking influence to steer funds to organizations that demonstrate good behavior. Will economic incentives be enough?\n\n\u25cf Doesn't imply any explicit penalties for non-compliance, instead relying on corporate self-governance. The fox is guarding the henhouse.\n\n\u25cf Advocates for clarifying copyright and intellectual property boundaries for AI training and development without actually imposing any requirements. We trust that industry will disclose if they are creating derivative works based on proprietary content. We see artists already adding \"poison\" to their new works to catch AI malfeasance, with early indications that few organizations are behaving ethically. Whether this is deliberate or accidental as companies figure out how to sort protected from unprotected data is an open question.\n\nGenerally speaking, the US Executive Order is a starting point, simply to open a conversation that is too politically charged (even though it has nearly zero to do with politics) to take concrete action on at this time. Big companies are getting quite a bit of public-relations benefit without really committing to any behavior change, or risk of non-compliance. Everything is voluntary and nothing is required. It is little wonder to me that Apple waited until now to announce their plan to comply. It fits really well with a security-focused marketing campaign around their latest new AI product offering.\n\nThe answer is that the AI Act is significantly stronger. While there is still a long way to go, the AI Act has a number of strong initial provisions. It remains to be seen how well these will stand up to certain future legal challenges. Here are the key points of the AI Act.\n\n\u25cf Establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework across all EU member states and all market domains. This should lead to regulatory consistency, which is a hugely important benefit of the EU approach. Standardization tends to accelerate industries in a positive manner (especially for small businesses) and to reduce entry-points for special-interest lobbying. The US distributed approach across many agencies is likely to lead to highly fragmented and industry-specific future regulations (which invariably lead to loopholes).\n\n\u25cf Establishes AI risk level categories - unacceptable, high and minimal/no risk - to mitigate risks to health, safety and fundamental rights. Regulations are properly apportioned across the risk levels, creating more clarity for industry and regulators alike. High risk applications are strictly regulated.\n\n\u25cf Bans the use of remote biometric identification in public spaces. This clause clearly prioritizes public interests ahead of corporate interests. It is a major step forward in protecting individual rights and avoiding a government or corporate Surveillance State (a topic I wrote about lately, in part 1 and part 2 and part 3).\n\n\u25cf Establishes a clear legal framework, with heavy penalties for non-compliance. Unlike the US approach, the EU is dictating terms industry. In the US, we are letting companies lead the way and trusting them to behave.\n\n\u25cf Requires companies to fully disclose all protected works and data used in AI training. This opens the door to legal dispute and financial penalties for unauthorized use of copyrighted material.\n\n\u25cf Emphasize the importance of continuous and rigorous testing, both before and after AI is deployed.\n\n\u25cf Clear understanding of the need for \"security by design\" in all cybersystems. Cybersecurity must be integrated with AI from the start.\n\nIn a nutshell, the EU continues to be the global leader in protecting consumer privacy. The culture set by the General Data Protection Rights Act back in 2016 (and fully enforceable by 2018) is continued and expanded in the new Artificial Intelligence Act.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US we are giving free reign to companies to self-police themselves. This is great for large tech companies that have outsized influence (lobbying) over future regulations, tailored to their own products and preferences. This puts smaller companies at risk, building tools that they can only hope will survive a fragmented regulatory landscape.\n\nIn the absence of federal regulation I expect we will see individual states create their own state-by-state regulations to fill an obvious regulatory gap. This makes it complicated for small companies to develop new products that are consistent wherever they are used. A large company may be able to withstand an occasional legal challenge across the US.

It will automate tasks previously carried out by humans and provide increased efficiency and accuracy. It will also be able to analyse large volumes of data and provide quick answers, much faster than humans can.\n\nOther people fear AI's lack of empathy and creativity. They foresee ethical challenges and are concerned about data protection. It is also feared that it will lead to high unemployment and challenging changes in society.\n\nIf we are to take all of these predictions about AI seriously, then the opportunities and impacts must be investigated.\n\nAs part of the teaching at the Department of Design and the Department of Manufacturing and Civil Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Gj\u00f8vik, we have studied how AI affects the creativity of the students we teach. A sample of 208 students divided into 37 groups was studied.\n\nAccuracy is absolutely essential in many of the subjects we teach. The students must understand that every detail in products and innovation solutions matters.\n\nA strength of AI is that it helps students come up with many ideas in the ideation phase of project assignments. Some suggestions from AI can be verging on the ridiculous, but it is precisely this deviation from strict accuracy that helps expand the creative boundaries for students and teachers.\n\nFor example, many students use ChatGPT. By recognising the content of questions posed by students, ChatGPT can retrieve relevant information that might otherwise take the students a very long time to find, if they could find such answers at all.\n\nIn design studies, this can provide significant benefits if used carefully and strategically. We observed this in a study conducted among students who took design courses. The students were given the task of experimenting with ChatGPT during the initial brainstorming phase of a project assignment. The teachers then analysed the students' reflections and examined their reports.\n\nWe compared their answers with those from the previous year where ChatGPT was not used.\n\nThe goal was to find out if AI could provide useful insights that could be used further in the students' work.\n\nThe results showed a marginal but significant improvement in overall report quality and other quality dimensions. The change was small in size or scope, but still important or meaningful for the students' work.\n\nWe also used AI in a design process. The students were tasked with building a prototype of their product proposals. The goal was to find out if AI could provide useful insights that could be used further in the students' work.\n\nThey had to document the results of what was created by AI and assess the extent to which this had affected the final product. The students therefore had to be particularly critical to elements that had been digitally visualised by AI.\n\nThe result was a significant improvement in the quality of the visualisations. To some extent, AI introduced new and useful ideas that students could elaborate on.\n\nThe students did not simply become passive recipients of AI's benefits. They were critically engaged and reflected on the consequences of using this type of technology. This was especially evident in their discussions about how AI affects education and learning.\n\nThe students were of the opinion that effective use of tools like ChatGPT requires a deeper understanding of the underlying technology.\n\nInstead of a simple debate about whether AI should be allowed in classrooms or not, they discussed how AI could be used responsibly and effectively.\n\nIn short, we found the students had a mature approach to new technological tools.\n\nThe students were of the opinion that effective use of tools like ChatGPT requires a deeper understanding of the underlying technology. This is key.\n\nThe students' digital judgement is being developed.

In today's world, AI-powered tools have the ability to enhance productivity, automate mundane tasks and enable more innovative code creation - all of which point towards AI being an indispensable secret weapon in a developer's toolkit.\n\nDespite this, developers remain pervasive in their scepticism, particularly regarding their trust in AI tools' output. This division between AI's transformative potential and developers' cautious trust in its capabilities forms the crux of the evolving relationship between coders and their AI assistants.\n\nAI tool usage in the UK is far below the global average\n\nThe developer community's use of GenAI tools is growing, and their experiences are largely favourable. Our 2024 Developer Survey -- which deep-dives into the sentiments and preferences of over 65,000 global developers, 3,200 of whom are based in the UK -- found that the majority of respondents (76% of developers worldwide) are using AI tools in their development processes or plan to do so in the future.\n\nJust over half (51%) of UK respondents in this year's survey highlighted they are using AI tools somewhere in their development process, significantly up on last year's figure (37%) -- albeit far below the global average of 62%. Nonetheless, developers who are using the tools are generally happy with them. 62% of those surveyed in the UK see AI tools as very favourable or favourable tools for their workflow, just below the global average (72%).\n\nHowever, 29% claimed to be 'indifferent' towards using AI tools as part of their development workflows, while 1 in 10 (10%) take a 'completely unfavourable' stance - making the UK one of the least favourable countries to AI in Europe along with Poland (59%) and Germany (60%). A further 36% of UK developers even stated that they are not currently using AI in their development process and do not intend to do so. Which, of course, begs the question - why?\n\nUK developers split on the trustworthiness of AI tools\n\nDevelopers may view AI tools sceptically due to concerns over reliability and integration challenges. 68% of UK developers cite a lack of trust in output, and 65% of UK developers cite a lack of codebase context as a top challenge with AI at work. These tools, while promising, often come with a steep learning curve and unpredictable results, making them more of a hindrance than a help in a high-stakes development environment.\n\nAdditionally, developers may feel that the opacity of AI decision-making processes undermines their control over project outcomes, leading to a preference for more transparent and manageable development tools. This combination of factors may contribute to a cautious stance towards AI, emphasising the need for solutions that better align with developers' practical needs and preferences.\n\nInterestingly, UK developers are split on the trustworthiness of the output from AI tools. The Developer Survey found that UK respondents deem the accuracy of AI tools as more untrustworthy (40%) than trustworthy (38%), with a further 22% taking a neutral stance.\n\nUK leads the way with salaries\n\nDevelopers in the UK may not place the greatest trust in GenAI tools, but their employers trust them a great deal - and aren't afraid to put their money where their mouth is. UK median salary of every single job role listed in this year's survey is higher than that of the EMEA average with Engineering Manager ($142,000 per annum), Blockchain Developers ($137,000 per annum) and Site Reliability Engineer ($127,000 per annum) the most lucrative roles.\n\nThis is also reflected across the board among individual coding languages. Developers using OCaml, Scala, Solidity, and Erlang top the list for commanding the highest salaries in the UK, with all of those listed in this year's survey achieving higher averages than the EMEA median salary. This highlights that code development remains rewarding in the UK.\n\nHumans + AI\n\nAlmost 40% of UK developers are still not fully sold on using AI tools for work - and trust and quality play a role in this. As Generative AI and LLMs continue to advance, the foundations of vetted, trusted, and accurate data will be central to how technology solutions are built. At the end of the day, content development is human-driven. GenAI can only respond with what has already been published - it won't provide any data or insightful feedback on anything created after its last data ingestion.\n\nHumans provide up-to-date information, identify patterns early on, and add signals around the social value of knowledge within a community, providing context to the content. While AI tools play a valuable role in coding, the value of the human community should not be underestimated.\n\nErin Yepis, Senior Analyst, Market Research and Insights Stack Overflow.", "source": {"uri": "silicon.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Silicon UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Codebase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated development environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Learning curve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OCaml"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erlang (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stack Overflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scala (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market research"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Methodologies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Methodologies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/AutoCAD", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/AutoCAD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.silicon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Erin-Yepis-headshot-185x185.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

We want technology to boost growth and deliver change right across the board, and I'm confident projects like these will help us realise that ambition.\"\n\nThe funding announcement comes as the previous Tory government's pledges to fund AI projects are being pulled. According to a report on the BBC, DSIT has shelved \u00a31.3bn of funding promised by the Conservatives for technology and AI projects. DSIT told the BBC the money was promised by the previous administration but was never allocated in its budget. Projects impacted include the \u00a3800m exascale computer in Edinburgh.\n\nOne of the companies benefiting from Labour's AI funding commitment is V-Lab, which has received \u00a3165,006 to continue its development of software powered by AI to help people train in the construction sector. Training is provided through immersive, scenario-based, virtual simulations of real construction sites to teach workers about risk assessments and safety protocols.\n\nAnother firm to benefit is Nottingham-based Anteam, which is working alongside retailers and the NHS to improve the efficiency of pharmacy deliveries using AI algorithms. The technology matches the delivery needs of retailers and hospitals to existing delivery journeys, which offers a way to make use of under-utilised capacity, cutting carbon emissions and delivering a better experience for patients.\n\nAlso receiving funding is Hack Partners, which is the lead developer of an entirely autonomous system to monitor, manage and identify defects on rail infrastructure across the country.\n\nAnd Cambridge-based Monumo is part of a team awarded \u00a3750,152 to develop improved designs for motors in electric vehicles. Its 3D generative AI tool is set to improve sustainability across sectors spanning commercial transportation, flight and power generation.\n\nOther companies that will receive funding include Robok Limited with its SeeGul AI tool, which uses AI to monitor efficiency, improve resourcing and identify bottlenecks in warehouses and storage facilities, and Kelp Technologies, which is working with fashion retailers including Selfridges to develop real-time pricing and market trend analysis to address the complexity of pricing second-hand apparel.\n\nDSIT said the funding is specifically to support applications in high-growth industries to ensure AI is at the heart of driving greater productivity and efficiency across key areas of the economy.\n\nKedar Pandya, UKRI Technology Missions Fund senior responsible owner and executive director of cross-council programmes at UKRI's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: \"These projects will drive AI innovation and economic growth in a diverse range of high-growth industry sectors in all nations of the UK. They complement other investments made through the UKRI Technology Missions Fund, which are already helping to boost growth and productivity across the UK by harnessing the power of AI and other transformative technologies.\"", "source": {"uri": "computerweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computer Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Science,_Innovation_and_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department for Science, Innovation and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feryal_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feryal Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exascale_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exascale computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Research_and_Innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UK Research and Innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_and_Physical_Sciences_Research_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfridges", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfridges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Inventions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Inventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/HeroImages/London-Westminster-Houses-of-Parliament-Daniel-adobe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

After removing duplicate references, a total of 5560 studies remained. Figure 1 presents an overview of the literature search, screening, and selection process. During the initial screening, I manually reviewed titles and abstracts. In this step, I excluded 5501 records, which did not meet the inclusion criteria outlined in Methods section. I assessed the full texts of the remaining 59 records for eligibility and I checked their reference lists for other potentially relevant studies. After the full-text screening, I excluded 44 records. Most studies were excluded because they did not perform any scale validation, e.g. or did not touch upon the concept of AI literacy. AI4KGA scale was excluded because the author did not provide the full item list and did not respond to my request for it, making it questionable whether the scale can be used by anyone else. While self-efficacy is somewhat a distinct construct from self-reported AI literacy, the distinction between the two is heavily blurred. I therefore decided to adopt a more inclusive approach when assessing the relevancy of the measured constructs and included Morales-Garc\u00eda et al.'s GSE-6AI and Wang & Chuang's AI self-efficacy scale as well. I added one publication from the reference lists of the included studies to the final selection and six studies from the reverse searches, yielding a total of 22 studies validating or revalidating 16 scales.\n\nTable 1 presents the studies' basic descriptions. The included scales share several characteristics. Only a minority of the scales are performance-based, with most scales relying on self-assessment-based Likert items. Most scales have multiple factor structures. Constructing AI literacy scales has started only recently as all scales were constructed in the last three years, with the oldest being MAIRS-MS from 2021. MAIRS-MS, SNAIL, and AILS are also the only scales to this date, which have been revalidated by another study. On the other hand, the scales vary by their target populations. Most of them target general population or higher education students, with three of them targeting secondary education students, and one targeting teachers.\n\nWhile the authors of the scales drew their conceptualizations of AI literacy from different sources and their scales target different populations, they largely overlap with core competencies comprising AI literacy. By looking at the authors' conceptualizations of key competencies comprising AI literacy, virtually all scales recognize several core competencies as fundamental to AI literacy. First, they emphasize the technical understanding of AI, distinguishing it from mere general awareness about the technology. Secondly, they consider the societal impact of AI as a critical component. Lastly, AI ethics is acknowledged as an essential aspect. These competencies collectively form the foundational elements of AI literacy, and they are consistently present as factors across the various scales. There is a consensus among the authors of the scales about the three competencies being essential for both secondary and higher education students as well as general population and medical professionals. On the other hand, the authors of the scales differ in perceiving higher-order AI-related skills -- creation and evaluation of AI -- as components of AI literacy. In the original Ng et al.'s conceptualization, creation and evaluation of AI are core components of AI literacy. MAILS drawing from the Ng et al.'s conceptualization identified creation of AI as a related, but separate construct from AI literacy. AILQ, on the other hand, drawing from the same conceptualization includes creating AI as a core part of AI literacy. Several other scales also consider the ability to critically evaluate AI as a core part of AI literacy. Considering the widespread integration of AI into daily and professional life, a question arises, whether the skills to create and critically evaluate AI will not have to be included as core competencies of AI literacy in near future, as those competencies might be crucial for functional AI literacy.\n\nI assessed the quality of the scales based on the COSMIN measurement properties and additionally on interpretability and feasibility. The Methods section provides a detailed explanation of these individual properties. Table 2 shows quality assessment of the scales based on the COSMIN and GRADE criteria. Overall, the scales demonstrated good structural validity and internal consistency. On the other hand, only a few have been tested for content validity, reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness. None of the scales have been tested for cross-cultural validity and measurement error. Most studies did not report any interpretability indicators and almost none reported scales' average completion time (Tables 3 and 4).\n\nThis is a performance-based scale assessing AI-related knowledge through 30 multiple-choice questions, each with a single correct option, and includes one sorting question. The authors used item response theory (IRT) models to confirm the scale's single-factor structure. The authors drew from Long & Magerko's conceptualization of AI literacy, which works with a set of 17 AI competencies grouped into five overarching areas: What is AI?, What can AI do?, How does AI work?, How should AI be used?, and How do people perceive AI?. The authors developed the scale primarily for higher-education students -- the scale comprises both items which could be considered specialized advanced knowledge (e.g., distinguishing between supervised and unsupervised learning), but also basic general knowledge (e.g., recognizing areas of daily life where AI is used). However, the scale is arguably also suitable for any professionals who encounter AI in their work. There is some limited evidence for the scale's content validity and high evidence for the scale's structural validity, internal consistency, and construct validity. It is currently available in German and English, although English version has not yet been revalidated. It is possible that the content of some questions -- especially those dealing with a typical use of AI in practice -- will need to be changed in the future due to developments in AI, rendering some of the present items obsolete.\n\nAI-CI is a performance-based concept inventory scale for middle school students assessing AI-related knowledge through 20 multiple-choice questions. The authors used their own AI literacy curriculum to design the scale's content. IRT was used for validation. There is good evidence for the scale's content validity and structural validity, and high evidence for the scale's internal consistency and responsiveness. It is currently available in English. The content of the items appears to be more general and less dependent on the context of AI developments compared to the AI literacy test.\n\nAILQ is aimed at secondary education students. The scale employs authors' conceptualization of cognitive domains of AI literacy stemming from their exploratory review adding affective, behavioural, and ethical learning domains. The authors employed a CFA which resulted in identification of the scale's four-factor structure paralleling the four learning domains. There is moderate positive evidence for the scale's content validity, high positive evidence for the scale's structural validity and internal consistency, and very low positive evidence for the scale's responsiveness. It is currently available in English.\n\nAILS scale targets general population in the context of human-AI interaction (HAII). The authors drew from their own conceptualization of AI literacy grounded in their literature review resulting in four constructs of AI literacy: awareness, use, evaluation, and ethics. The four constructs are parallel to the scale's four factors confirmed by a CFA. The scale has since been revalidated in Turkish language, however, no direct cross-cultural validation has been performed. There is very low positive evidence for the scale's content validity, high positive evidence for the scale's structural validity and internal consistency, low evidence for reliability, and high positive evidence for construct validity.\n\nAISES is aimed at assessing AI self-efficacy of general population. The scale's conceptualization is grounded in previous technology-related self-efficacy research. A CFA confirmed the scale's four-factor structure. There is high positive evidence for the scale's structural validity and internal consistency, however, content validation on the target population was not performed. It is currently available in English.\n\nThis subscale is part of a larger instrument aimed at assessing perceptions of generative AI of university students. Here, I reviewed only the subscale dealing with the self-perceived AI literacy. The authors drew from their own conceptualization of AI literacy grounded in their literature review. The items revolve around generative AI's limitations and potential biases. CFA confirmed the subscale's single-factor structure. There is high positive evidence for the subscale's structural validity and internal consistency, however, content validation of the scale is disputable. It is currently available in English.\n\nThe scale for college students is focused specifically on assessing AI literacy using ChatGPT. The scale is grounded in a Delphi survey performed by the authors. There is good evidence for the scale's content validity and high evidence for the scale's structural validity, internal consistency, and construct validity. The scale is available in English language.\n\nThe scale comprises only six items, making it suitable for a rapid assessment of AI self-efficacy. There is high positive evidence for the scale's structural validity, internal consistency, and measurement invariance by gender, however, content validation on the target population was not performed. It is currently available in Spanish and English.\n\nThis scale targets higher education students and the authors also largely drew from Long & Magerko's conceptualization of AI literacy. The authors employed a CFA which resulted in identification of the scale's four-factor structure. There is high positive evidence for the scale's structural validity and internal consistency, however, content validation on the target population was not performed. It is currently available in English.\n\nIntelligent-TPACK aims to assess teachers' self-perceived level of AI-related knowledge necessary for integration of AI in their pedagogical work. It draws from the TPACK framework adding an aspect of AI ethics. The scale assesses teachers' knowledge of four AII-based tools: Chatbots, intelligent tutoring systems, dashboards, and automated assessment systems arguing that those are the most prevalent AI-based technologies in K-12 education. A CFA showed scale's five-factor structure comprising the original TPACK dimensions with ethics. There is high positive evidence for the scale's structural validity and internal consistency, however, content validation on the target population was not performed. It is currently available in English.\n\nThis scale targets secondary education students. The authors drew from an ad hoc expert group's conceptualization of AI literacy revolving around AI's societal impact, understanding of AI, AI execution plans, problem solving, data literacy, and ethics. The authors employed a CFA which resulted in identification of the scale's six-factor structure. There is some limited positive evidence for the scale's content validity and high evidence for the scale's structural validity, internal consistency, and construct validity. So far, the scale is only available in Korean.\n\nMAILS is a general-population scale developed from Ng et al.'s conceptualization of AI literacy with four areas: know and understand AI, use and apply AI, evaluate and create AI, and AI Ethics. Additionally, it includes further psychological competencies related to the use of AI above the Ng et al.'s areas of AI Literacy -- self-efficacy and self-perceived competency. It is the most extensive instruments out of the reviewed instruments. Resulting from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the four AI literacy areas were not found to be all part of a single AI literacy concept -- creating AI was found to be a separate factor. The authors made the scale modular in a sense that each of the resulting factors can be measured independently of each other -- AI literacy (18 items), create AI (4 items), AI self-efficacy (6 items), and AI self-competency (6 items). There is high positive evidence for the scale's structural validity, internal consistency, and construct validity, however, content validation on the target population was not performed. It is currently available in German and English, although English version has not yet been revalidated. There is evidence that the scale has good interpretability, although the scale shows some indication of floor effects for five items and ceiling effect for one item. The scale is feasible for a quick assessment of AI literacy, with most participants completing the scale within 20\u2009min.\n\nMAIRS-MS is aimed at medical students and the authors developed it from conceptualization of AI readiness of both professionals and medical students. Originally developed for Turkish medical students, the scale has since been revalidated in Persian language in Iran, however, no direct cross-cultural validation has been performed. CFAs on two samples confirmed the scale's four-factor structure. There is some limited positive evidence for the scale's content validity and high evidence for the scale's structural validity, internal consistency, and invariance by gender.\n\nThis scale targets general population. The authors draw from their own conceptualization of AI literacy grounded in their literature review. The authors employed a structural equation model to come to the scale's five-factor structure. Due to a limited sample size, there is only limited positive evidence for the scale's content and structural validity, and medium evidence for internal consistency. It is currently available in English.\n\nSAIL4ALL is a general-population scale comprising four distinct subscales, which can be used independently. However, the individual subscales cannot be aggregated to get an overall AI literacy score. The scale can also be used in both true/false and Likert-scale format. The authors drew from Long & Magerko's conceptualization of AI literacy. Content validation on the target population was not performed. There is mixed evidence for the scale's structural validity and internal consistency. On the one hand, a two-factor \"What is AI?\" subscale, a single-factor \"How does AI work?\", and a single-factor \"How should AI be used?\" show good structural validity and internal consistency in both true/false and Likert scale format. On the other hand, \"What can AI do?\" subscale shows poor structural validity and internal consistency. There is an indication that the scale suffers from the ceiling effect.\n\nSNAIL is a general-population scale developed from the authors' extensive Delphi expert study's conceptualization of AI literacy. The authors used an exploratory factor analysis to assess the scale's factor structure resulting in a three-factor TUCAPA model of AI literacy -- technical understanding, critical appraisal, and practical application. The scale has since been revalidated in Turkish language and in German language and for the use of learning gains using retrospective-post-assessment, however, no direct cross-cultural validation has been performed. There is high positive evidence for the scale's structural validity and internal consistency, and due to a small longitudinal sample size, only limited evidence for the scale's reliability and responsiveness. Content validation on the target population was not performed in any of the four studies, nor in the Delphi study.

This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) steps into play. It has the potential to revolutionise content creation by adapting it to each individual's unique requirements and interests. It is also revolutionising many diverse industries, and music streaming is no exception. While AI is changing the way people listen to audio, it is also enhancing the sound quality of their beloved films. This combination of existing AI algorithms and audio innovation improves sound quality while also creating personalised acoustic configurations.\n\nBusinesses are being transformed by utilising AI and machine learning technologies in their processes. As per a McKinsey report, around 70% of companies will adopt at least one AI technology in their operations by the year 2030. This growth will solely be accelerated by the promise of AI that it will augment and complement human capabilities.\n\nToday, various leading streaming music platforms depend largely on AI algorithms to assess users' interests and provide personalised playlists and suggestions. These systems leverage advanced AI algorithms to sift through enormous music collections and user activity data, ultimately allowing highly customised user experiences.\n\nMoreover, the technological mechanisms driving these AI-powered music recommendation systems are interesting. They predict user preferences by analysing patterns in user behaviour, song textual context, and music auditory features. For instance, Collaborative Filtering, leverages user activity patterns to suggest tracks that similar users have listened to. On the other hand, Natural Language Processing (NLP), analyses lyrics and other textual data to better comprehend song context. Additionally, Auditory Modelling entails an examination of the song's real auditory characteristics. These algorithms function both individually and collectively to provide extremely accurate and customised suggestions.\n\nAI and machine learning are transforming how audio streaming services comprehend customer preferences and provide content. In addition, with the inclusion of these technologies, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) have considerably improved.\n\nBesides improving content distribution, AI technologies are extensively used in the content production process for music streaming companies. The automated mastering services analyse and improve the audio quality of the tracks by using artificial intelligence algorithms. This includes regulating levels, adjusting equalisation, and compressing to offer an uninterrupted listening experience across several devices and sound systems.\n\nFurthermore, AI not only improves but also creates sounds. AI-composed music tracks are becoming a reality, with algorithms capable of creating unique melodies, harmonies, and rhythms for a variety of genres and moods. This offers new possibilities for music streaming services, allowing them to provide subscribers with exclusive, AI-generated material. Numerous music streaming services use AI to curate creative material such as theme-based playlists and mood-specific listening experiences. For example, you may create a \"Chill Out\" playlist with tunes with slow tempos and relaxing harmonies, and a \"Workout\" playlist with lively, energetic tracks. This degree of personalisation elevates the music streaming experience by adapting it to the user's current mood or activities.\n\nIn recent years, AI has become a significant tool for organisations seeking to develop personalised content that connects with their target audience. Businesses may use multiple AI tools such as natural language processing and recommendation engines to develop more effective and interesting audio content that increases customer engagement and revenue.\n\nWhile moving forward, future developments in AI and machine learning technology will offer more features, improved personalisation approaches, and novel content distribution ways for music streaming services. Presently, AI has the potential to accelerate cross-platform integrations and partnerships in the music business. By utilising it, music streaming platforms may deliver a more integrated and personalised listening experience by connecting to social networking platforms, fitness applications, and other digital services.\n\nAnother potential future for music platforms is the development of entirely new media formats that combine conventional storytelling concepts with immersive and interactive experiences. This might provide new chances for businesses to interact with audiences in novel ways. Thus, AI will be able to benefit the whole audio generation, distribution, and consumption ecosystem.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playlist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filter (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Content delivery network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acoustics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mastering (audio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collaborative filtering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_streaming_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music streaming service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_reinforcement_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sound reinforcement system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Music_and_Audio", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Music and Audio", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Telephony", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/06/1600x900/_f7f69196-740b-11ea-bbaf-88371e4f22eb_1722922226774.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Subliminal techniques\n\nAI Systems which operate beyond a person's consciousness, and which may include manipulative or deceptive techniques which could distort a person's decision making in a way which is reasonably likely to cause significant harm.\n\n2. Exploiting human vulnerabilities\n\nWhere AI Systems exploit the vulnerabilities of a specific group of persons due to certain characteristics in order to materially distort their behaviour in a way which is reasonably likely to cause significant harm.\n\n3. Social scoring\n\nThe deployment of AI to gauge the trustworthiness of natural persons over a period of time based on their social behaviour or known, or predicted personal or personality characteristics where such social scoring has a detrimental effect on the treatment of certain natural persons in contexts which are different to where source data was collected, or where such social scoring has a detrimental effect on the treatment of certain natural persons which is disproportionate to the nature of the source social data.\n\n4. AI System use in Criminality Risk Assessments\n\nThis involves AI Systems making risk assessments of natural persons in order to predict criminality.\n\n5. Facial recognition databases\n\nUsing AI Systems to create or expand facial recognition databases though untargeted scraping of facial images from internet or CCTV.\n\n6. Emotional inference generation in workplace and education setting\n\nUse of AI systems to infer emotions of a natural person in the areas of workplace and education institutions.\n\nIn line items 1 and 2 above, the wording \"significant harm\" is clearly a higher threshold than mere \"harm\".

The findings confirm that consumers are embracing the personalized sales experience AI offers, but still highly value human-to-human connection and empathy in their interactions.\n\nThe Shift from Service to Sales\n\nRespondents ranked customized sales offers as the number one positive impact of AI on customer service experience. This technology benefit was ranked higher than resolving issues/queries faster (second) and widening support windows (third). Moreover, over half (53%) of respondents welcome an agent using AI to suggest relevant upgrades or deals tailored to their needs and purchase history. Notably, Millennials (62%) were the most receptive demographic to this offering. Overall, more than half (54%) of respondents feel AI is more helpful than harmful in customer service interactions.\n\n\"This data confirms a growing trend Cogito is seeing in the contact center to boost revenue growth. Organizations are evolving from purely resolving service issues, to taking the opportunity to present new offers during a customer service experience,\" said Josh Feast, CEO and co-founder, Cogito. \"AI ushers this movement forward by helping identify the right proposal to make based on the customer's personalized history and needs, while simultaneously enhancing the agent's capabilities by recommending the best moment and language to seamlessly integrate into the service experience.\"\n\nThe Value of Human Connection\n\nThe future of contact centers lies in the synergy between human expertise and AI capabilities. While AI offers many advantages, much of its potential lies in supporting agents, not taking their place. Notably, over 3-in-4 (77%) respondents would prefer interacting with a human agent who uses AI tools in the background instead of using self-service options like chatbots.\n\nAdditional findings include:\n\nRespondents ranked lost human-to-human connection as the number one negative impact of AI on customer service experiences, next to lack of empathy and fear over human job loss.Over 1-in-3 (39%) respondents consider AI-driven customer service (e.g., chatbots) much or slightly worse than human customer service (e.g., phone call).However, nearly half (47%) of respondents are comfortable with a customer service agent leveraging AI in the background to automate their tasks.37% of respondents are only slightly concerned about human job loss in certain industries or roles but overall, believe AI will best work as a tool, not a replacement.\n\nThe Quality Gen Z Favors Most\n\nA generational divide is emerging when it comes to AI's role in customer service, with Gen Z valuing human empathy more than older generations like Boomers. Over 1-in-3 (38%) of Gen Z respondents consider lack of empathy to be the most negative impact of AI on customer service experiences, in comparison to only 23% of Boomers.\n\nFurther insights reveal:\n\nOver a quarter (27%) of Gen Z respondents are comfortable with a customer service agent leveraging AI in the background to better understand emotional intelligence to provide empathy and deepen connections, in comparison to only 8% of Boomers.20% of Gen Z respondents aren't concerned about human job loss as they believe AI will never be able to replace human connection and empathy, in comparison to just 12% of Boomers agreeing.\n\nCogito integrates the nuances of Emotion AI, the precision of Conversation AI, and the expertise of Generative AI. By analyzing vocal, lexical, and behavioral cues during a conversation, Cogito's AI equips agents with real-time guidance and support, enabling them to effectively serve customers. This approach allows agents to maintain the human-to-human connection and empathy that customers value in service and sales interactions.\n\nTo learn more about Cogito and its impact on service-to-sales in the contact center, click here.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe online survey, which was completed by 1,000 18+ U.S. adults, was commissioned by Cogito and fielded by Dynata, a global market research firm, in July 2024.\n\nAbout Cogito\n\nCogito innovates with emotion and conversation AI to deliver real-time coaching and guidance to contact centers and frontline teams.

This raises some serious concerns regarding user privacy and the possible misuse of such collected data. For mitigating the associated risks, it is important for manufacturers to implement stringent security measures with respect to user data and always obtain explicit user consent for collecting and using the same.\n\nAI Bias: Since AI algorithms are trained by existing datasets, it tends to foster or contain biases contained in the data itself. This could produce multiple instances of discrimination, such as in hiring or search results. Developers must thus be aware of any possible bias that may already be contained in the training data and find ways to minimize these effects.\n\nJob Displacement: With AI automating an ever-increasing proportion of tasks comes an element of job displacement in some sectors. While, without doubt, AI will most probably create new job opportunities in many areas, a lot of workforce retraining programs will also be required to help people adapt to the changing nature of jobs.\n\nDigital Divide: While the affordability of AI-powered laptops below \u20b91 lakh rupees is a step in the right direction, the actual bridging of the digital divide -- where each and every citizen gets equal access to such devices and requisite digital literacy -- remains, to a large extent, a task yet to be achieved.\n\nControl of Artificial Intelligence: More and more capabilities are being added into AI, leaving some people concerned that the tendency will be for it to get too powerful and eventually beyond human control.

'Human-In-The-Loop' Design", "body": "After a recent presentation, a technology leader in the U.K. asked me: Since we use AI in so many of our processes at Workato, how do we control it? It's a fair question. The top concern many have when using AI is inaccuracy, according to McKinsey research.\n\nMy answer: human-in-the-loop design.\n\nFor many in the tech industry, it's clear that generative AI is transformative. However, the current large language models (LLMs) are an intermediate step to that transformation. To make it work in the meantime, human-in-the-loop design is emerging as a popular trend to both deploy AI in the real world today and deliver some of the most effective AI-powered business processes.\n\nI've noticed several high-profile examples of AI processes that would likely have benefited from a human in the loop. For example, Air Canada was recently found to be financially responsible after its chatbot mistakenly provided a discount that went against official company policy. Mcdonald's canned its drive-thru AI for serving up bacon on ice cream and placing hundred-dollar McNugget orders.\n\nI think there would likely be many more examples if businesses weren't too nervous to actually release and scale these systems in the real world. Using LLMs alone, many still struggle to prevent inaccurate or misleading outputs. As a result, projects remain confined to the experimentation stage. That's preventing organizations from getting the full value from their AI investments.\n\nAlready, AI can immediately improve some common tasks without the need for human-in-the-loop design. The technology excels at summarizing huge amounts of information, which is helping professionals in all roles get more immediate access to intelligence. But eventually, LLMs will become so intelligent that they will begin to function as \"digital brains\" across the enterprise. They'll replicate human capabilities and drive new levels of automation.\n\nMany businesses are years away from that capability, but they can start to work toward that goal by introducing AI at a greater velocity -- and keeping humans involved at critical junctures in the process.\n\nRecent research by MIT and Accenture shows that, when nudged to review LLM-generated outputs, humans are more likely to discover and fix errors.\n\nIn the study, participants were broken down into three groups. Each received the same ChatGPT-generated passages but were provided different levels of insights into what was correct, incorrect or missing from the output. The researchers also included unlabeled inaccuracies throughout the results provided to everyone to further test the ability of users to evaluate AI-generated content.\n\nThose who were given no details about the accuracy or sourcing of the information -- the typical experience for most commercial LLM users today -- were more likely to overlook mistakes or inaccuracies compared to those provided with error labeling. What this suggests is that, when given the chance to evaluate results from AI systems, users can greatly improve the quality of the outputs. The more information provided about the origins and accuracy of the results, the better the users are at detecting problems.\n\nThis is why human-in-the-loop design is so powerful. It's already common in many processes, like financial reporting. Increasingly, companies are using AI to generate results quickly after the close of each quarter. But no business is simply going to paste the exact output into their regulatory statements. Instead, there will be several rounds of reviews to identify any errors.\n\nThe author of the research, Dr. Ren\u00e9e Richardson Gosline, often speaks of the value of adding speed bumps between AI output and delivery, what she refers to as \"beneficial friction.\"\n\nIn some cases, speed bumps are just the smarter strategy. One of our favorite recent examples of humans in the loop that we have done at Workato is a process that automatically identifies lost sales opportunities and drafts a \"reactivation\" email to the related contact.\n\nThe salesperson receives a notification in Slack with an AI-generated email for them to review, edit and approve. Once it is approved, the email is sent via Outreach on their behalf. To our sales team, this feels like magic. It is automating important but non-urgent work that doesn't always get done.\n\nIn reality, it is an orchestration between the CRM (Salesforce), collaboration tool (Slack), sales engagement platform (Outreach) and an LLM (GPT4 by OpenAI). The speed bump -- the human interaction -- ensures that an email isn't automatically deployed without valuable context only gained through years of experience and personal relationships with the clients.\n\nTo get to that level of AI maturity, companies must start thinking about humans as a key ingredient in orchestrating their AI-enabled processes. Then, they can weave together people, systems, processes and AI to enhance productivity and efficiency.\n\nAs workers begin to interact with new AI applications, mistakes are bound to happen. That's inevitable with new technology, especially one as powerful and complex as AI. But unlike in the past, when it could take years for software issues to get resolved, the immediate feedback that employees provide will be critical in helping to enhance the performance of the systems to reduce errors in the future. Feedback can be as simple as a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button. The feedback will make your LLMs smarter, leading to more intelligent processes over time.\n\nThis will be a game-changer for organizations. Improved models will encourage greater usage, increasing the amount of feedback the systems get and further enhancing performance. It's this cycle that will help companies reap the real benefits of more intelligent enterprises. And it all starts with human-in-the-loop design today.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

It comes as the Act, on which we've previously commented here, was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 12 July and came into force on 1 August 2024.\n\nUnder the Act, the job of monitoring AI systems and ensuring that products on the market conform with the Act's requirements will fall to national market surveillance authorities (\"MSAs\"). MSAs will be required to report annually to the Commission and relevant competition authorities about \"any information identified in the course of market surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the application of Union law on competition rules. They shall also annually report to the Commission about the use of prohibited practices that occurred during that year and about the measures taken\".\n\nIt is for Member States to designate an appropriate MSA which \"shall exercise their powers independently, impartially and without bias so as to safeguard the objectivity of their activities and tasks, and to ensure the application and implementation of this Regulation. The members of those authorities shall refrain from any action incompatible with their duties. Provided that those principles are observed, such activities and tasks may be performed by one or more designated authorities, in accordance with the organisational needs of the Member State.\"\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the EDPB has recommended that existing national data protection authorities (\"DPAs\") be designated as MSAs in a number of areas for the purposes of the Act. The EDPB notes that DPAs already have considerable experience and expertise in dealing with the impact of AI on data security and computing, and in assessing the risks to fundamental rights posed by new technologies. It argues that \"the processing of personal data (which is often strictly intertwined with non-personal data) along the lifecycle of AI systems \u2012 and particularly along the lifecycle of those AI systems presenting a high risk to fundamental rights \u2012 clearly is (and will continue to be) a core element of the various technologies covered under the umbrella of the AI definition, as enshrined in Article 3(1) AI Act\".\n\nIn addition to the experience and expertise of DPAs, the EDPB also points to the advantages from the perspective of supervision and coordination, arguing that \"the designation of DPAs as MSAs would benefit all stakeholders in the AI value chain by making available a single contact point, facilitating the interactions between different regulatory bodies that are concerned by both the AI Act and EU data protection law\". There is also the added benefit, the EDPB argues, that DPAs are already fully independent, meaning that they can provide effective independent scrutiny of AI systems, as required under the Act.\n\nSummarising its position, the EDPB has recommended the following:", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Protection_Board", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Data Protection Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Journal_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official Journal of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Objectivity (philosophy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Value chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 306, "textEnd": 313}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Rouge Artificial Intelligence (RAI) must be classified as a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) by the United Nations through a declaration, to pave the way for stringent protocol on the safe development of AI.\n\nWMDs are presently recognized by treaties as weapons which are nuclear, chemical, and biological in nature. This ignores the reality that AI, regardless of which state develops it and for what purpose, may go rogue and end up utilizing the arsenal of presently defined WMD against any state.\n\nThe concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD), which keeps nuclear armed states from engaging in first strike against one another, does not apply to an AI, as the latter may not be bound by human loyalty of state or the preservation of physical life. In other words, AI which can use pre-existing WMDs without the consent or control of a human operator makes it just as dangerous as the WMDs it may have control over thus the necessity for its WMD classification.\n\nNot all AI should be banned.\n\nWhile there are numerous forms of AI which are dangerous, the UN should specifically ban only the development of AI capable of deploying WMDs without the prompt of a person. It is specifically this type of AI that I believe will be the easiest for states with WMDs and the rest of the global community to ban because of two reasons.\n\nFirst, the non-proliferation and the strict use against WMDs is already well ratified through various treaties and the addition of RAI merely modernizes and reinforces preexisting obligations. Party states to these treaties have avoided using WMDs against one another (otherwise none of us would be here reading this) for obvious reasons. Therefore, why would they not be interested in prohibiting an entity, not aligned with anyone, from doing the same?\n\nSecond, the ban is very specific to AI which may gain access to the deployment of WMD and acts without the prompt of a person. It therefore leaves room for the development of safe AI which are already supported by the UN such as ones that aid in humanitarian and scientific endeavors as mentioned by Unesco.\n\nIt is not contested by specialized agencies in different states and technology experts alike that AI poses a serious threat, whether that be through cybersecurity or the above-mentioned scenario. Despite this, there has been no firm joint statement by the international community or the United Nations universally banning the development of AI which might go rouge with a state's nuclear arsenal.\n\nEven now, private and government entities are heavily invested in the advancement of AI not only for commercial and scientific purposes but also to make present weapons smarter or to design new weapons which could not have been imagined without the help of AI. While there are treaties such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970, which deals with the prevention of spreading nuclear weapons and there disarmament, there is no similar treaty outright banning practices which may inadvertently lead to the creation of a rogue AI. The mentioned treaty is heralded by the UN as the \"cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferate regime.\" No such \"cornerstone\" treaty exists with respect to rouge AI.\n\nA UN declaration is not the solution, but it is the beginning of one.\n\nThe latter will achieve creating not only a global consensus on the vulnerability of our military equipment through unintended AI hijacking but will also put technology companies on notice that AI research and development, across the world, must be more firmly regulated to prevent catastrophe. Future work could focus on enumerating specific aspects of AI development which may lead to RAI which should be banned. This can be followed by the proposal of a task force, like the ones sent to North Korea in the past, either UN or state formed meant to oversee compliance from private and government institution.\n\nWe created the label \"WMD\" well after they were used on people (Hiroshima and Nagasaki). We should not wait for the birth of Rogue Artificial Intelligence before we begin labelling it. Waiting in fact may prove fatal. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri": "glenda_gloria@rappler.com", "name": "Glenda Gloria", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weapon of mass destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAI", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutual assured destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disarmament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disarmament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/08/AI-weapon-of-mass-destruction-aug-6-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792781", "eventUri": "eng-9792781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

A significant and surprising shift is the challenge a company like Google faces.\n\nOpenAI announced its entry into the search market with SearchGPT. This is the company that brought us ChatGPT. They are introducing an AI-powered search engine with real-time access to information across the Internet. To give it some context, this search engine and the AI and computing power behind it have Google and Microsoft's Bing quaking in their boots. AI is challenging the hegemony of established companies; this is a boardroom issue.\n\nThe SearchGPT search engine starts with a large textbox that prompts the user, \"What are you looking for?\" Its search results don't just give a plain list of links; the search engine organizes and makes sense of them. The search engine summarizes its findings and presents a short description, followed by an attribution link. The next generation of search engines, giving relevant and useful information, goes beyond what present engines do. Google is playing catch-up.\n\nThe idea that Google, synonymous with 'searching' has to worry about being surpassed by a small new player because of AI, is incredible. This is exactly what happened to Yahoo and AltaVista search engines when Google arrived. Today, it is search engines, and tomorrow, it is the financial services industry, followed by the healthcare sector. The old ways are no more, as AI's sheer computing power and machine learning capabilities will upend the status quo. Within a year or two, you can become obsolete. This is not something to be alarmed about, but needs our full and undivided attention. It must also be on the agenda at the boardroom level, not just something that the ICT department tinkers with.\n\nAI cannot be ignored if a company is serious about maintaining its competitive edge and providing quality products and services to its clients. Namibian companies need to embrace and embed it in their organization. The question is, how do you go about it and how do you ensure that you are using Artificial Intelligence applications in such a manner that they will complement your present operational activities? Namibian organizations, need to compensate for the lack of staffing, and smaller budgets and this is where AI comes into its own. Size no longer matters, innovation, improving efficiency, and delivering exceptional customer experiences are the key. If Google can be challenged by a tiny company in comparison, there is hope for us all, and AI is a key player in this journey, ensuring exceptional customer experiences.\n\nLarge organizations leverage AI to ensure that departments work together, and hospitals are starting to use it to speed up and improve the diagnosis of patients. The more AI is used, the better it becomes, improving cancer detection rates in patients, for example. Information and data are harnessed in such a way that it creates self-learning AI tools within the organization. This is why the C-level suite must focus on it, as the urgency and importance of AI in the business landscape cannot be overstated.\n\nOne of AI's advantages for smaller organizations is its ability to enhance decision-making processes.

While many regard it as remarkable in terms of technology, it's also seen as unacceptable from an artistic point of view and because of how machine learning works,\" Mizobe tells the outlet. The PocketPair CEO also thinks generative AI will \"unavoidably\" find its place in game development.\n\nIt's not very well known, but in 2022 PocketPair actually utilized generative AI in game development for a title called AI: Art Impostor. It's basically a party-based drawing game, played by three to eight people, where your team collaborates on an upcoming art exhibition using AI-generated art.\n\n\"AI: Art Impostor is something we made at a time when generative AI seemed like it would take off, which made us go, 'We've got to make a game using this technology!' Personally, I think it ended up being a good game, but we've received various opinions about it,\" Mizobe commented of the 2022 game. It's worth pointing out that AI: Art Impostor has just a 'Mixed' average user review rating on Steam after 390 reviews.\n\n\"What we're making is entertainment, so I don't want us to actively pursue something that's going to upset people. I want us to maintain a healthy distance from technological advancements,\" Mizobe concluded.\n\nPalworld's community lead recently stated that the studio never used AI to generate in-game character models, which comes after months of online speculation that PocketPair had utilized generative AI in development.

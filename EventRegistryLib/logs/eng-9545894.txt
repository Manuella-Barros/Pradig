The Brits will watch with caution after a bruising result for UK entry Mae Muller last year.\n\nCan Olly Alexander restore our national pride? Will there be a boycott of Israel?

The wider host city of Malm\u00f6 will also be running side events across the area in conjunction with the live shows.\n\nWhen is the Eurovision final?\n\nThe fun kicks off with the two semi-finals on May 7 and May 9, followed by the grand final on May 11.\n\nAll of the shows will be broadcast live. We'll see 37 countries competing in 2024 - including Luxembourg, which last appeared in the contest back in 1993.\n\nIn the first semi-final, 15 countries are competing: Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland, Lithuania, Poland, Serbia, Ukraine, Australia, Azerbaijan, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Moldova, Portugal, and Slovenia.\n\nIn the second semi-final, the remaining 16 will fight for a final place: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Czechia, Denmark, Greece, Malta, Switzerland, Belgium, Estonia, Georgia, Israel, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, and San Marino.\n\nThe so-called \"Big Five\" countries and host nation Sweden go through to the final automatically, but, for the first time this year, they will also perform in the semi-finals. Germany, Sweden and the UK perform in the first semi, and France, Italy and Spain in the second.\n\nAre Eurovision tickets still on sale and how much are they?\n\nWhile availability is limited, some tickets for the semi-finals, final and evening previews are still up for sale on Ticketmaster, with prices starting at 860 Swedish Krona.\n\nThis is equivalent to about \u00a363, ranging to 14890,00 Krona for VIP Packages, equivalent to about \u00a31,100.\n\nWho's hosting Eurovision in Sweden?\n\nAfter Loreen triumphed in Liverpool with her song Tattoo, the 2024 edition of Eurovision comes from Sweden. Hollywood actress Malin \u00c5kerman joins comedian and Eurovision regular Petra Mede to host the semi-finals and final from Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\nHas Sweden hosted Eurovision before?\n\nOh yes - this is the Scandi nation's seventh time as hosts, which is frankly showing off. They previously hosted the contest from Stockholm in 1975, 2000 and 2016, from Gothenburg in 1985, and from this year's choice Malm\u00f6 in 1992 and 2013.\n\nThat clutch of seven wins makes Sweden the most successful Eurovision nation ever - tied with Ireland. The UK isn't far behind, with five wins (although none, alas, in recent years).\n\nAre Swedes excited?\n\nThere's a definite buzz ahead of Eurovision, although also some concern given the current political sensitivities (of which more below). Malm\u00f6 is organising a full programme of events to keep visitors, estimated at 100,000, entertained, from drag shows and club nights to yet more musical performances.\n\nFortuitously, Sweden can also celebrate the 50th anniversary of Abba's Eurovision win (in Liverpool, in 1974) with their 2024 contest. There's even a rumour that Abba themselves might make a rare appearance to say thank you for the music.\n\nWhere and how to watch Eurovision final and semi-finals\n\nAll of the finals will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer: the semi-finals on May 7 and May 9, and the grand final on May 11.\n\nWho is representing the UK at Eurovision 2024?\n\nYears & Years lead singer Olly Alexander is Flying the flag for the UK this year.\n\nHe's a legitimate artist and a great performer. Alas, though, says the Telegraph's music critic Neil McCormick, his song Dizzy is just OK - an electro-dance-pop track somewhat in the vein of last year's winner Tattoo, but unlikely to be memorable in a competition where you have to go big (and then even bigger). This entry, Neil fears, is too formulaic to stand out.\n\nIs Israel still playing Eurovision?\n\nThis is the real talking point of the 2024 contest, despite organisers' frantic efforts to avoid political controversy at all costs.\n\nYou may remember that Russia was banned by Eurovision from participating in its 2022 contest following the country's invasion of Ukraine. Organisers the Eurovision Broadcasting Union (EBU) said the inclusion of Russia would \"bring the competition into disrepute\".\n\nBut what about Israel? Should the same rule apply? That's become a fiercely contested argument, not helped by Israel originally entering a provocative song. Several nations have seen protests and petitions about Israel's inclusion, and the Icelandic broadcaster R\u00daV seriously debated its participation in 2024 if Israel was involved, before ultimately deciding to stay in.\n\nA pro-Palestinian protestor invaded the stage during the first semi-final of Norway's Melodi Grand Prix (the country's Eurovision selection event), and audience members held up signs about the targeting of Palestinian children during Sweden's Melodifestivalen.\n\nProtest posters are already appearing in Malm\u00f6, and the Malm\u00f6 Live digital sign was spray-painted with \"Free Gaza\" in March. The Malm\u00f6 police have received requests for large-scale protests near the arena, both pro-Palestine and pro-Israel.\n\nMultiple Eurovision entrants, including the UK's Olly Alexander, signed a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages.\n\nEBU director general Noel Curran has said that Eurovision is taking the same stance as other major bodies like sports federations in keeping an inclusive stance towards Israel, and stated that Eurovision is \"a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\"\n\nHow did Israel change their entry?\n\nSo, Israel first submitted a song called October Rain, written by Avi Ohayon, Keren Peles and Stav Beger, and sung by 20-year-old Eden Golan. \"October\" recalls the horrific Hamas massacre, and the song's lyrics were initially pretty pointed too. \"I'm still wet from the October rain\"; \"There's so air left to breathe\"; \"They were all good children, each one of them\".\n\nA panicked EBU asked Israel to submit another song - and were met with fury. Culture minister Miki Zohar said on X (formerly Twitter) that the \"moving\" song expresses \"the feelings of the people and the country these days, and is not political.\" He added that it would be \"scandalous\" to disqualify it.\n\nHowever, a compromise was reached: the song was rewritten and became the less problematic Hurricane, now Israel's official entry. But critics claim that the music video clearly references the October music festival massacre via its dancers in a field, and that Golan wearing a top with a large hole in it suggests a bullet wound.\n\nIt's not ideal, to put it mildly, for a contest whose slogan is \"united by music\". Expect a charged atmosphere any time the Israeli entry is on stage.\n\nBut Russia is still banned?\n\nYes. Following the announcement of their Eurovision ban in 2022, Russia's state broadcasters suspended their membership of the EBU, preventing them from taking part in future competitions too.\n\nWill there be extra security this year?\n\nAlmost certainly, given the above. Malm\u00f6's police area manager Petra Stenkulla told local radio that Sweden currently has a terror threat level of four out of five, adding: \"We can never guarantee safety but we will do our utmost to make people feel safe.\"\n\nHow has social media reacted to Israel's involvement?\n\nThe EBU has recently put out a statement condemning abuse directed at participating artists over Israel's involvement in the contest. It acknowledges \"the depth of feeling\" that comes from a Eurovision \"set against the backdrop of a terrible war\", and supports freedom of speech, but opposes \"any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.\"\n\nThe statement finishes with a plea for constructive dialogue and support for the artists appearing \"on what is a music and entertainment show\", hoping to \"share their music with the world.\"\n\nWhich acts should we look out for in 2024?\n\nPolitics aside (whew), Eurovision is best known for its reliably madcap performances. Think banana-loving wolves, filthy milkmaids, and that guy in the giant hamster wheel. Or last year's joyful eyesore of an entry from Finland. There's no such thing as too weird.\n\nThe 2024 Irish entry, non-binary artist Bambie Thug's \"electro-metal breakdown\" Doomsday Blue, certainly has a lot going on. The lyrics contain spells - including killing curse Avada Kedavra, which you might recognise from Harry Potter - and the music video morphs between an angry witch and a dream world featuring the colours of the transgender flag.\n\nSpain's entry has already caused a row. Its foxy song title Zorra means \"vixen\", but is more usually misogynistic slang for \"bitch\" or \"slut\". Husband-and-wife singers Nebulossa say they're reclaiming it, and Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez waded in to defend the track from feminist criticism. The performance features male backing dancers in corsets and thongs, so perhaps it's equal-opportunities objectification.\n\nI have high hopes of deranged melodrama from Belgium's Mustii, whose music video sees him semi-naked, oiled up and using at least 20 fog machines. Croatia's excellently named Baby Lasagna gives us a shouty number about economic emigration, and this year's stress migraine comes courtesy of Estonia's hip-hop-folk-mash-up We (sure) know nothing about (these) drugs.\n\nBut can anyone top No Rules! by Finland's Teemu Keisteri aka Windows95man for sheer twaddle? While sporting that (pixelated, per Eurovision rules) Microsoft Windows logo in his performance, he hatched from a denim egg and haphazardly sprayed fire from his jean shorts. Finland's jury vote placed him dead last, but the public vote put him through. If he repeats the feat at Eurovision, expect a similarly marmite response.\n\nHow does the voting work exactly?\n\nIt's complicated. Until recently, voting comprised a mixture of tallies from the juries of individual countries with an element of public voting. However there was a big shake-up to the voting system last year after irregular voting patterns were discovered among the juries of six countries during a 2022 semi-final. Essentially Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and San Marino were all suspected of voting for each other.\n\nSo last year, for the first time, juries from individual countries were banned from deciding which nations progress from the semis to the Grand Final. Instead it's now determined solely by a public vote, and viewers from countries not taking part (so-called Rest of World countries) are able to vote for their favourite songs (paying \u20ac0.99 per vote for the privilege).\n\nHowever, the six countries with a bye to the final are only allowed to vote in one semi each. It's randomly allotted, and in 2024 British viewers can vote in the first semi-final only.\n\nBut that's just the semis. The rankings in the all-important Grand Final are decided by a combination of the points from countries' individual juries (\"douze points from Sarajevo\" etc.) and votes from viewers. Each person can vote up to 20 times but cannot select their own country's entry.\n\nUntil recently, votes in the final have been weighted 50-50 between juries and the public vote. But as of last year, votes from the Rest of World countries are combined to have the equivalent weight of one participating country. That alters the 50-50 ratio to give the general public a 50.6 per cent say in the winner, versus a 49.4 per cent say for the juries.\n\nKnotty, isn't it? And you thought it was just a cheesy singing competition.\n\nWill countries still just vote for their neighbours?\n\nGeopolitics does still inevitably stray into the contest in the form of block voting. Watch out for the Slavic vote, the Nordic vote and the Francophone vote. Not forgetting Greece and Cyprus, which always award each other the maximum 12 points. Expect ironic cheers when they invariably do so.\n\nMight Ukraine win Eurovision again?\n\nTheir 2024 entry isn't exactly a dead cert. Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil's warbly dance track is apparently inspired by Mother Teresa and the Virgin Mary, and features a pretty cringe solemn rap section. But voters may still want to show some love for Ukraine via Eurovision.\n\nDo performers sing live?\n\nYes, all lead vocals must be live. This includes any over-dubs by the singer that follow the song's melody. Performers can choose between pre-recorded backing vocals, live backing singers (either on or off stage) or a combination of live and recorded backing vocals. Songs must be original compositions and no longer than three minutes long. No more than six performers are allowed on stage during any one song.\n\nPre-recorded backing tracks were first allowed in 1973 so long as all the instruments that were pre-recorded were also seen being \"performed\" - or mimed - on stage. This rule was made redundant by the dawn of electronic music and scrapped in 1997, the year after Gina G's band had to cart massive computers onto the stage to perform Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit because those were the instruments on which the song was partially created.\n\nHow important is Eurovision to Europe?\n\nIt's an exercise in soft kitsch power, really. Although 160 million viewers around the world can't be bad for Europe's various tourist boards.\n\nThe host cities benefit too. Last year, around 100,000 extra people visited Liverpool, bringing in a net profit of \u00a354 million to the local economy.\n\nI thought this was Eurovision. How come Australia and Azerbaijan can enter?\n\nAustralians have always loved Eurovision. Despite being 7,000-odd miles away from Europe, the country was invited to perform during the interval of the competition's semi-finals in 2014. The following year Australia was given a one-off chance to compete in the actual finals due to it being Eurovision's 50th anniversary. Singer Guy Sebastian came fifth and so impressed the Eurovision hierarchy that Australia was allowed to return annually as a full-time competitor. If Australia wins the contest then it doesn't mean that participants would jet off to Sydney for the following year's bash. A special rule means that a victorious Australia would have to pick a European co-host to lay on the competition on its behalf.\n\nAnd Azerbaijan? Well, the \"Euro\" in Eurovision isn't really geographical. Rather it stems from the fact that the contest is organised by the EBU, which comprises broadcasters from counties in Europe and beyond. According to the EBU's website, it has 112 member organisations from 56 countries with an additional 30 associate members in Asia, Africa and elsewhere. Full-time members also include broadcasters from Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nWhy, then, isn't the USA in Eurovision?\n\nAmericans have historically viewed Eurovision as a quaint and eccentric curio. Things started to change in 2016 when some 50 million US households were able to watch it for the first time thanks to a deal between the EBU and Viacom.\n\nThen in 2020 the contest got the Will Ferrell treatment in the comedy film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga in which it was, largely, portrayed as a quaint and eccentric curio (although the film did receive an Oscar nomination for best original song).\n\nIn 2022, broadcaster NBC launched its own US-only version. The American Song Contest pitted 56 performers against each other: one from each of the US's 50 states, one from the capital Washington DC, plus one from each of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, US Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands. Oklahoma won. The contest was not repeated in 2023. Still, at least Americans can vote in the actual Eurovision now - through the official app or by visiting here.\n\nIs Eurovision good for your career?\n\nIt can be. Abba (1974), Celine Dion (1988) and Olivia Newton-John (1974) went on to become global superstars after Eurovision. The contest has also helped sustain the careers of artists who've already made it, such as Michael Ball (1992), Cliff Richard (1968) and Lulu (1969). And it has given boosts to performers in the later stages of their careers (Katrina and the Waves, Engelbert Humperdinck and Bonnie Tyler).\n\nM\u00e5neskin, the Italian winners from 2021, are now huge mainstream stars: they played London's O2 and Glastonbury last year. Sam Ryder, the UK's 2022 runner-up, has done pretty well for himself too. But for every artist who makes it, dozens don't.

All your questions answered", "body": "Can UK entrant Olly Alexander make up for Mae Muller's flop? Is Israel taking part? Is Russia still banned? And could Ukraine win again?\n\nThe 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, the biggest and longest-running music competition in the world, will take place this May - and it promises to be as brilliantly bonkers, and as politically fraught, as ever. The Brits will watch with caution after a bruising result for UK entry Mae Muller last year.\n\nCan Olly Alexander restore our national pride? Will there be a boycott of Israel? And when can you watch? Here are all your burning 2024 Eurovision questions answered.\n\nWhere is Eurovision?When is the Eurovision final?Are there any tickets left?Who's hosting Eurovision?Are Swedes excited?Who is representing the UK at Eurovision 2024?Is Israel still playing Eurovision?Is Russia still banned?Will there be extra security this year?Which acts should we look out for in 2024?How does the voting work exactly?Do performers sing live?How come Australia and Azerbaijan can enter?Where is Eurovision?\n\nEurovision will take place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. The stadium is Sweden's second-largest indoor arena.\n\nThe 15,500 capacity building has previously held the contest back in 2013. The wider host city of Malm\u00f6 will also be running side events across the area in conjunction with the live shows.\n\nWhen is the Eurovision final?\n\nThe fun kicked off on May 7 with the first of two semi-finals. The second is on May 9, followed by the grand final on May 11.\n\nAll of the shows are broadcast live. We'll see 37 countries competing in 2024 - including Luxembourg, which last appeared in the contest back in 1993.\n\nIn the first semi-final, 15 countries competed for a place in the final. Ukraine, Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Lithuania, Cyprus, Finland, Croatia, Ireland and Luxembourg all made it through; Poland, Iceland, Moldova, Azerbaijan and Australia were eliminated.\n\nIn the second semi-final, the remaining 16 will fight for a final place: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Czechia, Denmark, Greece, Malta, Switzerland, Belgium, Estonia, Georgia, Israel, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, and San Marino.\n\nThe so-called \"Big Five\" countries and host nation Sweden go through to the final automatically, but, for the first time this year, they will also perform in the semi-finals. Germany, Sweden and the UK perform in the first semi, and France, Italy and Spain in the second.\n\nAre Eurovision tickets still on sale and how much are they?\n\nWhile availability is limited, some tickets for the semi-finals, final and evening previews are still up for sale on Ticketmaster, with prices starting at 860 Swedish Krona.\n\nThis is equivalent to about \u00a363, ranging to 14890,00 Krona for VIP Packages, equivalent to about \u00a31,100.\n\nWho's hosting Eurovision in Sweden?\n\nAfter Loreen triumphed in Liverpool with her song Tattoo, the 2024 edition of Eurovision comes from Sweden. Hollywood actress Malin \u00c5kerman joins comedian and Eurovision regular Petra Mede to host the semi-finals and final from Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\nHas Sweden hosted Eurovision before?\n\nOh yes - this is the Scandi nation's seventh time as hosts, which is frankly showing off. They previously hosted the contest from Stockholm in 1975, 2000 and 2016, from Gothenburg in 1985, and from this year's choice Malm\u00f6 in 1992 and 2013.\n\nThat clutch of seven wins makes Sweden the most successful Eurovision nation ever - tied with Ireland. The UK isn't far behind, with five wins (although none, alas, in recent years).\n\nAre Swedes excited?\n\nThere's a definite buzz ahead of Eurovision, although also some concern given the current political sensitivities (of which more below). Malm\u00f6 is organising a full programme of events to keep visitors, estimated at 100,000, entertained, from drag shows and club nights to yet more musical performances.\n\nFortuitously, Sweden can also celebrate the 50th anniversary of Abba's Eurovision win (in Liverpool, in 1974) with their 2024 contest. There's even a rumour that Abba themselves might make a rare appearance to say thank you for the music.\n\nWhere and how to watch Eurovision final and semi-finals\n\nAll of the finals will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer: the remaining semi-final on May 9, and the grand final on May 11.\n\nWho is representing the UK at Eurovision 2024?\n\nYears & Years lead singer Olly Alexander is Flying the flag for the UK this year.\n\nHe's a legitimate artist and a great performer. Alas, though, says the Telegraph's music critic Neil McCormick, his song Dizzy is just OK - an electro-dance-pop track somewhat in the vein of last year's winner Tattoo, but unlikely to be memorable in a competition where you have to go big (and then even bigger). This entry, Neil fears, is too formulaic to stand out.\n\nIs Israel still playing Eurovision?\n\nThis is the real talking point of the 2024 contest, despite organisers' frantic efforts to avoid political controversy at all costs.\n\nYou may remember that Russia was banned by Eurovision from participating in its 2022 contest following the country's invasion of Ukraine. Organisers the Eurovision Broadcasting Union (EBU) said the inclusion of Russia would \"bring the competition into disrepute\".\n\nBut what about Israel? Should the same rule apply? That's become a fiercely contested argument, not helped by Israel originally entering a provocative song. Several nations have seen protests and petitions about Israel's inclusion, and the Icelandic broadcaster R\u00daV seriously debated its participation in 2024 if Israel was involved, before ultimately deciding to stay in.\n\nA pro-Palestinian protestor invaded the stage during the first semi-final of Norway's Melodi Grand Prix (the country's Eurovision selection event), and audience members held up signs about the targeting of Palestinian children during Sweden's Melodifestivalen.\n\nProtest posters are already appearing in Malm\u00f6, and the Malm\u00f6 Live digital sign was spray-painted with \"Free Gaza\" in March. The Malm\u00f6 police have received requests for large-scale protests near the arena, both pro-Palestine and pro-Israel.\n\nMultiple Eurovision entrants, including the UK's Olly Alexander, signed a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages.\n\nEBU director general Noel Curran has said that Eurovision is taking the same stance as other major bodies like sports federations in keeping an inclusive stance towards Israel, and stated that Eurovision is \"a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\"\n\nHow did Israel change their entry?\n\nSo, Israel first submitted a song called October Rain, written by Avi Ohayon, Keren Peles and Stav Beger, and sung by 20-year-old Eden Golan. \"October\" recalls the horrific Hamas massacre, and the song's lyrics were initially pretty pointed too. \"I'm still wet from the October rain\"; \"There's so air left to breathe\"; \"They were all good children, each one of them\".\n\nA panicked EBU asked Israel to submit another song - and were met with fury. Culture minister Miki Zohar said on X (formerly Twitter) that the \"moving\" song expresses \"the feelings of the people and the country these days, and is not political.\" He added that it would be \"scandalous\" to disqualify it.\n\nHowever, a compromise was reached: the song was rewritten and became the less problematic Hurricane, now Israel's official entry. But critics claim that the music video clearly references the October music festival massacre via its dancers in a field, and that Golan wearing a top with a large hole in it suggests a bullet wound.\n\nIt's not ideal, to put it mildly, for a contest whose slogan is \"united by music\". Expect a charged atmosphere any time the Israeli entry is on stage.\n\nBut Russia is still banned?\n\nYes. Following the announcement of their Eurovision ban in 2022, Russia's state broadcasters suspended their membership of the EBU, preventing them from taking part in future competitions too.\n\nWill there be extra security this year at Malm\u00f6?\n\nAlmost certainly, given the above. Malm\u00f6's police area manager Petra Stenkulla told local radio that Sweden currently has a terror threat level of four out of five, adding: \"We can never guarantee safety but we will do our utmost to make people feel safe.\"\n\nHow has social media reacted to Israel's involvement?\n\nThe EBU has recently put out a statement condemning abuse directed at participating artists over Israel's involvement in the contest. It acknowledges \"the depth of feeling\" that comes from a Eurovision \"set against the backdrop of a terrible war\", and supports freedom of speech, but opposes \"any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.\"\n\nThe statement finishes with a plea for constructive dialogue and support for the artists appearing \"on what is a music and entertainment show\", hoping to \"share their music with the world.\"\n\nWhich acts should we look out for in 2024?\n\nPolitics aside (whew), Eurovision is best known for its reliably madcap performances. Think banana-loving wolves, filthy milkmaids, and that guy in the giant hamster wheel. Or last year's joyful eyesore of an entry from Finland. There's no such thing as too weird.\n\nThe 2024 Irish entry, non-binary artist Bambie Thug's \"electro-metal breakdown\" Doomsday Blue, certainly has a lot going on. The lyrics contain spells - including killing curse Avada Kedavra, which you might recognise from Harry Potter - and the music video morphs between an angry witch and a dream world featuring the colours of the transgender flag.\n\nSpain's entry has already caused a row. Its foxy song title Zorra means \"vixen\", but is more usually misogynistic slang for \"bitch\" or \"slut\". Husband-and-wife singers Nebulossa say they're reclaiming it, and Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez waded in to defend the track from feminist criticism. The performance features male backing dancers in corsets and thongs, so perhaps it's equal-opportunities objectification.\n\nI have high hopes of deranged melodrama from Belgium's Mustii, whose music video sees him semi-naked, oiled up and using at least 20 fog machines. Croatia's excellently named Baby Lasagna gives us a shouty number about economic emigration, and this year's stress migraine comes courtesy of Estonia's hip-hop-folk-mash-up We (sure) know nothing about (these) drugs.\n\nBut can anyone top No Rules! by Finland's Teemu Keisteri aka Windows95man for sheer twaddle? While sporting that (pixelated, per Eurovision rules) Microsoft Windows logo in his performance, he hatched from a denim egg and haphazardly sprayed fire from his jean shorts. Finland's jury vote placed him dead last, but the public vote put him through.\n\nHow does the voting work exactly?\n\nIt's complicated. Until recently, voting comprised a mixture of tallies from the juries of individual countries with an element of public voting. However there was a big shake-up to the voting system last year after irregular voting patterns were discovered among the juries of six countries during a 2022 semi-final. Essentially Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and San Marino were all suspected of voting for each other.\n\nSo last year, for the first time, juries from individual countries were banned from deciding which nations progress from the semis to the Grand Final. Instead it's now determined solely by a public vote, and viewers from countries not taking part (so-called Rest of World countries) are able to vote for their favourite songs (paying \u20ac0.99 per vote for the privilege).\n\nHowever, the six countries with a bye to the final are only allowed to vote in one semi each. It's randomly allotted, and in 2024 British viewers can vote in the first semi-final only.\n\nBut that's just the semis. The rankings in the all-important Grand Final are decided by a combination of the points from countries' individual juries (\"douze points from Sarajevo\" etc.) and votes from viewers. Each person can vote up to 20 times but cannot select their own country's entry.\n\nUntil recently, votes in the final have been weighted 50-50 between juries and the public vote. But as of last year, votes from the Rest of World countries are combined to have the equivalent weight of one participating country. That alters the 50-50 ratio to give the general public a 50.6 per cent say in the winner, versus a 49.4 per cent say for the juries.\n\nKnotty, isn't it? And you thought it was just a cheesy singing competition.\n\nWill countries still just vote for their neighbours?\n\nGeopolitics does still inevitably stray into the contest in the form of block voting. Watch out for the Slavic vote, the Nordic vote and the Francophone vote. Not forgetting Greece and Cyprus, which always award each other the maximum 12 points. Expect ironic cheers when they invariably do so.\n\nMight Ukraine win Eurovision again?\n\nTheir 2024 entry isn't exactly a dead cert. Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil's warbly dance track is apparently inspired by Mother Teresa and the Virgin Mary, and features a pretty cringe solemn rap section. But voters may still want to show some love for Ukraine via Eurovision.\n\nDo performers sing live?\n\nYes, all lead vocals must be live. This includes any over-dubs by the singer that follow the song's melody. Performers can choose between pre-recorded backing vocals, live backing singers (either on or off stage) or a combination of live and recorded backing vocals. Songs must be original compositions and no longer than three minutes long. No more than six performers are allowed on stage during any one song.\n\nPre-recorded backing tracks were first allowed in 1973 so long as all the instruments that were pre-recorded were also seen being \"performed\" - or mimed - on stage. This rule was made redundant by the dawn of electronic music and scrapped in 1997, the year after Gina G's band had to cart massive computers onto the stage to perform Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit because those were the instruments on which the song was partially created.\n\nHow important is Eurovision to Europe?\n\nIt's an exercise in soft kitsch power, really. Although 160 million viewers around the world can't be bad for Europe's various tourist boards.\n\nThe host cities benefit too. Last year, around 100,000 extra people visited Liverpool, bringing in a net profit of \u00a354 million to the local economy.\n\nI thought this was Eurovision. How come Australia and Azerbaijan can enter?\n\nBoth countries were eliminated in the first semi-final, but the fact that they enter at all still baffles many. Australians have always loved Eurovision. Despite being 7,000-odd miles away from Europe, the country was invited to perform during the interval of the competition's semi-finals in 2014. The following year Australia was given a one-off chance to compete in the actual finals due to it being Eurovision's 50th anniversary. Singer Guy Sebastian came fifth and so impressed the Eurovision hierarchy that Australia was allowed to return annually as a full-time competitor. If Australia wins the contest then it doesn't mean that participants would jet off to Sydney for the following year's bash. A special rule means that a victorious Australia would have to pick a European co-host to lay on the competition on its behalf.\n\nAnd Azerbaijan? Well, the \"Euro\" in Eurovision isn't really geographical. Rather it stems from the fact that the contest is organised by the EBU, which comprises broadcasters from counties in Europe and beyond. According to the EBU's website, it has 112 member organisations from 56 countries with an additional 30 associate members in Asia, Africa and elsewhere. Full-time members also include broadcasters from Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nWhy, then, isn't the USA in Eurovision?\n\nAmericans have historically viewed Eurovision as a quaint and eccentric curio. Things started to change in 2016 when some 50 million US households were able to watch it for the first time thanks to a deal between the EBU and Viacom.\n\nThen in 2020 the contest got the Will Ferrell treatment in the comedy film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga in which it was, largely, portrayed as a quaint and eccentric curio (although the film did receive an Oscar nomination for best original song).\n\nIn 2022, broadcaster NBC launched its own US-only version. The American Song Contest pitted 56 performers against each other: one from each of the US's 50 states, one from the capital Washington DC, plus one from each of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, US Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands. Oklahoma won. The contest was not repeated in 2023. Still, at least Americans can vote in the actual Eurovision now - through the official app or by visiting here.\n\nIs Eurovision good for your career?\n\nIt can be. Abba (1974), Celine Dion (1988) and Olivia Newton-John (1974) went on to become global superstars after Eurovision. The contest has also helped sustain the careers of artists who've already made it, such as Michael Ball (1992), Cliff Richard (1968) and Lulu (1969). And it has given boosts to performers in the later stages of their careers (Katrina and the Waves, Engelbert Humperdinck and Bonnie Tyler).\n\nM\u00e5neskin, the Italian winners from 2021, are now huge mainstream stars: they played London's O2 and Glastonbury last year. Sam Ryder, the UK's 2022 runner-up, has done pretty well for himself too. But for every artist who makes it, dozens don't.

Jessica Gow / TT News Agency / AFP via Getty Images\n\nAs Eurovision fans know, anything can happen at the annual Eurovision Song Contest -- as demonstrated by Catherine, Princess of Wales, kicking off the 2023 finals by surprising fans with her piano skills.\n\nThe annual songwriting competition is organized by the European Broadcasting Union and showcases often boundary-breaking artists and musicians from around the world who represent their countries by performing original songs on a global stage.\n\nPast Eurovision winners include ABBA and Celine Dion, both of whom scored international success after their triumphs. In 2021, the crown went to Italian glam rock band M\u00e5neskin, who later that year scored a Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with the song \"Beggin.'\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest, which has been televised since its 1956 debut, takes place this year in Malm\u00f6, Sweden.\n\nWhile the United States doesn't participate in Eurovision, American fans can tune into the excitement from home.\n\nThe 2024 Eurovision Song Contest will be broadcast in the U.S. exclusively on Peacock. (Peacock is owned by NBCUniversal, TODAY's parent company.)\n\nRead on to learn more about the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest and how U.S. fans can watch it.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is an international songwriting competition organized annually by the European Broadcasting Union and broadcast live on television.\n\nThe contest showcases artists and performers from around the world who represent their countries by performing original songs during global performances watched by more than 160 million viewers, according to Peacock.\n\nThis year, 37 different countries from Europe and beyond will be competing, according to the official Eurovision website.\n\nThe contest is organized into two semi-finals, during which the initial 37 acts will be narrowed down to 26. That's followed by a grand final, after which the winner of Eurovision 2024 will be selected.\n\nThe winner of Eurovision is decided by two forms of voting: a jury of five music industry experts from each country, and live votes cast by viewers, who can vote by telephone, SMS, or via the official Eurovision app, contest organizers explain.\n\nThe 2024 Eurovision Song Contest will take place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden from Tuesday, May 7, 2024 to Saturday May 11, 2024.\n\nAll three Eurovision 2024 shows will stream live on Peacock.\n\nThe 2024 Eurovision Song Contest's grand finale will air at 3 p.m. ET on Saturday, May 11.", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest",

With this language, the performance will also mark the first time that an Australian/Aboriginal language song has been part of Eurovision.\n\nAustralia's participation in the European competition might seem confusing, given the country isn't in Europe. There's some logic behind the choice and legitimate reasons for them to be there, though.\n\nFor all the ins and outs on how Australia ended up in the Song Contest, and what happens if they were to win Eurovision, read for all you need to know.\n\nWhy is Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest?\n\nAussies have been watching Eurovision for more than 30 years and in 2014 they were invited to perform during the interval at the semi-finals.\n\nThen, Australia was given a special one-off chance to compete for the Eurovision title in 2015, the year in which the competition celebrated its 50th birthday. They qualified automatically for a spot in the Grand Final and singer Guy Sebastian finished in a very respectable fifth place.\n\nEurovision bosses were so impressed with their efforts that Australia was allowed to return on an annual basis - but they now have to qualify for their spot by competing in the semi-finals.\n\nAustralia aren't the only non-European country competing either.\n\nWhy are Israel and Azerbaijan allowed to compete in Eurovision?\n\nWell, Eurovision isn't strictly geographic. The contest is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is made up of various broadcasters from countries across Europe and beyond. The BBC is a member of the EBU, as is RTE in Ireland, Rai in Italy, SVT in Sweden and so on. There are 73 member stations from more than 56 countries, and they're entitled to send acts to Eurovision if they wish.\n\nSo that's why you see so many countries that you wouldn't usually associate with Europe competing on the Eurovision stage.\n\nWhat happens if Australia wins the Eurovision Song Contest?\n\nWe very nearly found out in 2016, when Dami Im stormed the competition and finished in second place with Sound of Silence. Everyone thought they might have to pack their bags and head Down Under for an Aussie Eurovision.\n\nBut that will probably never happen as there's a special rule in place.\n\nIf Australia wins the Eurovision it must nominate a European co-host, who will stage the competition on their behalf.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Let's look at what the bookies think before we start betting on Eurovision 2024.\n\nThis year Croatia leads the predictions for winning Eurovision with Lasagna Baby - Rim Tim Tagi Dim. Fun fact: Croatia has never won the Eurovision as a sovereign nation. The closest has been 4th place in 1996 and 1999. However, this year Croatia is a rare favourite heading into the finals.\n\nBet on Croatia to win Eurovision at Vbet\n\nCroatia's song is not what we usually see in Eurovision. However, it is a clear favourite amongst the bookmakers. It also won the OGAE poll, where the most dedicated Eurovision fans vote.\n\nIt was not a landslide win at the OGAE poll. It won by 356 followed by Italy with 338, making Italy a quite good value bet with the current odds 6/1 odds.\n\nThe 2024 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest will be held at the Malm\u00f6 Arena in Malm\u00f6, Sweden.\n\nWhen is the Eurovision Song Contest happening in 2024?\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest Finals 2024 will start on the 7th of May with the first semi-final. The second semi-final will be held on Thursday the 9th of May, leading up to the big finale on the 11th of May.\n\nWho won last year's Eurovision?\n\nThe 2023 Eurovision Song Contest was won by Swedish singer Loreen with the song \"Tattoo\". Sweden took the title with 583 points, with Finland's K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4 coming second with 526 points for his song \"Cha Cha Cha\".\n\nCan I bet on the Eurovision 2024 Song Contest in the UK?\n\nYes. Several top bookmakers will offer punters the chance to bet on the Eurovision Song Contest 2024. Due to the popularity of the event, many bookies will run promotional offers and prices, giving customers a chance to boost their potential winnings.\n\nWhile you may be used to betting only on more traditional stuff like horse racing, football, or even politics, why not try your hand and take part in Eurovision betting? After all, many sign-up promos and specials offer free bets you can take advantage of after registration - and who says those bet stakes can't be used for Eurovision?\n\nWhat are the Eurovision odds for UK's Olly Alexander to win in 2024?\n\nSadly for the UK, Olly Alexander doesn't look likely to win with odds at around 66/1 to win in Malm\u00f6.\n\nBet on UK's Olly Alexander to win Eurovision on home turf at 66/1 with VBET\n\nHow many times has the UK won Eurovision?\n\nThe UK has won the Eurovision Song Contest five times. Our first victory came back in 1967 when Sandy Shaw won with Puppet on a String. The most recent win was 26 years ago in 1997 when Katrina and the Waves won with Love Shine a Light.\n\nThe other three UK winners are Lulu, Bucks Fizz, and Brotherhood of Man. Frustratingly, the UK holds the record for finishing second the most, being runners-up on 16 occasions, with Sam Ryder becoming the most recent entry to that list two years ago.\n\nWhich countries are least likely to win Eurovision?\n\nNot all Eurovision entries are created equal, and these five countries are currently ranked the least likely to win Eurovision.\n\nOther countries not likely to win Eurovision include Albania, Moldova, Poland, Cyprus and Latvia.\n\nCan I win real money betting on Eurovision?\n\nYes! Many top UK bookmakers will allow players to bet and win real money on the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nAs usual, when choosing a bookie, every customer should ensure their favourite place among the best betting sites for Eurovision has fitting deposit requirements and qualifying bet minimums, minimal payment restrictions (e.g., acceptance of Skrill, Neteller, and paysafecard, aside from the usual debit card payments), SMS verification upon login, favourable bet settlement terms, and the Eurovision betting market they want.\n\nMy top 5 tips for betting on the Eurovision Song Contest in 2024\n\n1. Watch the semi-finals\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest doesn't just take place on one night. There are two semi-final events in the build-up to the final.\n\nWatching these can give you a good idea of how an artist is going to perform on the night and how well they are received by judges and the public.\n\nOf course, you can also check out all of the songs for the event on YouTube and music-streaming services in advance.\n\n2. Understand the format\n\nIt is important to remember that Eurovision has two points scoring stages, one for the judges and one for the public.\n\nThe televoting result is always read after the jury vote, greatly impacting how the final table looks.\n\nJust because a band has performed well with judges doesn't mean it has gone down well with the audience and vice versa.\n\n3. Remain objective\n\nIt's important to remember that there is a strong chance that the band or performer you like the most doesn't win the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMaking your decision based on which band you thought was best is extremely risky, as your taste may differ massively from that of the wider public and the jury. Betting against your favourite can be tricky, but remaining objective is essential to succeed.\n\nThe build-up to Eurovision can provide useful clues as to who will likely win on the night. Check out social-media reactions to each of the announced entrants, head over to YouTube and watch their videos, and keep an eye on who bookies are tipping to succeed on the night.\n\nSimilar to awards like the Oscars, Eurovision typically comes down to just a few favourites on the night, with the rest of the acts making up the numbers.\n\n5. Look for bonuses\n\nEurovision is one of the most popular entertainment markets to bet on, and with the event being held in the UK for the first time since 1998, bookies will want to tempt customers in.\n\nAs such, you will find plenty of price boosts available, as well as bonuses and free bets that you can use on the night.\n\nUsers should remember to look over every promotion and customer offer for bonus wagering and weighting requirements, restrictions on payment methods for qualifying deposits (e.g., debit card deposits being the only way to get the bonus amount), set markets for betting, etc.\n\nFor help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to www.gamstop.co.uk", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"},

The Brits will watch with caution after a bruising result for UK entry Mae Muller last year.\n\nCan Olly Alexander restore our national pride? Will there be a boycott of Israel? And when can you watch? Here are all your burning 2024 Eurovision questions answered.\n\nEurovision will take place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. The stadium is Sweden's second-largest indoor arena.\n\nThe 15,500 capacity building has previously held the contest back in 2013. The wider host city of Malm\u00f6 will also be running side events across the area in conjunction with the live shows.\n\nThe fun kicks off with the two semi-finals on May 7 and May 9, followed by the grand final on May 11.\n\nAll of the shows will be broadcast live. We'll see 37 countries competing in 2024 - including Luxembourg, which last appeared in the contest back in 1993.\n\nIn the first semi-final, 15 countries are competing: Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland, Lithuania, Poland, Serbia, Ukraine, Australia, Azerbaijan, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Moldova, Portugal, and Slovenia.\n\nIn the second semi-final, the remaining 16 will fight for a final place: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Czechia, Denmark, Greece, Malta, Switzerland, Belgium, Estonia, Georgia, Israel, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, and San Marino.\n\nThe so-called \"Big Five\" countries and host nation Sweden go through to the final automatically, but, for the first time this year, they will also perform in the semi-finals. Germany, Sweden and the UK perform in the first semi, and France, Italy and Spain in the second.\n\nWhile availability is limited, some tickets for the semi-finals, final and evening previews are still up for sale on Ticketmaster, with prices starting at 860 Swedish Krona.\n\nThis is equivalent to about \u00a363, ranging to 14890,00 Krona for VIP Packages, equivalent to about \u00a31,100.\n\nAfter Loreen triumphed in Liverpool with her song Tattoo, the 2024 edition of Eurovision comes from Sweden. Hollywood actress Malin \u00c5kerman joins comedian and Eurovision regular Petra Mede to host the semi-finals and final from Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\nOh yes - this is the Scandi nation's seventh time as hosts, which is frankly showing off. They previously hosted the contest from Stockholm in 1975, 2000 and 2016, from Gothenburg in 1985, and from this year's choice Malm\u00f6 in 1992 and 2013.\n\nThat clutch of seven wins makes Sweden the most successful Eurovision nation ever - tied with Ireland. The UK isn't far behind, with five wins (although none, alas, in recent years).\n\nThere's a definite buzz ahead of Eurovision, although also some concern given the current political sensitivities (of which more below). Malm\u00f6 is organising a full programme of events to keep visitors, estimated at 100,000, entertained, from drag shows and club nights to yet more musical performances.\n\nFortuitously, Sweden can also celebrate the 50 anniversary of Abba's Eurovision win (in Liverpool, in 1974) with their 2024 contest. There's even a rumour that Abba themselves might make a rare appearance to say thank you for the music.\n\nAll of the finals will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer: the semi-finals on May 7 and May 9, and the grand final on May 11.\n\nYears & Years lead singer Olly Alexander is Flying the flag for the UK this year.\n\nHe's a legitimate artist and a great performer. Alas, though, says the Telegraph's music critic Neil McCormick, his song Dizzy is just OK - an electro-dance-pop track somewhat in the vein of last year's winner Tattoo, but unlikely to be memorable in a competition where you have to go big (and then even bigger). This entry, Neil fears, is too formulaic to stand out.\n\nThis is the real talking point of the 2024 contest, despite organisers' frantic efforts to avoid political controversy at all costs.\n\nYou may remember that Russia was banned by Eurovision from participating in its 2022 contest following the country's invasion of Ukraine. Organisers the Eurovision Broadcasting Union (EBU) said the inclusion of Russia would \"bring the competition into disrepute\".\n\nBut what about Israel? Should the same rule apply? That's become a fiercely contested argument, not helped by Israel originally entering a provocative song. Several nations have seen protests and petitions about Israel's inclusion, and the Icelandic broadcaster R\u00daV seriously debated its participation in 2024 if Israel was involved, before ultimately deciding to stay in.\n\nA pro-Palestinian protestor invaded the stage during the first semi-final of Norway's Melodi Grand Prix (the country's Eurovision selection event), and audience members held up signs about the targeting of Palestinian children during Sweden's Melodifestivalen.\n\nProtest posters are already appearing in Malm\u00f6, and the Malm\u00f6 Live digital sign was spray-painted with \"Free Gaza\" in March. The Malm\u00f6 police have received requests for large-scale protests near the arena, both pro-Palestine and pro-Israel.\n\nMultiple Eurovision entrants, including the UK's Olly Alexander, signed a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages.\n\nEBU director general Noel Curran has said that Eurovision is taking the same stance as other major bodies like sports federations in keeping an inclusive stance towards Israel, and stated that Eurovision is \"a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\"\n\nSo, Israel first submitted a song called October Rain, written by Avi Ohayon, Keren Peles and Stav Beger, and sung by 20-year-old Eden Golan. \"October\" recalls the horrific Hamas massacre, and the song's lyrics were initially pretty pointed too. \"I'm still wet from the October rain\"; \"There's so air left to breathe\"; \"They were all good children, each one of them\".\n\nA panicked EBU asked Israel to submit another song - and were met with fury. Culture minister Miki Zohar said on X (formerly Twitter) that the \"moving\" song expresses \"the feelings of the people and the country these days, and is not political.\" He added that it would be \"scandalous\" to disqualify it.\n\nHowever, a compromise was reached: the song was rewritten and became the less problematic Hurricane, now Israel's official entry. But critics claim that the music video clearly references the October music festival massacre via its dancers in a field, and that Golan wearing a top with a large hole in it suggests a bullet wound.\n\nIt's not ideal, to put it mildly, for a contest whose slogan is \"united by music\". Expect a charged atmosphere any time the Israeli entry is on stage.\n\nYes. Following the announcement of their Eurovision ban in 2022, Russia's state broadcasters suspended their membership of the EBU, preventing them from taking part in future competitions too.\n\nAlmost certainly, given the above. Malm\u00f6's police area manager Petra Stenkulla told local radio that Sweden currently has a terror threat level of four out of five, adding: \"We can never guarantee safety but we will do our utmost to make people feel safe.\"\n\nThe EBU has recently put out a statement condemning abuse directed at participating artists over Israel's involvement in the contest. It acknowledges \"the depth of feeling\" that comes from a Eurovision \"set against the backdrop of a terrible war\", and supports freedom of speech, but opposes \"any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.\"\n\nThe statement finishes with a plea for constructive dialogue and support for the artists appearing \"on what is a music and entertainment show\", hoping to \"share their music with the world.\"\n\nPolitics aside (whew), Eurovision is best known for its reliably madcap performances. Think banana-loving wolves, filthy milkmaids, and that guy in the giant hamster wheel. Or last year's joyful eyesore of an entry from Finland. There's no such thing as too weird.\n\nThe 2024 Irish entry, non-binary artist Bambie Thug's \"electro-metal breakdown\" Doomsday Blue, certainly has a lot going on. The lyrics contain spells - including killing curse Avada Kedavra, which you might recognise from Harry Potter - and the music video morphs between an angry witch and a dream world featuring the colours of the transgender flag.\n\nSpain's entry has already caused a row. Its foxy song title Zorra means \"vixen\", but is more usually misogynistic slang for \"bitch\" or \"slut\". Husband-and-wife singers Nebulossa say they're reclaiming it, and Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez waded in to defend the track from feminist criticism. The performance features male backing dancers in corsets and thongs, so perhaps it's equal-opportunities objectification.\n\nI have high hopes of deranged melodrama from Belgium's Mustii, whose music video sees him semi-naked, oiled up and using at least 20 fog machines. Croatia's excellently named Baby Lasagna gives us a shouty number about economic emigration, and this year's stress migraine comes courtesy of Estonia's hip-hop-folk-mash-up We (sure) know nothing about (these) drugs.\n\nBut can anyone top No Rules! by Finland's Teemu Keisteri aka Windows95man for sheer twaddle? While sporting that (pixelated, per Eurovision rules) Microsoft Windows logo in his performance, he hatched from a denim egg and haphazardly sprayed fire from his jean shorts. Finland's jury vote placed him dead last, but the public vote put him through. If he repeats the feat at Eurovision, expect a similarly marmite response.\n\nIt's complicated. Until recently, voting comprised a mixture of tallies from the juries of individual countries with an element of public voting. However there was a big shake-up to the voting system last year after irregular voting patterns were discovered among the juries of six countries during a 2022 semi-final. Essentially Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and San Marino were all suspected of voting for each other.\n\nSo last year, for the first time, juries from individual countries were banned from deciding which nations progress from the semis to the Grand Final. Instead it's now determined solely by a public vote, and viewers from countries not taking part (so-called Rest of World countries) are able to vote for their favourite songs (paying \u20ac0.99 per vote for the privilege).\n\nHowever, the six countries with a bye to the final are only allowed to vote in one semi each. It's randomly allotted, and in 2024 British viewers can vote in the first semi-final only.\n\nBut that's just the semis. The rankings in the all-important Grand Final are decided by a combination of the points from countries' individual juries (\"douze points from Sarajevo\" etc.) and votes from viewers. Each person can vote up to 20 times but cannot select their own country's entry.\n\nUntil recently, votes in the final have been weighted 50-50 between juries and the public vote. But as of last year, votes from the Rest of World countries are combined to have the equivalent weight of one participating country. That alters the 50-50 ratio to give the general public a 50.6 per cent say in the winner, versus a 49.4 per cent say for the juries.\n\nKnotty, isn't it? And you thought it was just a cheesy singing competition.\n\nGeopolitics does still inevitably stray into the contest in the form of block voting. Watch out for the Slavic vote, the Nordic vote and the Francophone vote. Not forgetting Greece and Cyprus, which always award each other the maximum 12 points. Expect ironic cheers when they invariably do so.\n\nTheir 2024 entry isn't exactly a dead cert. Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil's warbly dance track is apparently inspired by Mother Teresa and the Virgin Mary, and features a pretty cringe solemn rap section. But voters may still want to show some love for Ukraine via Eurovision.\n\nYes, all lead vocals must be live. This includes any over-dubs by the singer that follow the song's melody. Performers can choose between pre-recorded backing vocals, live backing singers (either on or off stage) or a combination of live and recorded backing vocals. Songs must be original compositions and no longer than three minutes long. No more than six performers are allowed on stage during any one song.\n\nPre-recorded backing tracks were first allowed in 1973 so long as all the instruments that were pre-recorded were also seen being \"performed\" - or mimed - on stage. This rule was made redundant by the dawn of electronic music and scrapped in 1997, the year after Gina G's band had to cart massive computers onto the stage to perform Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit because those were the instruments on which the song was partially created.\n\nIt's an exercise in soft kitsch power, really. Although 160 million viewers around the world can't be bad for Europe's various tourist boards.\n\nThe host cities benefit too. Last year, around 100,000 extra people visited Liverpool, bringing in a net profit of \u00a354 million to the local economy.\n\nAustralians have always loved Eurovision. Despite being 7,000-odd miles away from Europe, the country was invited to perform during the interval of the competition's semi-finals in 2014. The following year Australia was given a one-off chance to compete in the actual finals due to it being Eurovision's 50th anniversary. Singer Guy Sebastian came fifth and so impressed the Eurovision hierarchy that Australia was allowed to return annually as a full-time competitor. If Australia wins the contest then it doesn't mean that participants would jet off to Sydney for the following year's bash. A special rule means that a victorious Australia would have to pick a European co-host to lay on the competition on its behalf.\n\nAnd Azerbaijan? Well, the \"Euro\" in Eurovision isn't really geographical. Rather it stems from the fact that the contest is organised by the EBU, which comprises broadcasters from counties in Europe and beyond. According to the EBU's website, it has 112 member organisations from 56 countries with an additional 30 associate members in Asia, Africa and elsewhere. Full-time members also include broadcasters from Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nAmericans have historically viewed Eurovision as a quaint and eccentric curio. Things started to change in 2016 when some 50 million US households were able to watch it for the first time thanks to a deal between the EBU and Viacom.\n\nThen in 2020 the contest got the Will Ferrell treatment in the comedy film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga in which it was, largely, portrayed as a quaint and eccentric curio (although the film did receive an Oscar nomination for best original song).\n\nIn 2022, broadcaster NBC launched its own US-only version. The American Song Contest pitted 56 performers against each other: one from each of the US's 50 states, one from the capital Washington DC, plus one from each of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, US Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands. Oklahoma won. The contest was not repeated in 2023. Still, at least Americans can vote in the actual Eurovision now - through the official app or by visiting here.\n\nIt can be. Abba (1974), Celine Dion (1988) and Olivia Newton-John (1974) went on to become global superstars after Eurovision. The contest has also helped sustain the careers of artists who've already made it, such as Michael Ball (1992), Cliff Richard (1968) and Lulu (1969). And it has given boosts to performers in the later stages of their careers (Katrina and the Waves, Engelbert Humperdinck and Bonnie Tyler).\n\nM\u00e5neskin, the Italian winners from 2021, are now huge mainstream stars: they played London's O2 and Glastonbury last year. Sam Ryder, the UK's 2022 runner-up, has done pretty well for himself too. But for every artist who makes it, dozens don't.

It is time to bring the Eurovision back to Ireland and Bambie is the act to do it!\"\n\nCroatia's Baby Lasagna, another Eurovision 2024 favourite, also made it through with his techno-rock song \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\", along with Finland's Windows95Man.\n\nDelegates from Luxembourg, Serbia, Ukraine, Portugal, Lithuania, Finland and Cyprus are also through to the final.\n\nElsewhere on the night, the UK's entry, Years and Years singer Olly Alexander, delivered his first Eurovision performance, which featured upside-down locker room staging.\n\nIt is the first time the UK has performed in a semi-final. Alexander, 33 has a guaranteed spot in the grand final as the UK is one of the \"big five\" countries that make the biggest contributions to the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nThe singer has come under intense pressure to boycott the competition in recent months due to Israel's involvement, which many Eurovision fans have objected to due to the country's ongoing war on Gaza.\n\nAlexander said in a

This year's Eurovision theme is \"The Eurovision Lights,\" which the organization defines as, \"a concept based on simple linear gradients, inspired by the vertical lines that permeate both the Northern lights and sound equalizers.\" Some of the names on the lineup this year include U.K. entry Olly Alexander of the band Years & Years, Windows95Man from Finland (last year's runner up), Baby Lasagna, Nemo, the Swiss entry with a ballad/rap/dance mashup that had audiences buzzing during qualifying.\n\nThe televised competition will have semi-finals on Tuesday, May 7 and Thursday, May 9, followed by the Grand Final on Saturday, May 11.

Each vote costs \u20ac0.99.\n\nOften compared to the Olympics (of music), Eurovision is a musical competition where artists from 37 European countries compete with original songs from all genres. The public vote on which artist -- and subsequent country they are representing -- will win.\n\nThe song-filled spectacle is typically watched by around 160 million people. It is the world's most-watched non-sporting event and is surpassed in audience only by the Olympics and the World Cup.\n\nThe 2024 competition will be held in last year's winner's home country, and this year, that's Sweden! This year's contest will take place in the city of Malm\u00f6.\n\nMalin \u00c5kerman and Petra Mede will host the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nLast year, Sweden took home the prize for best song, represented by the artist Loreen with her ballad \"Tattoo.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_&_Years", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Years & Years"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aurora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mashup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malin_Akerman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malin Akerman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra_Mede", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petra Mede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QAszjKNXYYFrQAwFfbSTzg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/44fa79e0-0c69-11ef-867f-6555b922da67", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 759, "textEnd": 764, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 779, "textEnd": 784, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 827, "textEnd": 833, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The IPBC is currently a member of the EBU, which allows Israel to continue to compete in Eurovision.\n\nOther non-European members of the EBU include Armenia, Cyprus and Australia - all of which are competing in Eurovision 2024.\n\nWhy has there been criticism of Israel's inclusion in Eurovision 2024?\n\nEurovision has faced criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current war in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"\n\nWho is representing Israel in Eurovision 2024?\n\nIsrael will be represented by Eden Golan, a 20-year-old singer who has risen to fame through various singing competitions, including the national talent competition Hakokhav HaBa (Rising Star).\n\nGolan will be performing Hurricane, a re-written version of previous entry October Rain, which was previously rejected by the EBU due to its political tones.\n\nIsrael's public broadcaster, Kan, initially refused to change the song, but Israel's President Isaac Herzog called for \"necessary adjustments\" to be made to ensure the country could participate in the competition.", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Public_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Broadcasting_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Broadcasting Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Eden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Eden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Herzog", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Herzog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Contests", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2023/05/eden-golan-322049f.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Palestine are not competing in this year's competition but Israel - located in the Middle East - are - something that has caused controversy over recent months.\n\nFollowing Saade's performance and choice of attire, a spokesperson for the EBU said: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show. All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nWriting on his Instagram Stories after his performance, Saade told his followers: \"Reminder: It's only love. United by music it is. [love heart emoji.].\" The official slogan for this year's Eurovision Song Contest is \"United By Music\". Saade has been flooded with support online in the wake of the EBU's statement condemning his keffiyeh print scarf.\n\n\"Eric gave a statement to Swedish news that I thought was really well said so I have translated it to the best of my ability,\" one Twitter (X) wrote on the microblogging site on Wednesday, sharing a screenshot of Saade's alleged comments in both Swedish and their translation into English.\n\nThe Twitter user's translation reads: \"I got this scarf from my father as a little boy, to never forget where our family is from. Back then I didn't know that it would one day be called a 'political symbol. It's like calling \"Dalah\u00e4sten\" (a traditional Swedish horse statue) a political symbol. In my eyes it's only racism. I just wanted to be including and wear something that felt real to me - but the EBU seem to think that my ethnicity is controversial. It says nothing about me, but everything about them. I say like this year's ESC-slogan: United by music.\"\n\nThe EBU's statement prompted a strong backlash online from those supporting the BDS boycott of the Eurovision Song Contest. \"Eurovision is about being 'United by Music' and sharing cultures from all around the world, except if you are Palestinian apparently,\" one wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"Palestinian flags have been banned but 8 months into a genocide, Israel is competing. If you're still watching Eurovision, you are revealing much about yourself and none of it good #BoycottEurovision,\" another added, with a third declaring: \"When you've seen nothing but brutally murdered children all over the Timeline for the last 24 hours, but the big News story is that a performer dared to wear a keffiyeh bracelet on the Eurovision stage.\"\n\nUK entry Olly Alexander has been criticised by some for not respecting the boycott\n\nIsrael being on the list of countries for Eurovision 2024 has caused controversy over recent months, following Israel's relentless attacks on Palestine. Lots of long-time fans of the music contest have been asking why Israel hasn't been kicked out of the competition like Russia was in 2022, after Russian leader Vladimir Putin invaded neighbouring country Ukraine.\n\nSince Hamas attacked Israel on 7th October and took hostages, more than 35,000 Palestinians have been injured, meaning that over 100,000 people have now been killed or injured in the six months of Israel's offensive. At least a further 7000 are estimated to lie dead beneath the rubble.\n\nEven though Israel isn't in Europe, it's been allowed to take part because the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) is a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Israel, located in the Middle East, first took part in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1973 and has won twice since then.\n\nUK entry Olly Alexander - who signed a letter calling Israel an \"apartheid regime\" prior to being unveiled as the UK entry in December - has been heavily criticised by many fans and activists for not withdrawing from this year's Eurovision Song Contest and listening to the Palestinian call to follow the BDS boycott.\n\nIn October, Alexander showed solidarity with the people of Palestine and called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. The letter from LGBT charity Voices4London described Israel as an 'apartheid regime' which is trying to \"ethnically cleanse\" Palestine.\n\nSpeaking in BBC's documentary titled Olly Alexander's Road To Eurovision '24, Alexander tearfully addressed the backlash and explained his reasons for rejecting the calls for him to boycott. \"A lot of the contestants and myself have been having a lot of comments that are like 'You are complicit in a genocide by taking part in Eurovision' which is quite extreme. It's very extreme,\" the It's A Sin actor said, visibly emotional. \"I understand where that sentiment is coming from but I think it's not correct.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It's an incredibly complicated political situation, one that I'm not qualified to speak on. The backdrop to this is actual immense suffering. It's a humanitarian crisis, a war. It just so happens there's a song contest going on at the same time that I'm a part of.\"\n\nIn response to Alexander's teary interview, Queers For Palestine - an activist group - issued a statement telling the singer to \"consider his place in history\" and that it's \"not too late to do the right thing. The statement read: \"We share @ollyalexanderr 's upset. The European Broadcasting Union has failed him and other contestants by refusing to ban genocidal Israel.\n\n\"But by insisting that he knows better than Palestinians Olly Alexander again flaunts a colonial mentality. We reiterate our call on Olly Alexander to boycott Eurovision. Doing no harm to the Palestinian freedom struggle by refusing to be complicit in artwashing genocide is a profound ethical duty. Olly, it's not too late to do the right thing. This moment could define the rest of your life. Consider your place in history.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

In rehearsals the singer had body paint in Ogham script which translated to \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom\". The singer explained in a press conference that:\n\n\"It was very important for me because I'm pro-justice and pro-peace ... Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'Crown the Witch' only (which was an) order from the EBU\"\n\nThe EBU said in a statement that:\n\n\"The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n\"After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.\"\n\nHowever, despite attempts to limit messages, a member of the Australian performance was able to get a message onto the contest stage. Fred Leone revealed on Instagram that he added a 'Watermelon' to his body paint to call against genocide in Gaza.\n\nIn addition, Eric Saade who performed as part of the Opening Act for Eurovision 2024 was criticised by show Producers and the EBU for performing with a Palestinian shawl wrapped around his wrist.\n\nThe EBU said in a statement to SVT that:\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live program.

Croatia's Baby Lasagna had already become the bookmakers favourite to win this year with his catchy rock tune Rim Tim Tagi Dim. And musician Marko Purisic completely ruled the stage with his confident performance that had all the crowd singing along.\n\nBefore the votes were even cast many fans were already convinced that Croatia has victory in their sights.\n\nWhat, how, and why?\n\nRim Tim Tagi Dim had already gained attention for it's surreal lyrics including, \"I'm a big now/I'm going away and a sold my cow\" and \"Bye mum, by dad/Meow cat, please meow back.\" The title apparently the name of a folk dance from the small rural village where he is from, and the song tells the story of small town boy, leaving Croatia in search of a better life. Baby Lasagna performed in a take on Croatian national dress including a lace shirt, leather waistcoat and voluminous trousers.\n\nThe crowd could be heard singing along to the chorus, shouting out the refrain of \"whoa\" and the applause was undeniably impressive. Fans on social media were already calling this year's Eurovision winner a done deal.\n\nOne wrote on social media platform X: \"Oh my god the audience. In case there were any doubts that this wouldn't win the televote, there's confirmation right there #Eurovision\" Another said: \"Croatia...it's going to win isn't it? I totally get it! Well done! #Eurovision2024\" Another posted: \"Okay i'm convinced, he is winning #Eurovision\" And another shared: \"Croatia - this song is so nuts but catchy as, love it #Eurovision\"\n\nIreland's act Bambie Thug literally danced with the devil during her performance. The self-proclaimed witch appeared to have recovered from the bout of food poisoning which saw them admitted to hospital on Friday 3 May. Bambie Robinson, 31, blamed their illness on \"bad shellfish\" saying it was \"both ends, gross and horrible\". But they drove the crowd wild with their rendition of ouija-pop song Doomsday Blue and fans were sharing #CrownTheWitch on social media.\n\nFormer Irish Eurovision act Jedward posted: \"Vote @Bambiethug in Eurovision! #CrownTheWitch Ireland\"\n\nCyprus singer Silia Kapsis was the very first act of the contest to perform. She is the youngest contestant at just 17 but wowed with her confidence as she sang Liar, giving many viewers Britney Spears vibes.\n\nWhat else happened in the first Eurovision Semi-Final?\n\nYears and Years singer Olly Alexander gave his first performance in the competition, showcasing the UK song entry Dizzy. The staging saw Alexander appear to dance upside down on the ceiling of a room thanks to the clever staging. The singer told UK presenters Rylan and Scott Mills that he was excited to perform the song for the first time in \"actual Eurovision\" but was feeling less pressure in the semi-final as he knew he was guaranteed a place in the final. Alexander said: \"I'm just going to enjoy it.\"\n\nEach semi-final will see 10 countries qualify and join hosts Sweden and the 'big five' nations of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK in Saturday night's final. While a jury decides points awarded by each county in the grand final, only viewers watching at home choose which acts from the semi-finals go through. Viewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 are eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. So UK viewers were able to vote in the first semi-final but will not be able to vote in the second on Thursday evening. As always you can not vote for your own country. Voting opened after the last song has been performed, and will stay open for approximately 15 to 25 minutes.\n\nThe next Eurovision 2024 Semi-Final will air on BBC One at 8pm on Thursday 9 May. The Eurovision Grand Final takes place on Saturday 11 May.\n\nRead more: Eurovision", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

However, from these 26, six countries do not need to take part in either semi-final and automatically get to take part at the weekend.\n\nThe first country that automatically qualifies this year is Sweden. As they won the 2023 contest in Liverpool with Loren and her song Tattoo they get a free pass into the final as they are hosting the competition at Malmo Arena.\n\nREAD MORE: When and where Eurovision Song Contest 2024 is taking place\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK also get to compete in Saturday's final without having to qualify. This is because these are the group of countries that make the biggest financial contributions to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) which owns and operates Eurovision.\n\nAs a result in 2000, a rule was created that allowed them direct entry into the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. This means they will also get to sing in the final without having to qualify in the semi-final.\n\nThe semi-finals will take place on Tuesday, May 7 and Thursday, May 9, with the final on Saturday, May 11. All three live programmes - both Semi Finals and the Grand Final - will once again be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_coyle@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Simon Coyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC iPlayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29120232.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Nebulossa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1320, "textEnd": 1325}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1340, "textEnd": 1345}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1375, "textEnd": 1381}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The Absolutely Fabulous actress, 78, will reveal what points the UK national jury gave to the other contestants during the competition's grand final. Dame Joanna follows in the footsteps of comedian and Doctor Who star Catherine Tate, Britain's Got Talent star Amanda Holden, TV chef Nigella Lawson, comedian Mel Giedroyc and Pointless star Richard Osman.\n\nThe contest format comprises three live shows. The main rules relating to competing songs and artists are that songs must be original and no more than three minutes in length; lead vocals must be performed live; and no more than six performers can take to the stage during any performance. Here's the lowdown on when to watch and how to vote.\n\nWhen are the Eurovision 2024 semi-finals?\n\nAhead of the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final at the weekend, there are two semi-finals. These are on Tuesday, May 7, and Thursday, May 9.\n\nAt the first semi-final on Tuesday, 15 countries will perform - these are Cyprus, Serbia, Lithuania, Ireland, Ukraine, Poland, Croatia, Iceland, Slovenia, Finland, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Australia, Portugal and Luxembourg. At the second semi-final on Thursday, another 16 will give their all on stage - Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czechia, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands.\n\nAt each semi-final, 10 countries are chosen to go forward to the Grand Final, meaning that 11 countries will be kicked out of the competition at this stage so this is your only chance to see those entrants perform live. The 20 finalists that are picked in these early heats will be joined in the Grand Final by another six countries who go straight through - these consist of 2023 winners Sweden plus the Big Five of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, whose broadcasters make the biggest financial contribution towards the contest each year.\n\nWhen is the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final?\n\nThe Eurovision 2024 Grand Final takes place on Saturday, May 11. The semi-finals and grand final all take place in the Malmo Arena, Sweden, following Swedish singer Loreen's win in Liverpool in 2023. We'll see a total of 26 countries perform on Saturday night.\n\nThis year, in a change from the usual procedure, the Big Five (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK) and host country Sweden will perform in the semi-finals as part of the show even though they are already pre-qualified for the Grand Final and no one can vote for them at this stage.\n\nHow to watch Eurovision 2024\n\nIn the UK, the TV schedule for Eurovision 2024 is as follows:\n\nEurovision 2024 Semi-Final 1 is being screened on BBC1 from 8pm to 10.20pm on Tuesday, May 7. Eurovision 2024 Semi-Final 2 is being screened on BBC1 from 8pm to 10.10pm on Thursday, May 9. Eurovision 2024 Grand Final is being screened on BBC1 from 8pm to 11.55pm on Saturday, May 11.\n\nYou can also watch Eurovision on BBC iPlayer and the official Eurovision YouTube channel.\n\nHow to vote in Eurovision 2024\n\nDuring the semi-finals you can only vote in the heat your country is taking part in, or the one that's been assigned to your country if viewing from Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the UK, or Sweden. You can vote up to 20 times for your countries of choice.\n\nIn the Grand Final, viewers in the UK will see numbers come up on screen and will then be able to vote by phone or text message. You can also participate via the official Eurovision Song Contest app, where you get live information about the participants and will be able to rank your favourites as well as vote. After voting via the app you are sent a video message from your favourite contestant.\n\nAt the Grand Final, voting for viewers in participating countries will open just before the first song is performed and remain open until 25 to 40 minutes after the last song. In the semi-finals, voting will open after the last song has been performed and will stay open for approximately 15 to 25 minutes.\n\nViewers in non-participating countries - such as the USA for instance - will have nearly 24 hours to vote for their favourite songs, split across two voting windows. Online voting will open for these countries at approximately midnight Central European Summer Time (or CEST, currently an hour ahead of the UK) on the day of each semi-final and Grand Final, and will initially stay open until the live shows begin.\n\nIn the semi-finals, voting in non-participating countries will reopen after the last song has been performed and will stay open for approximately 15 to 25 minutes. At the Grand Final, it reopens just before the first song is performed, and will remain open until 25 to 40 minutes after the last song.\n\nIn each show, after all songs have been performed, each country will give two sets of points (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12) to their favourite songs. The first set comes from a jury of five music industry professionals in each country and is then followed by points allocated after adding up all the public votes. You cannot vote for your own country.\n\nAt the end of the Grand Final, the song that has received the most points wins the iconic trophy and the winners are then brought back on stage to perform once more.\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp. Join our dedicated community to get the latest updates.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham

A group of fanatics, adorned in sequins and sparkles inspired by the competition, arrived at Copenhagen airport before making their way to the venue in Malmo ahead of the semi-final.\n\nThe die-hard fans hopped on an easyJet flight, the official airline of the contest, from London Gatwick at the break of dawn which quickly turned into a singalong to kickstart the party. The flight boasted a dedicated themed baggage drop, fancy dress, and a talent show at 40,000 feet, hosted by Drag Race star Tia Kofi.\n\nOne of the Eurovision enthusiasts who made the journey said: \"The flight laid on for us today was the ultimate treat for any Eurovision fan who loves to celebrate the glitz, glamour, and unity of Eurovision. I can't believe what an amazing experience it's been so far, and we haven't even left the airport yet.\"\n\nThis comes after a survey found that six and a half million Brits will be attending a Eurovision party this year. More than a third (35%) of the 2,000 adults surveyed will be tuning into the singing contest this year, with 36% of those either hosting their own festivities or celebrating at someone else's home.\n\nAnd one in five will be dressed in iconic Eurovision looks - with D'Nash, the 2007 Spanish entrant, Brotherhood of Man, the UK winners of 1976, and Ireland's 2021 entrant, Jedward, being the most popular.\n\nBelarus' 3 + 2, iconic Swedish band ABBA and Celine Dion's 1974 entry for France are among the outfits that closely follow in popularity. In addition to dressing up, 38% of fans will serve food inspired by the competing countries, such as Italy, Spain, and Greece.\n\nEurovision fans flight from London Gatwick to Copenhagen, hosted by the Official Airline Partner of the Eurovision Song Contest, easyJet.\n\nMichael Brown, director of cabin services at easyJet, expressed his pride in being part of the Eurovision phenomenon, stating: \"We are proud to be part of the Eurovision phenomenon, providing a glittering platform for fans to start their Eurovision journey. Our Super Fan Flight to Copenhagen promises to be a memorable adventure - a high-flying act of its own.\"\n\n\"The flight laid on for us today was the ultimate treat for any Eurovision fan who loves to celebrate the glitz, glamour, and unity of Eurovision. Our mission is to connect people and cultures together, and we're proud to be the Official Airline of the Eurovision Song Contest who share this passion.\"\n\nThe study also revealed that 39% of respondents love the Eurovision song contest, with 23% becoming bigger fans after Liverpool hosted the event last year.\n\nThe songs (31%), commentary (24%) and the outfits (21%) were cited as the top reasons for their love of the contest. Furthermore, 27% have been inspired to visit new countries because of Eurovision, with Italy, Greece and Spain topping the list.\n\nIt was also found that 42 would enjoy being in the live audience due to the sense of unity between nations (21%), celebrating diversity (19%) and being around like-minded people (12%).\n\nWhen it comes to the UK's entry this year, 64% don't think we are likely to win, with 43% attributing this to our poor track record.

We hope that many people will come from Denmark to participate,\" Per-Olof Karlsson, one of the organisers, told the broadcaster.\n\nWhen asked why he felt it was important to stage such a protest, he said: \"Because Israel should be excluded from Eurovision just like they did with Russia.\"\n\nIn solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and as part of a protest, an alternative music event called Falastinvision will be held on the final day of the Eurovision Song Contest on 11 May in Malmo.\n\nMany artists from Sweden and other parts of Europe will participate to show their support for Palestinians.\n\nREAD: Palestine pop singer favourite to represent Iceland in Eurovision\n\nAuthorities have requested additional security measures, such as submachine gun-wielding police officers and reinforcements from Denmark and Norway.\n\nMalmo, Sweden's third largest city, is home to approximately 360,000 people from 186 different nationalities, including a sizable Palestinian and Muslim population.\n\nIn 2022, Russia was barred from competing in the Eurovision held in the Italian city of Turin after neighbouring Finland threatened to pull its performer out unless it was banned due to Moscow's decision to invade Ukraine that year.\n\nThe EBU prevented the country from participating in future competitions.\n\nIceland was fined by the EBU after its Eurovision act, Hatari, raised Palestinian flags during their appearance on the show held in Israel in 2019.\n\nIn December, the Board of the Icelandic Society of Authors and Composers (FTT) publicly called on Iceland's public broadcaster, RUV, not to take part in the song contest \"unless Israel is denied participation in the competition on the same grounds as Russia in the last competition,\" FTT's General Director, Stefan Eiriksson, said in a letter sent to RUV.\n\n\"We all have a duty to take a stand against war and the killing of civilians and innocent children,\" Eiriksson said.\n\nHe emphasised that individuals and states \"always have the choice not to put our name to such things.\"\n\n\"We owe it to those nations that act with force through military might not to share the stage in an event that is always characterised by joy and optimism,\" added Eiriksson.", "source": {"uri": "middleeastmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Details on the grand prize", "body": "The song contest will air on BBC and consists of two semi-finals and a final show\n\nEurovision 2024 is in full swing! As acts from 37 competing countries take to the stage, fans from all over the world will vote for their favourite artists. But, of course, only 10 countries from each semi-final will go through to the grand finale on Saturday 11 May. Ever wondered what the winner of Eurovision actually gets? We've got the lowdown...\n\nWhat does the winner of Eurovision get?\n\nAs is tradition, the winner of Eurovision does not take home a cash prize. According to the song contest's official website: \"The song that has received the most points wins the iconic trophy and is performed once more.\"\n\nThe described trophy is essentially a glass 1950s-style microphone based on Kjell Engman's design. It has been given to every Eurovision winner from 2008 onwards, starting with Dima Bilan, who represented Russia. The Eurovision website also states that: \"The winning country will traditionally be given the honour of hosting the next Eurovision Song Contest.\"\n\nThis year, both semi-finals and the finale will take place at Malm\u00f6 Arena in Sweden. Handling the BBC's coverage of Eurovision 2024 will be Graham Norton, Scott Mills, Rylan Clark and Richie Anderson.\n\nWhile the winners do not receive any financial reward for Eurovision, historically they have gone on to receive great fame and recognition around the world. In particular, this was the case for Sweden's 1974 representatives from the supergroup ABBA - who went on to become one of the best-selling acts in pop music history.\n\nBucks Fizz and C\u00e9line Dion also shot to fame after winning in 1981 and 1988, respectively. Today, C\u00e9line has an estimated net worth of $800 million.\n\nIn 2022, the UK's representative Sam Ryder - who was crowned the runner-up - also enjoyed unparalleled success. After becoming a national hero for turning around the UK's losing streak, the singer went on to perform his hit song 'Space Man' at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.\n\nHis entry also resulted in him landing his first chart entry on the UK Singles Chart, which became the highest-charting UK Eurovision entry since Gina G's 'Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit' in 1996. In a historic moment, Sam has even become the first ever Eurovision act to be nominated for Best New Artist at the 2023 Brit Awards.", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_bull@hellomagazine.com", "name": "Megan Bull", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Anderson_(presenter)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richie Anderson (presenter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylan_Clark-Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rylan Clark-Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6 Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graham Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dima_Bilan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dima Bilan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_Awards_2023", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brit Awards 2023"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_Aah..._Just_a_Little_Bit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ooh Aah...

I have always liked Eurovision and to be a part of this fantastic show together with Petra is a dream come true. Additionally, Petra is one of the funniest women I've ever met,' she said.\n\nRepresenting the UK this year is Olly Alexander, who has already found global success as the frontman of band Years & Years, who have had three successful albums (two of which hit number 1 in the UK album chart) and 10 UK top 40 singles.\n\nHowever, he's now striking out on his own, with his appearance at Eurovision marking his first solo venture.\n\nOlly co-wrote his Eurovision entry Dizzy with Danny L Harle, who also co-wrote and produced Dua Lipa's Houdini.\n\nHe previously explained how the song was 'about feeling such an intense swell of emotion for someone they totally turn your world upside down and inside out'.\n\nThe performer has also appeared on screen, starring in Russell T Davies' It's A Sin, a brilliant and devastating drama about a group of friends living under the shadow of the AIDS crisis, which won a National Television Award.\n\nAll three live programmes - both Semi-Finals and the Grand Final - will once again be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.\n\nThe Semi-Finals will take place on May 7 and 9 with the Grand Final on Saturday, May 11.\n\nOver on BBC Radio 2 and BBC Sounds, Richie Anderson will be taking the reins for the first time and will be leading the commentary on the airwaves.\n\nAhead of the big event, Switzerland is currently the favourite to win this year's Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nThey are followed by Croatia, the Netherlands, Italy, Ukraine, Israel, France, Greece and Ireland, with the UK rounding out the top 10.\n\nThe Eurovision Song

(Credit: Frank Barratt/Keystone/Getty Images)\n\nA vital moment in democracy is nearly upon us. A vote that may change the course of history.\n\nI am speaking, of course, of Eurovision. This week is the 68th annual iteration of this trans-European, balls-to-the-wall original pop song competition. Musical acts from 37 countries have descended upon Malm\u00f6, Sweden, their platform shoes, laser fog machines, and disco-ball underpants in tow. They are here to vie for top place before an official panel of judges from the competing nations, and before us, the voting public.\n\nWho will emerge triumphant? It's anyone's game (except for Moldova's, probably). A lot of strategy and science go into crafting a winning Eurovision entry, including everything from song selection competitions, international politicking, and occasionally some good old-fashioned cheating.\n\nTo give you some sense of what to expect at the Grand Final on Saturday, I've analyzed the 10 entries considered most likely to win by EurovisionWorld.com, which aggregates the odds across 16 of the top bookmarking websites. Starting with...\n\n10. U.K.: \"Dizzy,\" by Olly Alexander\n\n\"Dizzy\" is an appealing, if fairly middle-of-the-road, house-influenced radio-pop song. I've been a casual fan of Olly Alexander's since his appearance in God Help the Girl, the feature film directorial debut of Stuart Murdoch, lead singer of Belle & Sebastian. So there's plenty to recommend this entry. That said, it is not going to win Eurovision. The U.K. hasn't won since 1997, and that's not going to change this year.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled over why the U.K. flops at Eurovision. One theory is that they don't send good acts to Eurovision because they don't need to. Along with France, Spain, Germany, and Italy, the U.K. is one of the \"Big Five\" -- the countries who make the largest financial contributions to the contest and who therefore automatically qualify for the finals. This reeks of payola, but whatever. They are essentially the permanent members of Eurovision's Security Council.\n\nAnother theory is that the U.K. is too classy and important to bother sending good acts to Eurovision. As Nick Duerden wrote for The Guardian, \"It's possible, of course, that we've always felt a little superior, culturally, to our European neighbours. If Eurovision is ultimately a kitsch fest, then we'll only ever proffer a little kitsch of our own.\"\n\nIn other words, Britain thinks it's too good for Eurovision. In The Spectator, Fraser Nelson wrote, \"Perhaps because we have the best musicians in Europe, arguably the world, we don't really try in Eurovision: seeing it as the equivalent of a musical bad-taste party rather than recognising it as a genre -- schlager -- loved by millions worldwide. We fail because we don't really try.\"\n\nBut among ordinary Britons, the preferred explanation for the U.K.'s underperformance is, as my British friend Will said, \"People hate us.\"\n\n\"We're not bad at Eurovision,\" my other British friend Hannah told me. \"It's all prejudice.\" In this version of the story, the U.K. would triumph if only the rest of Europe would stop punishing them for things like Brexit and so on.\n\nIf this sounds political, that's because it is. As you'll see as we keep going through the top 10 entries, Eurovision is not a \"vote for your favorite European nation\" contest, but it's not not a \"vote for your favorite European nation\" contest, either.\n\n9. Greece: \"Zari,\" by Marina Satti\n\nThis music video starts out with what looks like the opening scene from Love Actually, then proceeds to follow Satti as she sings mostly in Greek (with the occasional English interjection like \"Put your hands up!\") and dances around the Acropolis and other tourist sites.\n\nSatti's music has been compared to Spanish artist Rosal\u00eda, if that gives you some sense of what to expect. The zurna plays a prominent role in \"Zari,\" which may be why someone on Reddit described this one as \"one of the top Marmite entries of the year.\" (That's British slang for \"either you love it or you hate it.\") Personally, I don't like Marmite -- but I'm American, so this is not a surprise.\n\nThat leads me to one of my key talking points on Eurovision: Americans -- including me, and potentially you too -- are not the target audience. I'm not saying we shouldn't watch or enjoy or get way too passionate about arguing that Gina G. was robbed. I'm just saying that this event is not designed for us. If a Eurovision entry is not to my liking, I do not take that to mean that it's an inferior song so much as that I am an unqualified judge of pan-European tastes. I am an outsider observing a culture that is not designed for my approval, and that's okay!\n\n2024 will be only the second year that viewers outside of the participating countries are able to vote in the Eurovision finals. Why are they giving me and my fellow countrymen any say in this matter? A Eurovision spokesperson told NPR that the reason why they've opened up worldwide voting is \"to remain relevant and exciting,\" by which I think they mean \"to make more money.\" (Each vote costs \u20ac.99.)\n\n8. Israel: \"Hurricane,\" by Eden Golan\n\nThis entry is an English-language ballad that gives me Adele vibes. The challenge of ballads is that they don't naturally include the explosions of fire and glitter that make Eurovision the kitsch spectacle of the year. Instead, with \"Hurricane\" we get a crew of modern dancers -- which is not nothing, to be clear, but it's not literal fire, either.\n\nGolan has been around the Eurovision circuit for nearly a decade now, having competed in Junior Eurovision when she was 12. She did not win then, and it's highly unlikely that she will win now; many countries have called for Israel to be banned from this year's contest due to the ongoing war in Gaza. Even assuming the performance goes on as planned, there are very likely to be countries who won't vote for Israel's entry regardless of Golan's performance quality.\n\nFinally, some fire! This music video starts out with burning candles and a handmade book entitled \"BLAZE BIBLE,\" so right away we know what we're in for. Bambie Thug's visual aesthetic is goth, their musical aesthetic is screaming, and their physical aesthetic is writhing.\n\nI listened to \"Doomsday Blue\" three times and still had no idea what musical genre to place it in, which seemed like something I should figure out before publishing an article about it in SPIN. Eventually I asked the Internet and discovered that Bambie Thug has coined the term \"Ouija-pop\" to describe their music. Of course they have.\n\n6. France: \"Mon Amour,\" by Slimane\n\nThis is another Big Five entry, and a love ballad to boot. (I do not speak French, but most of the song's three minutes are taken up by Slimane crooning \"mon amour\" and \"je t'aime\" while a piano plays in the background, so even I could figure out the gist.)\n\nFrance's last Eurovision win came in 1977, but I guess enough bookmakers believe 2024 could be their comeback that they've made it onto this Top 10 list. According to science, slow songs about love are disproportionately likely to win Eurovision, so maybe this really will be France's year... but for my personal tastes, I'd prefer three minutes of nightmarish ouija-pop over a doleful man asking us to love him.\n\n5. Netherlands: \"Europapa,\" by Joost Klein\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is what Eurovision is all about: a man sporting shoulder pads as broad as wings, singing a 2 Unlimited-inspired gabber song that seems to be about the importance of the European Union but is also, somehow, about his dad.\n\n\"Europapa\" -- which translates to \"Eurodaddy\" -- starts out with an impassioned cry (\"Europe, let's come together! It's now or never! I love you all!\") while the music video depicts a flock of birds, Dutch windmills, and the EU flag flapping in the wind. Klein goes on to namecheck escargots, fish and chips, and paella (presumably courting votes from France, England, and Spain, respectively). At one point a background dancer does a backflip, and by the end everything is literally on fire. That's Eurovision, baby!\n\n4. Italy: \"La Noia,\" by Angelina Mango\n\nThe most notable thing about this music video is that Angelina Mango has SO MUCH HAIR. It's absolutely miles of hair. If her hair were a highway system, you would get lost in it and never find your exit.\n\nMusically, this is a catchy, cumbia-inspired pop song whose lyrics are almost entirely in Italian, except for one small part where she rhymes \"princess\" with \"business.\" The title, \"La Noia,\" translates to \"The Boredom,\" though I would not describe this as a boring song. (It is not, for example, a ballad.)\n\nI know what you're wondering, though. \"Will there be fire?\" Do not fear. While the music video includes little to no fire, Mango's rehearsals suggest plenty of pyrotechnics.\n\n3. Ukraine: \"Teresa & Maria,\" by Alyona Alyona & Jerry Heil\n\nThis music video starts out with Jerry Heil sporting a pair of extremely wide-legged pants and singing in Ukrainian about Mother Teresa and the Virgin Mary. It's an emotional pop song with a heavy beat. Halfway through, Alyona Alyona jumps in with an entirely unexpected (to me) rap break. While the genre has turned on a dime, we're still sticking close to the matter at hand -- i.e. Mother Teresa.\n\nUkraine last won Eurovision in 2022, a few months after Russia's invasion. These two events are not unconnected. Russia, meanwhile, has been banned from competing in Eurovision for the past three years. It's not likely that Ukraine will log another win so soon after their last one, but it's not impossible either. The last time we saw anything like that was in the mid-1990s, when Ireland dominated four out of five consecutive years. History shows it can be done!\n\n2. Switzerland: \"The Code,\" by Nemo\n\nThis song cycles between operatic singing and rap, with some techno beats in the background. Its multi-genre tour makes it a solid pick in your Eurovision bets. (I once again was surprised by this rap break, which is a real \"fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me\" situation.) The music video features multiple costume changes in rapid succession, which bodes well. Overall, I got some strong Mika vibes -- which also seems promising, considering that Mika co-hosted Eurovision 2022.\n\nNemo's Wikipedia entry states, \"On the second season of The Masked Singer Switzerland in 2021/2022, Nemo was unmasked as a panda and finished in fifth place.\" The phrasing of this statement strongly implies that Nemo, rather than being a human adult, is in fact secretly a panda whose true identity has been previously unmasked and may yet be unmasked again. Here's hoping that 2024 is the first year a panda wins Europe's foremost musical competition.\n\n1. Croatia: \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim,\" by Baby Lasagna\n\nOkay, I understand why this song is the odds-on favorite. The vocals are technically in English, but they sound like they're being performed by DJ Crazy Times. The music is a spasmodic mix of heavy metal, techno, and trap. The video prominently features a one-eyed cat, an olde-fashioned washerwoman, a guitarist and drummer wearing full-face white mesh masks, and of course fire.\n\nMeanwhile, the lyrics, which cleverly rhyme \"now\" with \"ciao\" and \"cow,\" also include such gems as \"Gonna miss my hay, gonna miss my bed, but most of all, I'mma miss the dance, so come on y'all, let us prance.\" Those lyrics might sound silly, but actually they are about young Croatians immigrating in search of economic opportunities. Bet you didn't see that coming! Each minute in this song does very little to prepare you for what might happen in the next minute, and that, as far as I'm concerned, is the mark of a worthy Eurovision entry.\n\nYou can (and should!) watch the Eurovision 2024 semifinals at 3 p.m. ET on May 7 and May 9, and the Grand Final at 3 p.m. ET on Saturday, May 11.

LUNA was the first Polish woman to be invited to take part.\n\n\ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf7 Croatia | Baby Lasagna - Rim Tim Tagi Dim\n\nBaby Lasagna says the craziest experience on his Eurovision journey was singing in front of thousands of fans at one of the pre-parties. As if that wasn't daunting enough, he also sang in front of K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4, of Cha Cha Cha fame, and has had the whole of Croatia doing the Rim Tim Tagi Dim dance. Next challenge, the whole of Europe.\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf8 Iceland | Hera Bj\u00f6rk - Scared of Heights\n\nHera has competed at the Eurovision Song Contest before, and she's got some great stories from that time. Just hours before her performance in the 2010 Eurovision Grand Final, Hera broke a tooth on a sweet. Thanks to a sprinkling of Eurovision luck, her dentist was in the audience, and even more luckily, they had some glue. Just in time for the show, Hera's tooth was back in her mouth. Someone please remove all chewy sweets from Hera's dressing room.\n\n\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddee Slovenia | Raiven - Veronika\n\nA lot of the Eurovision class of 2024 have pets, but Raiven's might be the most unusual. In keeping with the bird theme, she has a macaw called Georgie. Georgie is blue and yellow, which are of course the colours of Sweden's flag. One of her close friends, who happens to be Bojan from Joker Out, is terrified of Georgie.\n\n\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddee Finland | Windows95man - No Rules!\n\nOne huge inspiration for Windows95man is Gina G. She represented the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1996 with the song Ooh...Aah...Just A Little Bit and came in 8th place. He says it was the best show and the best Euro-dance.\n\n\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde9 Moldova | Natalia Barbu - In The Middle\n\nThis isn't Natalia's first time at the Eurovision Song Contest, and last time she landed in 10th place. She competed for Moldova in 2007 with the song Fight, and her performance included a fiery rock performance, scarf dancing, and impressively high notes. She's back fighting for a place in the Grand Final in 2024, and this time she's brought her violin.\n\n\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddff Azerbaijan | FAHREE feat. Ilkin Dovlatov - \u00d6z\u00fcnl\u0259 Apar\n\nFAHREE is certainly multi-talented. Until recently, he was pursuing a career in law, spending 6 years studying towards his Bachelor's and Master's degrees. He switched to a life of music, and on top of that he's a professional basketball player. Is there anything he can't do?!\n\n\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa Australia | Electric Fields - One Milkali (One Blood)\n\nElectric Fields singer Zaachariaha often sings in Yankunytjatjara, the language of the Anangu peoples, which is rooted in his culture. You'll hear Yankunytjatjara in Electric Fields' Eurovision song One Milkali (One Blood), making it the first time an Aboriginal language has been sung on the Eurovision stage.\n\n\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9 Portugal | iolanda - Grito\n\nThe strangest place that iolanda has ever performed is an outdoor climbing centre. And when she's finished her Eurovision Song Contest journey, she'll be heading back to Lisbon for a sold-out show - not in a climbing centre this time.\n\n\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddfa Luxembourg | TALI - Fighter\n\nLuxembourg hasn't competed in the Eurovision Song Contest since 1993, which means that TALI, who was born in 2000, has never actually seen a live performance of her country in Eurovision. She'll get to experience it this year, but live from the stage.\n\nYou can listen to all 37 songs of Eurovision 2024 via your favourite streaming service or watch the music videos on our YouTube

The group, decked out in sequins and sparkles inspired by the competition, landed at Copenhagen airport before making their way to the venue in Malmo for the semi-final.\n\nThe super fans hopped on an easyJet flight, the official airline of the contest, from London Gatwick at the break of dawn, which quickly turned into a singalong to kickstart the festivities. The flight boasted a themed baggage drop, fancy dress, and a talent show at 40,000 feet, hosted by Drag Race star Tia Kofi.\n\nOne of the Eurovision devotees who made the trip said: \"The flight laid on for us today was the ultimate treat for any Eurovision fan who loves to celebrate the glitz, glamour, and unity of Eurovision. I can't believe what an amazing experience it's been so far, and we haven't even left the airport yet.\"\n\nThis comes after a survey revealed that six and a half million Brits will be attending a Eurovision party this year. More than a third (35%) of the 2,000 adults surveyed will be tuning into the singing contest this year, with 36% of those either hosting their own parties or celebrating at someone else's house.\n\nAnd one in five will be dressed in iconic Eurovision outfits - with D'Nash, the 2007 Spanish entrant, Brotherhood of Man, the UK winners of 1976, and Ireland's 2021 entrant, Jedward, being the most popular.\n\nOutfits inspired by Belarus' 3 + 2, iconic Swedish band ABBA and Celine Dion's 1974 entry for France are among the top choices for Eurovision fans. In addition to dressing up, 38% of fans will serve food inspired by competing countries such as Italy, Spain, and Greece.\n\nMichael Brown, director of cabin services at easyJet, expressed his pride in being part of the Eurovision phenomenon, stating: \"We are proud to be part of the Eurovision phenomenon, providing a glittering platform for fans to start their Eurovision journey. Our Super Fan Flight to Copenhagen promises to be a memorable adventure - a high-flying act of its own. Our mission is to connect people and cultures together, and we're proud to be the Official Airline of the Eurovision Song Contest who share this passion.\"\n\nResearch also revealed that 39% of respondents love the Eurovision song contest, with 23% becoming bigger fans after Liverpool hosted the event last year. The songs (31%), commentary (24%) and outfits (21%) were cited as the top reasons for their fandom. Furthermore, 27% have been inspired to visit new countries because of Eurovision, with Italy, Greece and Spain topping the list.\n\nIt was also found that 42 would enjoy being in the live audience due to the sense of unity between nations (21%), celebrating diversity (19%) and being around like-minded people (12%). However, when it comes to the UK's entry this year, 64% don't think we are likely to win, with 43% attributing this to our poor track record. However, a third of the respondents believe that 'Dizzy' by Olly Alexander is the best song we've put forward in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "esti_pujana@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Esti Pujana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tia_Kofi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tia Kofi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatwick_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gatwick Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Man", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedward", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jedward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brit Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celine Dion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/music/article32752287.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_easyJet_Eurovision_007JPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.615686274509804, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Participating artists have faced pressure to pull out of the Eurovision event as a way to boycott Israel's involvement, and Israel's representative in the contest, Eden Golan, has reportedly received death threats. Israel also increased the threat level for traveling to Malmo in response to threats of potential terrorist attacks that could target Israelis visiting the city for the Eurovision.\n\nDe Tender told Sky News that when the governing bodies of the EBU, which is a member-led organization, reviewed Israel's involvement in this year's Eurovision, they concluded that the Israeli public broadcaster Kan had \"met all of the obligations\" listed in the competition's rules that would allow them to take part in the Eurovision. The circumstances were different regarding's Russia's involvement in the Eurovision competition, De Tender added.\n\n\"With Russia there was a broad consensus within the membership of the EBU that they could not participate,\" he said. In addition, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and amid the ongoing war between the two countries, the three Russian members of the EBU were removed for being in breach of member obligations.\n\n\"And that is not the case with Kan,\" De Tender explained. He said Eurovision steers clear of politics and that if the EBU would exclude Kan because of something outside of competition rules \"that would have been a political decision.\"\n\nGolan skipped the opening event of the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest on Sunday night to instead hold a small ceremony marking Holocaust Remembrance Day, which started that night in Israel.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.algemeiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-10T170321Z_1_LYNXNPEK390SV_RTROPTP_4_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-EUROVISION-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "dateEnd": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 458, "textEnd": 466}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1239, "textEnd": 1245}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The Ogham writing translated to ceasefire - a nod to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nA spokeswoman for the EBU said: 'The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n'After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.'\n\nThe 31-year-old singer has previously spoken to Metro.co.uk about Israel's inclusion in the competition, stating they don't agree with the EBU's decision.\n\nThe war against Hamas has killed more than 35,000 people in Palestine, and injured a further 77,000 in Gaza, according to figures obtained by Al Jazeera, however, the EBU have doubled down on their position to include Israel's act Eden Golan.\n\nIn a shared statement, the UK's entry Olly Alexander, and Bambie joined entrants from Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Switzerland, Denmark, Lithuania and Finland to say they do 'not feel comfortable being silent' and 'stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.'\n\nIt continued: 'We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.\n\n'We feel it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.'\n\nBambie, who will now be performing in the Grand Final on Saturday, said: 'We couldn't stay silent on the matter. I basically said what I wanted to say in my statement, but it is down to the EBU and it is down to even my broadcaster.\n\n'I'm getting a lot of targeted abuse that I don't think it's entirely fair, actually, when I'm not the one that's making the decisions, but I am extremely pro-Palestine and it is disappointing that the EBU has made this decision because I don't think it's correct.'\n\nThe non-binary Eurovision star has said they struggled with the backlash and horrific transphobic hate. 'It's a lot to take, from the transphobic abuse online and also just coming for my character in terms of this boycott thing,' they shared.\n\nEurovision has sparked backlash in recent months over including Israel in the Song Contest, with more than 2,000 artists from Iceland, Finland, and the host country Sweden signing open letters asking for Israel to be banned.\n\nJean Philip De Tender, Deputy Director General of the EBU, said: 'The European Broadcasting Union acknowledges the depth of feeling and the strong opinions that this year's Eurovision Song Contest - set against the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East - has provoked.\n\n'We understand that people will want to engage in debate and express their deeply held views on this matter. We have all been affected by the images, stories and the unquestionable pain suffered by those in Israel and in Gaza.'\n\nThe statement stated that they 'oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.'\n\n'This is unacceptable and totally unfair, given the artists have no role in this decision,' it explained.\n\nThe statement ended: 'The EBU is dedicated to providing a safe and supportive environment for all participants, staff, and fans of the Eurovision Song Contest. We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to promote the values of respect, inclusivity, and understanding, both online and offline.\n\n'We urge everyone to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue and support the artists who are working tirelessly - on what is a music and entertainment show - to share their music with the world.'\n\nStars including Dame Helen Mirren, Boy George and Sharon Osbourne signed an open letter supporting the country's inclusion after it was shared on non-profit body Creative Community For Peace, who campaign against cultural boycotts of Israel.\n\nBambie told a press conference in Malmo, Sweden, that they were completely 'disassociated' and having an 'out of body experience' after making the final.\n\nThe artist from County Cork, has said their inclusion in the contest is symbolic of 'progression'.\n\n'It shows that the people are a lot more forward-thinking,' they told BBC.\n\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris is amongst those celebrating Ireland's first final in six years.\n\n'Congratulations to Bambie Thug, who has qualified for the Eurovision final tonight,' he wrote on X.\n\n'Bambie will become the first Irish act in the Eurovision finals since 2018. It is time to bring the Eurovision back to Ireland and Bambie is the act to do it!'\n\nDespite their lack of success in recent years, Ireland is tied with Sweden as the country with the most overall wins - seven. Some Eurovision fans think they could do it again thanks to Bambie's mesmerising performance.\n\nIn the act, the independent artist dressed like a witch with horns on their head, screamed to the heavens and was twirled by a dancer wearing devil-inspired prosthetics.\n\nThe next Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Finals will air on Thursday, May 9, at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer. The Grand Final airs on Saturday, May 11, at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us

Here's everything you need to know.\n\nDuring the first semi-final, which airs tonight (Tuesday 7th May), Benjamin Ingrosso will perform a medley of his songs, followed by former Eurovision winner, Ireland's Johnny Logan.\n\nDuring the second semi-final, on Thursday 9th May, Petra Mede will be performing the song We Just Love Eurovision Too Much.\n\nWhile certain details of the interval acts for the Grand Final have been kept under lock and key, it was been confirmed that reigning champion Loreen will be returning to the Eurovision stage once more for an extra special performance.\n\nThere will also be exciting opening acts, who will open the show with epic performances ahead of each semi-final and final.\n\nEleni Foureira, Eric Saade and Chanel will all be performing the United By Music opening number for the first semi-final, followed by Helena Paparizou, Sertab Erener and Charlotte Perrelli in The World's Biggest Sing-Along.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katelyn_mensah@radiotimes.com", "name": "Katelyn Mensah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intermission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Ingrosso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Ingrosso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra_Mede", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petra Mede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Logan_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Logan (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Paparizou", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helena Paparizou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Saade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Saade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Perrelli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Perrelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertab_Erener", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sertab Erener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleni_Foureira", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eleni Foureira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chanel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/05/benjamin-ingrosso-33171eb.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 368, "textEnd": 375}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 537, "textEnd": 544}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

It's very extreme.\n\n\"I understand where that sentiment is coming from, but I think it's not correct.\"\n\nOlly continued: \"It's an incredibly complicated political situation [and] one that I'm not qualified to speak on. The backdrop to this is actual immense suffering. It's a humanitarian crisis - a war.\n\n\"You know, and it just so happens there's a song contest at the same time, that I'm a part of. People are like in despair and want to do something.\"\n\nBecoming tearful, Olly insisted: \"People should do what's right for them, if they want to boycott Eurovision, if they don't feel comfortable watching, that's their choice, and I respect that, you know?\n\n\"Eurovision is, you know, it's meant to be, like, an apolitical contest, but that's, like, a fantasy.\"\n\nOlly previously said in response to calls for him to pull out of the competition: \"I wholeheartedly support action being taken to demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the return of all hostages and the safety and security of all civilians in Palestine and Israel.\n\n\"I know some people will choose to boycott this year's Eurovision and I understand and respect their decision. As a participant I've taken a lot of time to deliberate over what to do and the options available to me. It is my current belief that removing myself from the contest wouldn't bring us any closer to our shared goal.\n\n\"Instead, I've been speaking with some of the other [Eurovision] contestants and we've decided that by taking part we can use our platform to come together and call for peace.\n\n\"I hope and pray that our calls are answered and there is an end to the atrocities we are seeing taking place in Gaza.\n\n\"I'd like to thank the many signatories of this letter whose work I deeply admire and respect and hope that we can continue to work together in creating a better world for all of us.\"\n\nBefore it was revealed he'd be representing the UK at Eurovision, Olly was one of more than 1,400 signatories on an open letter expressing solidarity with Palestine, and accusing Israel of \"genocide\" and referring to it as an \"apartheid state\".\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Eurovision bosses had taken issue with Israel's submitted song due to its supposedly \"political\" lyrics, with the country's national broadcaster Kan saying they would rather withdraw from the competition than change the song.\n\nHowever, the Israeli delegation later appeared to have had a change of heart, when it was confirmed last month that Eden Golan will be representing Israel in Sweden this weekend, with a rewritten version of her original song, now titled Hurricane, after being changed from October Rain.\n\nThe 2024 Eurovision Song Contest will be taking place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden all this week, following Loreen's historic victory last year.", "source": {"uri":

In my eyes it's only racism.\"\n\n\"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that felt real to me - but the EBU seem to think that my ethnicity is controversial. It says nothing about me, but everything about them. I say like this year's ESC-slogan: United by music.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to his performance, Eric branded the EBU's \"handling\" of this year's Eurovision \"disgraceful\", and wrote the slogan United By Music is \"a joke\".\n\nHe also claimed organisers \"do not permit any Palestinian symbols inside the arena\" while \"symbols representing any other ethnicity in the world are welcomed\".\n\nReports have claimed that since 2023, only flags of the competing countries, the European Union flag and the Pride flag are permitted inside a Eurovision venue.\n\nHuffPost UK has contacted the EBU for clarification on this.\n\nThis year's Eurovision Song Contest is taking place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, and has faced a backlash from some regular fans due to Israel's continued involvement, despite the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.\n\nAfter facing calls to withdraw from the competition in solidarity with Palestine, a number of acts - including the UK's own Olly Alexander - released a joint statement which read: \"In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"\n\nAfter the first semi-final on Tuesday, Irish act Bambie Thug claimed they'd also been made by the EBU to remove messages of solidarity with Palestine from their stage costume.\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Eurovision organisers had taken issue with Israel's submitted song due to its supposedly \"political\" lyrics, with the country's national broadcaster Kan saying they would rather withdraw from the competition than change the song.\n\nHowever, the Israeli delegation later appeared to have had a change of heart, after it was confirmed that Eden Golan would be representing Israel at the competition, with a rewritten version of her original song, now titled Hurricane, after being changed from October Rain.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This year's competition features 37 talented artists from across Europe and Australia, all vying for the coveted title of Eurovision champion.\n\nHowever, notable by its absence is Bulgaria, as the country did not field a representative for the 68th edition of the prestigious music event. With an annual viewership exceeding 150 million, Eurovision has become a cultural phenomenon celebrated by audiences worldwide. The culmination of this year's competition will be the final showdown on May 11, Saturday, at 10:00 p.m., which Bulgarian viewers can tune into via the Eurovision YouTube channel.\n\nBulgaria will miss an appearance for the second year in a row. The country was last represented at the contest in 2022 by the group \"Intelligent Music Project\" and their song \"Intetion\". The song failed to qualify for the final and finished second to last in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest. There is no comment from the Bulgarian National Television as to why the country will not participate, but in previous years the public television has justified its refusal with financial reasons.\n\nIn the lead-up to the final, all 37 contestants underwent rigorous rehearsals on the elaborate stage in Malm\u00f6. As anticipation builds, spectators and experts have been vocal about their favorites to clinch the coveted crystal microphone. Among the countries generating buzz as top contenders for victory are Croatia, France, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Greece, and Ireland.\n\nDespite Bulgaria's absence from this year's lineup, the Eurovision Song Contest promises to deliver a spectacular showcase of musical talent, creativity, and cultural diversity.

Let's take a look at a bookie's prediction.\n\nThe hot favourite to be crowned Eurovision Song Contest 204 winner is Croatai with their act, the brilliantly named, Baby Lasagna with their song Rim Tim Tagi Dim.\n\nTheir odds are considerably more favourable - at even money - than the second artist predicted to steal the competition, Switzerland's Nemo and song The Code (10/3).\n\nItaly is third most likely to win the night at 6/1, followed by Ukraine (10/1), The Netherlands (12/1) and Ireland (14/1), according to Ladbrokes.\n\nAlex Apati, from the betting firm, said: 'Ireland's chances of winning have taken a slight hit, with Croatia already beginning to pull away as clear favourites to win in Sweden.'\n\nIt is bad news, though, for the UK, with Ladbrokes giving Olly Alexander a 66/1 odds of winning compared to 5/1 finishing last. There is also a 12/1 chance of receiving the dreaded nil points.\n\n'It looks like it'll be yet another disappointing Eurovision year for the UK, with Olly Alexander now just 12/1 for a nil point night,' Alex summed up.\n\nThe UK is not Ladbrokes' least likely act to win, though. If you were a betting person it would be best not to place bets on the likes of Malta (500/1), Lativa (500/1), San Marino (300/1) and Portugal (300/1).\n\nIf Baby Lasagna does win the Eurovision, it will be the first time Croatia has won since joining the competition in 1993.\n\nTo date, the best placing for Croatia is fourth, which it achieved in 1996 and 1999.\n\nAfter the first semi-final last night, Eurovision fans had already decided that this year's 'underdog' deserves to be crowned champion.\n\nThey might not be the bookie's favourite but Ireland's Bambie Thug, who is non-binary, stole the show with their spelling-binding rendition of their songDoomsday Blue.\n\nThe performance - which had everything - saw the singer dress like a witch with horns on their head, scream to the heavens and be twirled by a dancer wearing devil-inspired prosthetics.\n\nBut don't just take out word for it.\n\nBambie Thug also set social media alive, with X user exclaiming: @axolotl2023: 'This was the most original performance we EVER had in the whole history of #Eurovision and im dead serious about it, im so speechless THIS NEEDS TO WIN ! #Ireland #CrownTheWitch #BambieThug #getoutofrafah #Eurovision #Eurovision2024.'\n\nAgreeing, @Mika_ljm stated: 'This just screams winner all over. They went from being an underdog to a likely top 10/top 5 result in the final! Congrats Ireland & Bambie Thug, you were amazing. And now... #CrownTheWitch in the final!'\n\n@PatrickMooney also said: 'Oh what a night. To witness Bambie Thug qualifying live in the arena was incredible. Well done SVT on a stunning show. The Witch has been Crowned! #Eurovision.'\n\nMetro.co.uk recently had the chance to speak to the artist, as they expressed their pride in having the chance to take part in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n'I'm an independent artist and other than this I would have never been put in front of so many people, so soon, unsigned or anything, so that's incredible,' they said.\n\n'I think it's a feat in itself to get there, and for us to be in the top 10 after my country not being in the top 10 or in the final for 10 years, and even just for the alt scene, and the queer scene and goths, it's great that we're there.\n\n'Seeing that the doors are opening for more not-so-Normcore music is really encouraging, and I've gotten a lot of love since being involved and people finding my art, finding my old songs and it's been a good boost because it is hard grinding this plane independently so I'm proud of myself regardless.'\n\nWho would you like to win?\n\nThe next Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Finals will air on Thursday, May 9, at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer. The Grand Final airs on Saturday, May 11, at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us

We hope that many people will come from Denmark to participate,\" Per-Olof Karlsson, one of the organizers, told the broadcaster.\n\nWhen asked why he felt it was important to stage such a protest, he said: \"Because Israel should be excluded from Eurovision just like they did with Russia.\"\n\nIn solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and as part of a protest, an alternative music event called Falastinvision will be held on the final day of the Eurovision Song Contest on May 11 in Malmo.\n\nMany artists from Sweden and other parts of Europe will participate to show their support for Palestinians.\n\nAuthorities have requested additional security measures, such as submachine gun-wielding police officers and reinforcements from Denmark and Norway.\n\nMalmo, Sweden's third largest city, is home to approximately 360,000 people from 186 different nationalities, including a sizable Palestinian and Muslim population.\n\nIn 2022, Russia was barred from competing in the Eurovision held in the Italian city of Turin after neighboring Finland threatened to pull its performer out unless it was banned due to Moscow's decision to invade Ukraine that year.\n\nThe EBU prevented the country from participating in future competitions.\n\nIceland was fined by the EBU after its Eurovision act Hatari raised Palestinian flags during their appearance on the show held in Israel in 2019.\n\nIn December, the board of the Icelandic Society of Authors and Composers (FTT) publicly called on Iceland's public broadcaster RUV not to take part in the song contest \"unless Israel is denied participation in the competition on the same grounds as Russia in the last competition,\" FTT's General Director Stefan Eiriksson said in a letter sent to RUV.\n\n\"We all have a duty to take a stand against war and the killing of civilians and innocent children,\" Eiriksson said.\n\nHe emphasized that individuals and states \"always have the choice not to put our name to such things.\"\n\n\"We owe it to those nations that act with force through military might not to share the stage in an event that is always characterized by joy and optimism,\" added Eiriksson. -",

The previous year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. There will be 26 acts in total in the final.\n\nThe world's biggest live music event, Eurovision Song Contest, will take place in Sweden in the second week of May with 37 participating countries. Roughly 100,000 visitors from 89 countries are expected in host city Malm\u00f6 during the week for the 68th edition of the competition.\n\nWHEN IS THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2024? The event kicked off on Tuesday with the first semi-final, and will be followed by a second semi-final on Thursday.\n\nThe Grand Final will be held on Saturday, May 11 at 1900 GMT. WHERE IS EUROVISION BEING HELD?\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 is taking place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden's third-largest city with a population of 362,000. The city also hosted Eurovision in 1992 and in 2013. Sweden has hosted Eurovision seven times in total, counting in 2024. Stockholm, the capital, hosted the competition in 1975, 2000, and 2016 and Gothenburg in 1985.\n\nThe concert venue is Malm\u00f6 Arena with a capacity of up to 15,500. HOW DOES VOTING WORK?\n\nViewers decide the results of the two semi-finals and can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or via a Eurovision app. Viewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 are eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nViewers in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 are eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain. In the final, audience votes will make up half of the result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country will make up the other half.\n\nThe juries will rank the songs based on composition and originality of the song, quality of the stage performance, the artists' vocal capacity, and their overall impression of the act. Each country will award points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12.\n\nNon-participating countries around the world will also be able to vote, and will collectively have the weight of one additional voting country. New to this year's Eurovision, viewers outside the participating countries can vote 24 hours prior each semi-final and the Grand final.\n\nWHO SECURED A SPOT IN THE GRAND FINAL FOLLOWING THE FIRST SEMI-FINAL? Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Ukraine\n\nThis means that Australia, Azerbaijan, Iceland, Moldova, and Poland did not make it through to the final. WHO WILL COMPETE IN THE SECOND SEMI-FINAL ON THURSDAY?\n\nMalta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands. WHO COMPETES IN THE GRAND FINAL?\n\nThe top 10 from each semi-final will participate in the final. The previous year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThere will be 26 acts in total in the final. WHY THE 'BIG FIVE'?\n\nThe \"Big Five\" countries are France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which bring the biggest financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Since 2000, these countries have secured themselves an automatic spot in the Grand Final.\n\nHOW TO WATCH IT The song contest will be broadcast by all 37 participating countries. It will also be streamed on YouTube.\n\nWHO IS THE FAVOURITE TO WIN EUROVISION? Bookmakers have Croatia, Switzerland and Ukraine as the top three favourites to win, while streaming data from Spotify suggests a strong chance for the Netherlands, Italy or host nation Sweden.\n\nWHO ARE THE PRESENTERS? The song contest will be presented by Swedish comedian and actress Petra Mede and Swedish-American actress Malin \u00c5kerman.\n\nEUROVISION HISTORY The Eurovision song contest is one of the world's largest television events, and has been held annually since 1956.\n\nEurovision features live music performances from most European countries and beyond, including Israel and Australia. Originally it started as a technical experiment for transnational broadcast television with only seven countries competing: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy.\n\nThe show reached 162 million people in 2023 through public service markets. WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE WON THE MOST EUROVISIONS?\n\nSweden and Ireland are leading with seven wins each. France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have each won five times, with the Netherlands as the most recent of the four countries to win in 2019. WHO WON LAST YEAR?\n\nSwedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool for the second time with her song \"Tattoo\". She is the only person after Ireland's Johnny Logan to win the contest twice.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nHe also noted the EBU, an apolitical member organisation, is \"in line\" with other international federations including sports bodies who are allowing Israel to participate in events.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nIn March, Alexander along with Irish hopeful Bambie Thug and other Eurovision artists released a joint statement, backing \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire\" but refusing to boycott the event.\n\nThat same month, Israel unveiled its new entry song as Hurricane, performed by singer Eden Golan.\n\nHer original track, October Rain, had caused controversy as the lyrics were thought to reference the Hamas attacks of October 7 before being changed following the backlash.\n\nOlly Alexander is the UK\u00b4s Eurovision entry this year (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\nDiscussing the backlash, De Tender said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan, which is the Israeli public broadcaster, met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\nIn 2022, EBU announced that Russia would no longer be participating in Eurovision following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA statement at the time said the EBU's executive board had made the decision following a recommendation by the Eurovision governing body, known as the reference group, based on \"the rules of the event and the values of the EBU\".\n\nOn Sunday, De Tender said the situation between Russia and Israel was \"different\" as in Russia's case there was a \"broad consensus within the membership of the EBU that they could not participate\".\n\nHe added that the three Russian members of the EBU had already been \"excluded\" from the EBU membership in the weeks after the war broke out due to breaching \"member obligations\".\n\nThe 37 Eurovision entries are set to perform across two semi-finals next week on Tuesday and Thursday in a bid to compete for a place in the grand final on Saturday.\n\nAlexander is set to perform his dance-infused track Dizzy on behalf of the UK during the Tuesday semi-final, but he is already through to the final along with the other members of the \"big five\" - France, Germany, Italy and Spain - as well as last year's winner Sweden, who get to go through automatically.\n\nDe Tender said the preparations are going \"very well\" as they have been planning the music spectacle in Sweden for the past year after Loreen won the competition with her hit song Tattoo.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

The broadcaster, 51, announced in 2021 that he was engaged to boyfriend of four years Sam and in an exclusive chat with OK!, Scott has revealed that he's \"feeling the pressure\" ahead of his nuptials this year.\n\n\"Planning is going really well, it's really near now,\" he said. \"It's a summer wedding. I think we're worked out all the logistics of everything and what's going to happen on the day.\"\n\nScott added that despite being a long-established radio presenter, he's nervous about his speech - which he's yet to write. \"What I haven't written yet, which I think I should tackle quite soon and I'll probably do it the week after Eurovision, is my speech,\" he added.\n\n\"I think especially in my job, there will be high expectations of 'Oh his speech is going to be good.' Well, I haven't written it yet and also I'm not that good at public speaking despite being on the radio every day. So I think I'm feeling the pressure about my speech, because I've got to nail that, haven't I?\"\n\nAs for whether guests can expect a Eurovision theme for his big day, Scott admitted that there will be \"nods\" to the iconic singing contest.\n\n\"I'm actually taking my fianc\u00e9 to Eurovision this year. When we met, he kind of knew what I did but he didn't know that I worked on Eurovision and he was like, 'No, I don't like Eurovision, it's not really for me, I don't get it.'\n\n\"That was fine. Then I said to him one year - the first year that me and Rylan started working together - I said, 'Just come for two days and see if you like it.' He came for two days, absolutely loved it and has been there ever since for the whole week!\n\n\"He's gone from disliking Eurovision to loving it so much that there are not one but two nods to Eurovision at our wedding.\"\n\nWhile Scott is keeping tight-lipped about the Eurovision cameos, he hinted: \"One of them is a surprise. One of them is when people enter the room, one of the songs as the guests sit down is a Eurovision winning song.\n\n\"It's not that hard to work out. When I told the people who are going to be performing it, I thought they'd be like, 'What's that?' They were like 'Oh, everyone knows that song, of course we'll do it' So they're going to do a slow, acoustic version of this winning song.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 begins with the semi-finals on Tuesday 7th May and Thursday 9th May at 8pm on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.

The group, adorned in sequins and sparkles inspired by the competition, arrived at Copenhagen airport before making their way to the venue in Malmo ahead of the semi-final.\n\nThe enthusiastic fans boarded an easyJet flight, the official airline of the contest, from London Gatwick at the break of dawn, which quickly turned into a singalong to kickstart the festivities. The flight featured a themed baggage drop, fancy dress, and a talent show at 40,000 feet, hosted by Drag Race star Tia Kofi.\n\nOne of the Eurovision enthusiasts who made the journey said: \"The flight laid on for us today was the ultimate treat for any Eurovision fan who loves to celebrate the glitz, glamour, and unity of Eurovision. I can't believe what an amazing experience it's been so far, and we haven't even left the airport yet.\"\n\nThis comes after a survey revealed that six and a half million Brits will be attending a Eurovision party this year. More than a third (35 per cent) of the 2,000 adults surveyed will be tuning into the singing contest this year, with 36 per cent of those either hosting their own festivities or celebrating at someone else's home.\n\nAnd one in five will be dressed in iconic Eurovision looks - with D'Nash, the 2007 Spanish entrant, Brotherhood of Man, the UK winners of 1976, and Ireland's 2021 entrant, Jedward, being the most popular.\n\nBelarus' 3 + 2, iconic Swedish band ABBA and Celine Dion's 1974 entry for France are among the outfits that closely follow in popularity. In addition to dressing up, 38 per cent of fans will serve food inspired by the competing countries, such as Italy, Spain, and Greece.\n\nMichael Brown, director of cabin services at easyJet, expressed his pride in being part of the Eurovision phenomenon, stating: \"We are proud to be part of the Eurovision phenomenon, providing a glittering platform for fans to start their Eurovision journey. Our Super Fan Flight to Copenhagen promises to be a memorable adventure - a high-flying act of its own.\"\n\n\"The flight laid on for us today was the ultimate treat for any Eurovision fan who loves to celebrate the glitz, glamour, and unity of Eurovision. Our mission is to connect people and cultures together, and we're proud to be the Official Airline of the Eurovision Song Contest who share this passion.\"\n\nThe research also revealed that 39 per cent of respondents love the Eurovision song contest, with 23 per cent becoming bigger fans after it was hosted in Liverpool last year.\n\nThe songs (31 per cent), commentary (24 per cent) and the outfits (21 per cent) were cited as the top reasons for their love of the event. Furthermore, 27 per cent have been inspired to visit new countries because of Eurovision, with Italy, Greece and Spain topping the list.\n\nIt also emerged that 42 per cent would enjoy being in the live audience due to the sense of unity between nations (21 per cent), celebrating diversity (19 per cent) and being around like-minded people (12 per cent).\n\nWhen asked about the UK's entry this year, 64 per cent don't think we are likely to win, with 43 per cent attributing this to our bad track record. However, 33 per cent of the respondents believe that 'Dizzy' by Olly Alexander is the best song we've released in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "hulldailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hull Daily Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "esti_pujana@hulldailymail.co.uk", "name": "Esti Pujana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tia_Kofi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tia Kofi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatwick_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gatwick Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Man", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedward", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jedward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brit Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celine Dion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i2-prod.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article9268611.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_easyJet_Eurovision_007JPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Back then I didn't know that it would one day be called a 'political symbol'.\n\n\"It's like calling 'Dalah\u00e4sten' [a traditional Swedish horse statue] a political symbol. In my eyes it's only racism.\"\n\n\"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that felt real to me - but the EBU seem to think that my ethnicity is controversial. It says nothing about me, but everything about them. I say like this year's ESC-slogan: United by music.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to his performance, Eric branded the EBU's \"handling\" of this year's Eurovision \"disgraceful\", and wrote the slogan United By Music is \"a joke\".\n\nHe also claimed organisers \"do not permit any Palestinian symbols inside the arena\" while \"symbols representing any other ethnicity in the world are welcomed\".\n\n\"Therefore, it is more crucial than ever for me to be present on THAT STAGE,\" he added. \"You may take our symbols, but you cannot take away my presence.\"\n\nReports have claimed that since 2023, only flags of the competing countries, the European Union flag and the Pride flag are permitted inside a Eurovision venue.\n\nHuffPost UK has contacted the EBU for clarification on this.\n\nThis year's Eurovision Song Contest is taking place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, and has faced a backlash from some regular fans due to Israel's continued involvement, despite the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.\n\nAfter facing calls to withdraw from the competition in solidarity with Palestine, a number of acts - including the UK's own Olly Alexander - released a joint statement which read: \"In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent.\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages. We stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"\n\nAfter the first semi-final on Tuesday, Irish act Bambie Thug claimed they'd also been made by the EBU to remove messages of solidarity with Palestine from their stage costume.\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Eurovision organisers had taken issue with Israel's submitted song due to its supposedly \"political\" lyrics, with the country's national broadcaster Kan saying they would rather withdraw from the competition than change the song.\n\nHowever, the Israeli delegation later appeared to have had a change of heart, after it was confirmed that Eden Golan would be representing Israel at the competition, with a rewritten version of her original song, now titled Hurricane, after being changed from October Rain.", "source": {"uri": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You can see all 37 of the official entries (and the associated music videos) for Eurovision 2024 here.\n\nIn the first semi-final, Cyprus has been selected to go first, while Serbia is second, in a so-called \"death slot\", along with Lithuania (third).\n\nEurovision has been around for long enough to generate its fair share of superstition. According to Reddit, most people consider the second and third performance slots in the semis to be the \"slots of death\" - positions in the running order that it is very difficult to qualify from.\n\nUkraine will be the fifth country to perform in the first semi-final, after Ireland.\n\nThe second semi final will see Malta go first, with Albania and Greece taking the so-called \"death slots\".\n\nAs ever, the \"Big Five\" countries France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) will not compete in the semis, and neither will Sweden as reigning champions, which is why they are not numbered above. But the draw did decide which of the two events each would be able to vote in.\n\nHosted in the Swedish capital by television presenters Farah Abadi and Pernilla M\u00e5nsson Colt, the draw was overseen by the contest's executive supervisor, Martin \u00d6sterdahl. The results were announced live on the official Eurovision YouTube channel, as well as on BBC Two and iPlayer.\n\n\"We're thrilled to kick off another exciting year for the Eurovision Song Contest here in Malm\u00f6,\" \u00d6sterdahl said.\n\n\"Liverpool set the standard in 2023 when it comes to hosting and embracing this event and we're looking forward to Malm\u00f6 building on that incredible work when we welcome 37 delegations and hundreds of thousands of fans in May.\"\n\nHere are the confirmed Eurovision 2024 semi-final line-ups and, where they've already been announced, the songs and artists.\n\nEurovision's semi-final one airs at 8pm BST on Tuesday 7 May at 8pm on BBC One in the UK.\n\nThe 'Big 5' countries that will vote in semi-final one are Germany, Sweden and the

"Eurovision facing controversy over contestants and political statements - as protests around event expected", "body": "Security is being tightened in Malmo, Sweden, with demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war planned around Eurovision's second semi-final on Thursday and the main event on Saturday.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is already facing controversy over performers making political statements ahead of the big event in Sweden at the weekend.\n\nBambie Thug, who will represent Ireland, has criticised organisers for asking the performer to alter a pro-Palestinian message before their performance in the first semi-final last night.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has put out a statement expressing \"regret\" that former Swedish contestant Eric Saade, who is reportedly of Palestinian origin, was wearing a keffiyeh - a traditional scarf that has become a symbol of support - tied around his wrist as he sang.\n\nHe is not competing this year, but opened the first Eurovision semi-final show in his home country ahead of the finalists being chosen.\n\nEurovision bills itself as a non-political event and organisers have resisted calls to boycott Israel, sparking protests.\n\nIsrael's Eden Golan will perform her song Hurricane in the second semi-final on Thursday, with bookmakers placing her among the top 10 most likely to win the competition.\n\nSecurity is being ramped up in the Swedish host city of Malmo, which expects to welcome some 100,000 Eurovision fans - along with thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters, with demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war planned on Thursday and Saturday.\n\nAfter making it through to the final with their song Doomsday Blue, Ireland's Bambie Thug told reporters at a news conference that they had been forced to change writing painted on their body ahead of the semi-final performance.\n\nThe 31-year-old singer said the painted script in Ogham - an early Medieval alphabet - had translated to 'ceasefire and freedom'.\n\n\"It was very important for me because I'm pro justice and pro peace,\" they said. \"Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'crown the witch' only (which was an) order from the EBU.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the EBU said: \"The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n\"After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.\"\n\nIn a separate statement about Saade's opening performance, an EBU spokesperson said the organisation \"regrets\" that he chose to wear the keffiyeh pattern material and \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nElsewhere, UK entrant Olly Alexander also performed at the event to showcase his song, Dizzy, although he is already through to the final as the UK is one of the \"big five\" Eurovision donors.\n\nThe Years & Years singer has found himself facing criticism from some who called for him to withdraw over Israel's inclusion amid the ongoing war.\n\nHe addressed the controversy in a documentary following him as he prepares for the show, describing some comments he and other contestants have received as \"very extreme\".\n\nIn April, Eurovision organisers condemned the abuse and harassment of contestants over Israel's inclusion in the competition as \"unacceptable and totally unfair\".\n\nRead more on Eurovision:\n\nWho will win and the acts to look out for\n\nEverything you need to know about this year's show\n\nSpeaking on Sky's Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, EBU deputy director general Jean Philip De Tender defended Israel's inclusion.\n\n\"We do understand the concerns and deeply held views around the war in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\n\"The song contest is a music event organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"Our governing bodies reviewed the participation of Kan [Israel's public broadcasting corporation] and found that they met all of the competing rules.\"", "source": {"uri":

The Israeli National Security Agency saying it has made plans to raise the threat level from two to three amid heightened tensions over the war in Gaza. Widespread protests are expected to cast a shadow over the event.\n\nIt comes after the Eurovision organisers said they reserve the right to remove any Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols at the show in Sweden. The announcement came amid heightened tensions surrounding Israel's participation in the annual music competition over its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, now in its seventh month.\n\nUK Eurovision entry Olly Alexander admits struggles amid Israel controversy\n\nPro-Palestinian groups are expected to stage large protests in Malmo to raise awareness of their cause. Activists who want Israel - a former winner - out of the Eurovision Song Contest have announced large rallies in central Malmo, several miles from the Malmo Arena contest venue.\n\nOlly admits he's feeling a bit \"overwhelmed\" at competing and talking to The Times about the controversy, the talented Years & Years frontman said: \"Obviously there are a lot of things I wish were different. And this is so much bigger than me and Eurovision, it really is. Obviously, I wish there wasn't a war or this insane humanitarian crisis.\"\n\nEstimates suggest that around 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza, around 70 per of those said to be women and children. The star went on: \"I wish for peace and I have found this experience, at times, extremely... I've just felt really sad and distressed. But I still believe it's a good thing when people come together for entertainment. That's why I wanted to do Eurovision.\"\n\nThe singer told the Mirror he is unable to think about anything other than the competition on Saturday. He said: \"I go to bed thinking of Eurovision, I dream about Eurovision, I wake up thinking about Eurovision. It's just constantly, constantly in my head. I feel like I've gone through everything that could possibly go wrong, every eventual possibility, it's happened in my head already in one way or another. So I don't know any more. I'm just overwhelmed.\"\n\nBBC host Graham Norton reckons Olly could excel in Sweden this weekend. \"Having a bona fide pop star representing the UK this year is a great start,\" he says. \"Olly has already done all the things that it's impossible to prepare someone for. He has played to huge crowds, he can relate to the cameras, and he is used to high pressure situations. Add to that, the fact that the song is a massive bop and I think we could do really well this year.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_elliott_gibbs@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Sam Elliott-Gibbs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_&_Years", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Years & Years"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graham Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32757817.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UK-Eurovision-entry-Olly-Alexander-admits-struggles-amid-Israel-controversy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nHe also noted the EBU, an apolitical member organisation, is \"in line\" with other international federations including sports bodies who are allowing Israel to participate in events.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nIn March, Alexander along with Irish hopeful Bambie Thug and other Eurovision artists released a joint statement, backing \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire\" but refusing to boycott the event.\n\nThat same month, Israel unveiled its new entry song as Hurricane, performed by singer Eden Golan.\n\nHer original track, October Rain, had caused controversy as the lyrics were thought to reference the Hamas attacks of October 7 before being changed following the backlash.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan, which is the Israeli public broadcaster, met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\nIn 2022, EBU announced that Russia would no longer be participating in Eurovision following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA statement at the time said the EBU's executive board had made the decision following a recommendation by the Eurovision governing body, known as the reference group, based on \"the rules of the event and the values of the EBU\".\n\nOn Sunday, De Tender said the situation between Russia and Israel was \"different\" as in Russia's case there was a \"broad consensus within the membership of the EBU that they could not participate\".\n\nHe added that the three Russian members of the EBU had already been \"excluded\" from the EBU membership in the weeks after the war broke out due to breaching \"member obligations\".\n\nThe 37 Eurovision entries are set to perform across two semi-finals next week on Tuesday and Thursday in a bid to compete for a place in the grand final on Saturday.\n\nAlexander is set to perform his dance-infused track Dizzy on behalf of the UK during the Tuesday semi-final, but he is already through to the final along with the other members of the \"big five\" - France, Germany, Italy and Spain - as well as last year's winner Sweden, who get to go through automatically.\n\nDe Tender said the preparations are going \"very well\" as they have been planning the music spectacle in Sweden for the past year after Loreen won the competition with her hit song Tattoo.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com",

It's going to be an unmissable few nights: full of eye-popping outfits, soaring vocals, and wildly outrageous performances.\n\nYou can watch \"Eurovision 2024\" online from anywhere with a VPN - and potentially for FREE!\n\nSweden is hosting for the seventh time after singer Loreen took the trophy home for her song \"Tattoo\" last year, while Swedish comedian and 2016 presenter Petra Mede also returns, alongside Hollywood actress Malin \u00c5kerman.\n\nWith the 37 acts representing countries around the world, and an estimated global TV audience of 160 million watching, the pressure is on to deliver a barnstorming show.\n\nThe likes of Croatia, Azerbaijan, Israel and Italy will go head-to-head in the two semi-finals starting Tuesday, May 7. The 10 countries granted the most votes in each round will proceed to the May 11 finale, alongside the automatically qualifying \"Big Five\" - France, the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain - and host country Sweden.\n\nAmong those looking to leave an indelible impression on \"Eurovision\" are Windows95man, representing Finland with the gleefully silly song, \"No Rules!\" Then there's Olly Alexander's vertiginous U.K. entry, \"Dizzy,\" Australia's catchy and moving \"One Mikali (One Blood)\" from Electric Fields.\n\nOur guide below, which explains how to watch \"Eurovision 2024\" online and FREE from anywhere with a VPN.\n\nAway from home at the moment and blocked from watching the \"Eurovision 2024\" semi-finals and grand finale on BBC iPlayer?\n\nYou can still watch \"Eurovision 2024\" online thanks to the wonders of a VPN (Virtual Private Network). The software allows your devices to appear to be back in your home country regardless of where you are in the world. So it's ideal for viewers out of the country looking to join in the fun. Our favourite is NordVPN. It's the best on the market:\n\nU.S. followers of the international singing competition can watch \"Eurovision 2024\" online exclusively on Peacock.\n\nAll three broadcasts will be live, beginning on Tuesday, May 7 with the first semi-final, the second on Thursday, May 9, and the showstopping final event on Saturday, May 11. Stateside, each episode is available to stream from 3 p.m. ET / 12 p.m. PT. NB: Peacock doesn't provide any local \"Eurovision\" commentary.\n\nPeacock TV costs from $5.99 a month for a Peacock Premium membership. But if you want the ad-free experience, you'll want to try Peacock Premium Plus at $11.99 a month.\n\nAnd not only is Peacock one of the best streaming services, but it is available on most of the best streaming devices.\n\nCurrently away from home? Download a VPN and connect to the services you enjoy free-of-charge back home, without having to register for any additional subscriptions.\n\nWhile there's no official broadcaster in Canada, fans in the Great White North can watch every semi-final and the grand finale live from Tuesday, May 7 through the Eurovision Song Contest YouTube channel.\n\nThe European broadcast is 9 p.m. CEST, which means the two semi-finals and the barnstorming concluding show will air at 3 p.m. ET / 12 p.m. PT in Canada. As with Peacock, this live feed doesn't have a local presenter - so, if you're a Brit abroad and don't have a VPN, you won't get the snarky banter of BBC presenters like Graham Norton.\n\nViewers Down Under can watch \"Eurovision 2024\" online and catch all the spectacle of Eurovision on streaming service SBS On Demand. It's completely free to use and takes just a few seconds to create an account.\n\nAdjusting for time zones, Aussies will be able to watch \"Eurovision\" from Wednesday, May 8 at the rather early time of 5 a.m. AEST. That semi-final is followed by another on Friday, May 10, before the big finale at Malm\u00f6 Arena on Saturday, May 12.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's

(Getty)\n\nUpdated betting odds ahead of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 suggest that the legendary singing competition could be won by an LGBTQ+ artist this year.\n\nWe're now just weeks away from the return of Eurovision, this time in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, following on from the historic victory from bisexual pop icon Loreen last year.\n\nAs ever, this year's line-up includes a number of incredible LGBTQ+ performers representing their countries on the world's biggest music stage, including Ireland's Bambie Thug and Lithuania's Silvester Belt.\n\nAnd now, according to the betting public, an LGBTQ+ artist looks likely to win the contest this year - but sadly, it's not the UK's Eurovision act and Years & Years star, Olly Alexander.\n\nHere are the top five entrants most likely to win Eurovision 2024.\n\nThe fifth most likely entrant to win Eurovision 2024 right now is Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil for 2022's winning country, Ukraine. Their thumping, broody track \"Teresa & Marie\" currently has a six per cent chance of winning, and while it's a strong favourite among Eurovision fans, that favour appears to be lessening - this is the lowest the song has been in terms of betting odds so far.\n\nFiery earworm \"La Noia\" by Angelina Mango, Italy's entrant, looks set to be a huge hit with the Eurovision gays regardless of whether it takes the win or not. The song is currently fourth most likely to do so, but its odds have fallen in recent weeks, so let's not get our hopes up.\n\n\"Europapa\" by award-winning Dutch artist Joost Klein could very well be the \"Cha Cha Cha\" of 2024 - it's just as wild, wacky and well-suited to a rave as the K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4 track, and it's also set for a top three finish. Joost Klein's odds are continuing to climb, and if he does take the win, it will be the second time in five years that the Netherlands have done so.\n\nWith an artist name and track title like that, of course Croatia are potentially in line for the win. According to the betting odds, they've got a very strong shot at doing so too, with about a fifth of the public thinking they're going to - and the odds are increasing.\n\n\"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" is a funny, silly rock-meets-rap-meets-rave song, so it's destined to be a hit during the semi-finals and finals, too. Plus, if Baby Lasagna does win, it will be pretty historic: Croatia has never won the Eurovision Song Contest before.\n\nIf the betting public are right, Switzerland's non-binary singer and rapper Nemo is looking likely to take the Eurovision title this year, with approximately a quarter of betters believing they will do.\n\nThe musician's entry, \"The Code\", is an electric and pulsating track combining Nemo's soaring vocals and impressive rap ability. It's got star-power stamped all over it, much like Loreen's \"Tattoo\" did last year, and from the song alone we can tell the live performance at the grand finale will raise the roof off of Malm\u00f6 Arena. Fingers crossed.\n\nSadly, things aren't looking too great for UK entrant Olly Alexander and his song \"Dizzy\", nor for other LGBTQ+ contestants this year. Currently, Olly is the 12th favourite to win, while non-binary \"ouija pop\" star Bambi Thug is in 10th place.\n\nSilvester Belt, Lithuania's first LGBTQ+ artist to enter Eurovision, is sitting in 14th place, while Denmark's Saba is 25th most likely to win.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest semi-finals take place on 7 and 9 May, and the grand final will air on Saturday 11 May.", "source": {"uri":

The city also hosted Eurovision in 1992 and in 2013.\n\nSweden has hosted Eurovision seven times in total, counting in 2024. Stockholm, the capital, hosted the competition in 1975, 2000, and 2016 and Gothenburg in 1985.\n\nThe concert venue is Malm\u00f6 Arena with a capacity of up to 15,500.\n\nViewers decide the results of the two semi-finals and can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or via a Eurovision app.\n\nViewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 are eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nViewers in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 are eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain.\n\nIn the final, audience votes will make up half of the result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country will make up the other half.\n\nThe juries will rank the songs based on composition and originality of the song, quality of the stage performance, the artists' vocal capacity, and their overall impression of the act.\n\nNon-participating countries around the world will also be able to vote, and will collectively have the weight of one additional voting country.\n\nNew to this year's Eurovision, viewers outside the participating countries can vote 24 hours prior each semi-final and the Grand final.\n\nCyprus, Serbia, Lithuania, Ireland, Ukraine, Poland, Croatia, Iceland, Slovenia, Finland, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Australia, Portugal, and Luxembourg.\n\nMalta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe top 10 from each semi-final will participate in the final.\n\nThe previous year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe \"Big Five\" countries are France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which bring the biggest financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\nSince 2000, these countries have secured themselves an automatic spot in the Grand Final.\n\nThe song contest will be broadcast by all 37 participating countries. It will also be streamed on YouTube.\n\nBookmakers have Croatia, Switzerland and Ukraine as the top three favourites to win, while streaming data from Spotify suggests a strong chance for the Netherlands, Italy or host nation Sweden.\n\nThe song contest will be presented by Swedish comedian and actress Petra Mede and Swedish-American actress Malin \u00c5kerman.\n\nThe Eurovision song contest is one of the world's largest television events, and has been held annually since 1956.\n\nEurovision features live music performances from most European countries and beyond, including Israel and Australia.\n\nOriginally it started as a technical experiment for transnational broadcast television with only seven countries competing: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy.\n\nThe show reached 162 million people in 2023 through public service markets.\n\nSweden and Ireland are leading with seven wins each. France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have each won five times, with the Netherlands as the most recent of the four countries to win in 2019.\n\nSwedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool for the second time with her song \"Tattoo\". She is the only person after Ireland's Johnny Logan to win the contest twice.\n\n(Reporting by Isabelle Yr Carlsson and Louise Breusch Rasmussen; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen, Sharon Singleton

The brothers reached No. 5 the following year with their second Eurovision entry \"Waterline\", but since then no Irish Eurovision song has even made the top ten.\n\nFive of Ireland's seven Eurovison winners reached number one in their home country. Among the two that didn't was Charlie McGettigan and Paul Harrington's \"Rock 'n' Roll Kids\", despite the song's huge popularity and its record total of 226 points in the Eurovision final. But the omission from our fifteen is easy to explain: Charlie and Paul had to compete with \"Riverdance\", the most successful Eurovision interval act of all time.\n\n\"Riverdance\" spent a record 18 weeks lodged at number one; \"Rock 'n' Roll Kids\" had to settle for seven weeks in the top ten, without ever securing the coveted top spot.\n\nEimear Quinn's \"The Voice\", Ireland's Eurovision winner in 1996, also failed to top the charts, peaking at number three. It was a sign of the turning tide in Irish Eurovision fortunes. A year after Quinn scored Ireland's seventh win in the competition, Marc Roberts came close, finishing runner-up with \"Mysterious Woman\". Since then it's been a downward curve, with Ireland failing to even compete in the final on eleven occasions.\n\nOne thing our list of 15 chart-toppers reveals is that Eurovision voters and the Irish public don't always see eye to eye.\n\nChris Doran's \"If My World Stopped Turning\" finished second last in the 2004 final with just 7 points (the winner had 280), but the song was a No. 1 hit in Ireland.\n\nSandie Jones' \"Ceol an Ghr\u00e1\", the only song as Gaeilge to represent Ireland in the history of the Eurovision, was number one in 1972 but finished 15th out of 18 songs in the contest final.\n\nUp to 1998 every single Irish Eurovision entry made the charts, with just four falling outside the top ten. Since 1999, six songs have failed to chart at all: The Mullans' \"When You Need Love\", Eamonn Toal's \"Millennium of Love\", Gary O'Shaughnessy's \"Without Your Love\", Dervish's \"They Can't Stop The Spring\", Brendan Murray's \"Dying To Try\" and Sarah McTernan's 2019 entry \"22\".

It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nHe also noted the EBU, an apolitical member organisation, is \"in line\" with other international federations including sports bodies who are allowing Israel to participate in events.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nIn March, Alexander along with Irish hopeful Bambie Thug and other Eurovision artists released a joint statement, backing \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire\" but refusing to boycott the event.\n\nThat same month, Israel unveiled its new entry song as Hurricane, performed by singer Eden Golan.\n\nHer original track, October Rain, had caused controversy as the lyrics were thought to reference the Hamas attacks of October 7 before being changed following the backlash.\n\nDiscussing the backlash, De Tender said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan, which is the Israeli public broadcaster, met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\nIn 2022, EBU announced that Russia would no longer be participating in Eurovision following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA statement at the time said the EBU's executive board had made the decision following a recommendation by the Eurovision governing body, known as the reference group, based on \"the rules of the event and the values of the EBU\".\n\nOn Sunday, De Tender said the situation between Russia and Israel was \"different\" as in Russia's case there was a \"broad consensus within the membership of the EBU that they could not participate\".\n\nHe added that the three Russian members of the EBU had already been \"excluded\" from the EBU membership in the weeks after the war broke out due to breaching \"member obligations\".\n\nThe 37 Eurovision entries are set to perform across two semi-finals next week on Tuesday and Thursday in a bid to compete for a place in the grand final on Saturday.\n\nAlexander is set to perform his dance-infused track Dizzy on behalf of the UK during the Tuesday semi-final, but he is already through to the final along with the other members of the \"big five\" - France, Germany, Italy and Spain - as well as last year's winner Sweden, who get to go through automatically.\n\nDe Tender said the preparations are going \"very well\" as they have been planning the music spectacle in Sweden for the past year after Loreen won the competition with her hit song Tattoo.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Sun 5 May 2024, 2:36 PM Last updated: Sun 5 May 2024, 2:53 PM", "source": {"uri": "meathchronicle.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Meath Chronicle"},

The brothers reached No. 5 the following year with their second Eurovision entry \"Waterline\", but since then no Irish Eurovision song has even made the top ten.\n\nFive of Ireland's seven Eurovison winners reached number one in their home country. Among the two that didn't was Charlie McGettigan and Paul Harrington's \"Rock 'n' Roll Kids\", despite the song's huge popularity and its record total of 226 points in the Eurovision final. But the omission from our fifteen is easy to explain: Charlie and Paul had to compete with \"Riverdance\", the most successful Eurovision interval act of all time.\n\n\"Riverdance\" spent a record 18 weeks lodged at number one; \"Rock 'n' Roll Kids\" had to settle for seven weeks in the top ten.\n\nEimear Quinn's \"The Voice\", Ireland's Eurovision winner in 1996, also failed to land the Irish charts top spot, peaking at number three. It was a sign of the turning tide in Irish Eurovision fortunes. A year after Quinn scored Ireland's seventh win in the competition, Marc Roberts came close, finishing runner-up with \"Mysterious Woman\". Since then it's been a downward curve, with Ireland failing to even reach the final on eleven occasions.\n\nOne thing our list of 15 chart-toppers reveals is that Eurovision voters and the Irish public don't always see eye to eye.\n\nChris Doran's \"If My World Stopped Turning\" finished second last in the final with just 7 points (the winner had 280), but the song was a No. 1 hit in Ireland.\n\nSandie Jones' \"Ceol an Ghr\u00e1\", the only song as Gaeilge to represent Ireland in the history of the Eurovision, was number one in 1972 but finished 15th out of 18 songs in the contest final.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_'n'_Roll_Kids", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock 'n' Roll Kids"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Harrington_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Harrington (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Singles_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish Singles Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Kinds_of_Everything", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All Kinds of Everything"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McGettigan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McGettigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedward", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jedward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverdance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverdance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_(Jedward_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lipstick (Jedward song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterline_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waterline (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Roberts_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Roberts (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandie_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sandie Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Doran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Doran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_(Eimear_Quinn_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Voice (Eimear Quinn song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Grip", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Grip", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The three live shows are expected to attract 162 million viewers.\n\nSVT is working in partnership with facilities provider NEP and with Eurovision Services, the one-time broadcasting arm of the EBU but that has been owned by Munich-based venture capital firm Dubag Group since February 2023. The EBU remains Eurovision's main customer and the Song Contest the largest event it works on.\n\n\"I've loved Eurovision since I was a little boy and I still have to pinch myself that I get to help produce Eurovision as a job,\" says Lennard Bartlett, project leader at Eurovision Services. \"It's a great privilege and I'm very proud of my Eurovision Services team and EBU and BBC colleagues for what we achieved together last year. Over to you SVT - bring it on.\"\n\nEurovision Services provides distribution of the produced world feed and is producer of the live voting element of the final in which 37 live feeds from participating members need intricate coordination with belt and braces backup.\n\nSpeaking from the Eurovision Services truck located in the OB compound 20m outside of the Malm\u00f6 Arena, Bartlett says: \"It is the biggest live music event in the world by audience and no other show attempts live voting on this scale.\"\n\nThe world feed itself remains in 1080i 50 SDR after an assessment by the EBU after the 2023 event in Liverpool found there was not sufficient demand for a 4K UHD HDR (or even a HD HDR) production among its public service broadcaster community.\n\nThat said, production values are being upgraded with capture for the first time in Progressive Segmented Frame (PsF), a means of acquiring, producing and distributing a progressive scan from interlace equipment.\n\n\"The intent is to add a more filmic look to performances,\" says Bartlett. \"Inside the arena you can really tell that the standards of lighting, staging and sound quality will be top notch in terms of production standards. You can see that too in monitors from the OB compound during rehearsals that this is going to be a very high-quality show.\"\n\nRoe Visual is the official supplier of all LED kit for the song contest; Creative Technology Sweden is responsible for the installation.\n\nThis comprises around 1,000sqm of LED screen, including a stage floor LED of 186sqm and a backdrop LED screen of 340sqm. Hanging from the ceiling of the arena are five LED cubes totalling 460sqm.\n\nA 6-person stage management team leads the three live shows and manage a further 36 crew who have just 55 seconds to reset the stage between each of the 37 songs. These movements have been carefully choreographed and rehearsed, just like everything else in the live shows.\n\nEurovision Services' facility is connected to NEP's OB truck via a Technical Operations Centre (TOC) and manages onward distribution over fibre and/or via satellite to all EBU members. Signal redundancy is provided from two teleports including one in Geneva.\n\nSignals for the live voting components are contributed via satellite or direct fibre connection or video over IP.\n\n\"We require each of the 37 participating members to provide us with a main feed and a back-up link,\" he adds.\n\n\"It is the biggest live music event in the world by audience and no other show attempts live voting on this scale\"\n\nSecurity is another crucial part of the Eurovision Services operation and it is the piece of the puzzle that shifts most year on year.\n\nBartlett explains: \"We can't go into detail on the mechanisms we have in force for obvious reasons, but it is an area we reassess regularly to make sure we have the latest encryption methods and that our kit is patched with the latest updates to the highest specification basically to ensure we are protected. We've taken aboard information provided by SVT, EBU and other security agencies to ensure we're operating within the evolving cybersecurity picture.\"\n\nThis is Bartlett's second Song Contest as project lead but the 12th for lead engineer Felix Berndt. Many of the team producing in Malm\u00f6 are veterans of the 2013 show also hosted in Malm\u00f6 and of the 2016 event in Stockholm.\n\n\"We've a very experienced team and it all has a very family feel,\" he says. \"The vibe is definitely building. The city is getting prepared and hardcore fans are arriving. The Eurovision Village and Eurovision Street and other dedicated areas are buzzing. It promises to be a huge production.\"\n\nIn one change to the format, artists from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, plus Sweden, will each perform their entries live during the semi-finals.

To keep you up to date on everything going on in Malm\u00f6, we're hosting a party for everybody (well, maybe just Eurovision fans) over on WhatsApp.\n\nWe'll send you all the drama, memes and iconic moments from the live shows, plus any gossip from behind the scenes\n\nYou can also get involved by sending us your reactions to your favourite acts and voting in our polls, as we get closer to finding out who will be the winner of Eurovision 2024.\n\nJust click the link here, select 'Join Chat' and you're in!\n\nBambie has now spoken about the immense criticism they've been receiving, telling Metro.co.uk: 'We couldn't stay silent on the matter. I basically said what I wanted to say in my statement, but it is down to the EBU and it is down to even my broadcaster.\n\n'I'm getting a lot of targeted abuse that I don't think it's entirely fair, actually, when I'm not the one that's making the decisions, but I am extremely pro Palestine and it is disappointing that the EBU has made this this decision because I don't think it's correct.'\n\nFollowing backlash, and horrific transphobic hate, non-binary artist Bambie has taken a break from social media, and is trying to heal while going to therapy.\n\nThey went on: 'It's a lot to take, from the transphobic abuse online and also just coming for my character in terms of this boycott thing.\n\n'My sister would often call me up and say one of the comments in like a silly voice to try and make me not feel it as much but I've had to stop looking at them because even subconsciously, if you're seeing that all the time, it's not doing you any good, certainly not doing me good for my mental health.'\n\nThe Tsunami singer went on: 'I'm in therapy at the moment for a lot of trauma, so I just need to really bubble myself, because otherwise I wouldn't get through this period.\n\n'I really need to prioritise the fact that I am healing and also the fact that I just don't need to see all that abuse because I know who I am. I know where I stand.\n\n'People online can be really, really, really nasty, and I think they forget that there's a person behind the screen, especially when you become in the public eye.\n\n'So I'm okay, I'm prioritising my healing. It is difficult but I'm here for progression of myself and healing of myself and that's all I can really do, work on me.'\n\nEurovision has sparked immense backlash in recent months over including Israel in the Song Contest, with more than 2,000 artists from Iceland, Finland, and the host country Sweden signing open letters asking for Israel to be banned.\n\nProtests in some of those countries have called for Israel to be suspended from the Song Contest following Israel's retaliation in Gaza after the Israel-Hamas conflict began on October 7.\n\nStars including Dame Helen Mirren, Boy George and Sharon Osbourne are amongst those who have signed an open letter supporting the country's inclusion, after it was shared on non-profit body Creative Community For Peace, who campaign against cultural boycotts of Israel.\n\nThere was further controversy over Israel's entry Eden Golan singing October Rain, which contained lyrics that described the situation around the Hamas attack that killed around 1,200 people and took hundreds hostage.\n\nIsrael's public broadcaster Kan later agreed to change the lyrics to the song, and said they had reached out to the songwriters to 'readjust the texts, with full artistic freedom' before being sent to the EBU for approval.\n\nThe earlier statement shared by Eurovision entrants including Olly and Bambie read: 'We want to begin by acknowledging the privilege of taking part in Eurovision.\n\n'In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent. It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages.\n\n'We stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.'\n\nIt continued: 'We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.\n\n'We feel it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.'\n\nTheir statement came as Jean Philip De Tender, Deputy Director General of the EBU, said: 'The European Broadcasting Union acknowledges the depth of feeling and the strong opinions that this year's Eurovision Song Contest - set against the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East - has provoked.\n\n'We understand that people will want to engage in debate and express their deeply held views on this matter. We have all been affected by the images, stories and the unquestionable pain suffered by those in Israel and in Gaza.\n\n'However, we wish to address the concerns and discussions surrounding this situation, especially the targeted social media campaigns against some of our participating artists.\n\n'The decision to include any broadcaster, including the Israeli broadcaster Kan, in the Eurovision Song Contest is the sole responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies and not that of the individual artists. These artists come to Eurovision to share their music, culture, and the universal message of unity through the language of music.'\n\nThe statement stressed the EBU's previous explanations for the inclusion of Israeli broadcaster Kan, saying: 'Constructive debate is a positive consequence of such decisions.\n\n'However, while we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest. This is unacceptable and totally unfair, given the artists have no role in this decision.'\n\nThe statement ended: 'The EBU is dedicated to providing a safe and supportive environment for all participants, staff, and fans of the Eurovision Song Contest. We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to promote the values of respect, inclusivity, and understanding, both online and offline.\n\n'We urge everyone to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue and support the artists who are working tirelessly - on what is a music and entertainment show - to share their music with the world.'\n\nBambie earlier told Late Late host Patrick Kielty: 'I stand with anyone doing the boycott. I think if I wasn't in the competition, I would also be boycotting. There are a lot of moving parts.\n\n'At the end of the day, without the group of us who is pro-Palestine, it is less competition for the other side to win and it's less of solidarity there. Obviously it's incredibly heavy and I am extremely behind everybody.'\n\nThey went on to echo the sentiment that they don't believe the EBU are 'making the right decision'.\n\nElsewhere in the interview with Metro.co.uk, Bambie spoke about feeling confident in their performance and proud of their feat in getting to Eurovision.\n\nThey said: 'I'm an independent artist and other than this I would have never been put in front of so many people, so soon, unsigned or anything, so that's incredible.\n\n'I think it's a feat in itself to get there, and for us to be in the top 10 after my country not being in the top 10 or in the final for 10 years, and even just for the alt scene, and the queer scene and goths, it's great that we're there.\n\n'Seeing that the doors are opening for more not-so-Normcore music is really encouraging, and I've gotten a lot of love since being involved and people finding my art, finding my old songs and it's been a good boost because it is hard grinding this plane independently so I'm proud of myself regardless.'\n\nAfter seeing idols Conchita Wurst and Celine Dion take to the Eurovision stage, Bambie is now bringing in their own genre - Ouija Pop.\n\n'Ouija Pop is any music that I touch,' they laughed. 'It's no constraints, no rules, genre blending and tinged with a cult language because even if I'm writing a pop song, there's a cult language in there, I just can't get away from it, I don't want to.'\n\nDespite smashing barriers and gender norms, Bambie has somehow been on the end of shocking abuse from a priest earlier this year, who said Ireland is 'finished as a country'.\n\nHe hit out at Bambie, saying, according to The Mirror: 'The poor devil can neither sing nor dance,' going on: 'I don't care what [they] dressed like, but on [their] back... there was a slogan and I said to myself, \"Is this what we need now to win the Eurovision\".'\n\nIn the bizarre rant, he reportedly went on to say: 'Do we need somebody now to shove this orientation in our faces to get votes. And [they] spoke about you know that [they are] neither here nor there - adults who know what I'm talking about. [They're] sort of somewhere in the middle... binary, non-binary I can't get my head around. It reminds me of bale, hay or straw. But that's okay too. I have no problem.'\n\nAt the time, Bambie laughed on X: 'They're making sermons about Bambie Thug,' and has since vowed to Metro.co.uk that they'll 'put more queer everywhere'.\n\n'It is wild,' Bambie reflected on the 'sermon', explaining: 'I really only started going back to Ireland this year, I've lived in London for 11 years, and I think in a queer bubble you forget that a lot of the world is backwards in their consciousness.\n\n'It was like as if I was watching something from 15 years ago, they had a whole sermon about me which is great, you know, they're talking about that in the Church, but... it's funny to think that they're still having these conversations because the whole thing wasn't even about my gender identity.\n\n'It was the fact that I had the word queer on my back of my coat, that's what he was talking about. And I'm just like, it's 2024.\n\n'Also, I just don't understand how you can be a preacher for a religion and then try and parade this religion as all loving and all this and then act like that, which I see like a lot from people who are very staunch in their beliefs sometimes and it just doesn't really add up for me.\n\n'So I don't know, he can watch while I do amazing and put more queer everywhere.'\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Finals air on Tuesday, May 7, and Thursday, May 9, at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer. The Grand Final airs on Saturday, May 11, at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us

The city also hosted Eurovision in 1992 and in 2013.\n\nSweden has hosted Eurovision seven times in total, counting in 2024. Stockholm, the capital, hosted the competition in 1975, 2000, and 2016 and Gothenburg in 1985.\n\nThe concert venue is Malm\u00f6 Arena with a capacity of up to 15,500.\n\nHOW DOES VOTING WORK?\n\nViewers decide the results of the two semi-finals and can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or via a Eurovision app.\n\nViewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 are eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nViewers in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 are eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain.\n\nIn the final, audience votes will make up half of the result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country will make up the other half.\n\nThe juries will rank the songs based on composition and originality of the song, quality of the stage performance, the artists' vocal capacity, and their overall impression of the act.\n\nEach country will award points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12.\n\nNon-participating countries around the world will also be able to vote, and will collectively have the weight of one additional voting country.\n\nNew to this year's Eurovision, viewers outside the participating countries can vote 24 hours prior each semi-final and the Grand final.\n\nWHO COMPETES IN THE FIRST SEMI-FINAL?\n\nCyprus, Serbia, Lithuania, Ireland, Ukraine, Poland, Croatia, Iceland, Slovenia, Finland, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Australia, Portugal, and Luxembourg.\n\nWHO COMPETES IN THE SECOND SEMI-FINAL?\n\nMalta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands.\n\nWHO COMPETES IN THE GRAND FINAL?\n\nThe top 10 from each semi-final will participate in the final.\n\nThe previous year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThere will be 26 acts in total in the final.\n\nWHY THE 'BIG FIVE'?\n\nThe \"Big Five\" countries are France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which bring the biggest financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\nSince 2000, these countries have secured themselves an automatic spot in the Grand Final.\n\nHOW TO WATCH IT\n\nThe song contest will be broadcast by all 37 participating countries. It will also be streamed on YouTube.\n\nWHO IS THE FAVOURITE TO WIN EUROVISION?\n\nBookmakers have Croatia, Switzerland and Ukraine as the top three favourites to win, while streaming data from Spotify suggests a strong chance for the Netherlands, Italy or host nation Sweden.\n\nWHO ARE THE PRESENTERS?\n\nThe song contest will be presented by Swedish comedian and actress Petra Mede and Swedish-American actress Malin \u00c5kerman.\n\nEUROVISION HISTORY\n\nThe Eurovision song contest is one of the world's largest television events, and has been held annually since 1956.\n\nEurovision features live music performances from most European countries and beyond, including Israel and Australia.\n\nOriginally it started as a technical experiment for transnational broadcast television with only seven countries competing: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy.\n\nThe show reached 162 million people in 2023 through public service markets.\n\nWHICH COUNTRIES HAVE WON THE MOST EUROVISIONS?\n\nSweden and Ireland are leading with seven wins each. France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have each won five times, with the Netherlands as the most recent of the four countries to win in 2019.\n\nWHO WON LAST YEAR?\n\nSwedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool for the second time with her song \"Tattoo\". She is the only person after Ireland's Johnny Logan to win the contest twice.\n\n(Reporting by Isabelle Yr Carlsson and Louise Breusch Rasmussen; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen, Sharon Singleton

Roughly 100,000 visitors from 89 countries are expected in host city Malmo during the week for the 68th edition of the competition, along with large protests against Israel's participation due to the war in Gaza.\n\nWHEN IS THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2024? The event kicked off on Tuesday with the first semi-final, and will be followed by a second semi-final on Thursday.\n\nThe Grand Final will be held on Saturday, May 11 at 1900 GMT.\n\nWHERE IS EUROVISION BEING HELD?\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 is taking place in Malmo, Sweden's third-largest city with a population of 362,000. The city also hosted Eurovision in 1992 and in 2013. Sweden has hosted Eurovision seven times in total, counting 2024. Stockholm, the capital, hosted the competition in 1975, 2000 and 2016 and Gothenburg in 1985. The concert venue is the Malmo Arena which has a capacity of up to 15,500.\n\nWHAT DEMONSTRATIONS ARE EXPECTED? Several protests are planned in central Malmo this week after organizer European Broadcasting Union (EBU) resisted calls to exclude Israel over its devastating military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Protests against Israel's participation which are expected to draw tens of thousands of people are scheduled for 1300 GMT on Thursday and Saturday. Pro-Israel supporters have planned a protest for Thursday at 1600 GMT. A vessel from Swedish NGO 'Ship to Gaza' is scheduled to arrive in Malmo harbour on Wednesday, with a call for solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nWHAT SECURITY MEASURES ARE TAKEN?\n\nSwedish police said security will be higher than in 2013 when Malmo last hosted the Eurovision. It has been reinforced by officers from neighbouring Denmark and Norway.\n\nAuthorities have said the threat level for terrorist or cyber attacks is high.\n\nVisitors will have to pass through metal detectors before entering Malmo arena, and will not be allowed to bring bags into the venue.\n\nOnly the national flags of the participating countries and the Pride flag are allowed inside the venue, while flags, symbols, clothing, items and banners likely to be to used promote other causes during the TV broadcast will be removed.\n\nHOW DOES VOTING WORK?\n\nViewers decide the results of the two semi-finals and can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or via a Eurovision app. Viewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 were eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nViewers in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 are eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain.\n\nIn the final, audience votes will make up half of the result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country will make up the other half.\n\nThe juries will rank the songs based on composition and originality of the song, quality of the stage performance, the artists' vocal capacity, and their overall impression of the act.\n\nEach country will award points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12.\n\nNon-participating countries around the world will also be able to vote, and will collectively have the weight of one additional voting country.\n\nNew to this year's Eurovision, viewers outside the participating countries can vote 24 hours prior each semi-final and the Grand final.\n\nWHO SECURED A SPOT IN THE GRAND FINAL FOLLOWING THE FIRST SEMI-FINAL?\n\nCroatia, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Ukraine.\n\nAustralia, Azerbaijan, Iceland, Moldova, and Poland did not make it through to the final.\n\nWHO WILL COMPETE IN THE SECOND SEMI-FINAL ON THURSDAY?\n\nMalta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands.\n\nWHO COMPETES IN THE GRAND FINAL?\n\nThe top 10 from each semi-final will participate in the final.\n\nLast year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThere will be 26 acts in total in the final.\n\nWHY THE 'BIG FIVE'? The \"Big Five\" countries are France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which make the biggest financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\nSince 2000, these countries have secured themselves an automatic spot in the Grand Final.\n\nHOW TO WATCH IT\n\nThe song contest will be broadcast by all 37 participating countries. It will also be streamed on YouTube.\n\nWHO IS THE FAVOURITE TO WIN EUROVISION?\n\nBookmakers have Croatia, Switzerland, Italy, Ukraine and Ireland as the top five favourites to win, while streaming data from Spotify also suggests a strong chance for the Netherlands or host nation Sweden.\n\nWHO ARE THE PRESENTERS?\n\nThe song contest will be presented by Swedish comedian and actress Petra Mede and Swedish-American actress Malin Akerman.\n\nEUROVISION HISTORY\n\nThe Eurovision song contest is one of the world's largest television events, and has been held annually since 1956.\n\nEurovision features live music performances from most European countries and beyond, including Israel and Australia.\n\nOriginally it started as a technical experiment for transnational broadcast television with only seven countries competing: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy.\n\nThe show reached 162 million people in 2023 through public service markets.\n\nWHICH COUNTRIES HAVE WON THE MOST EUROVISIONS?\n\nSweden and Ireland are leading with seven wins each. France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have each won five times, with the Netherlands as the most recent of the four countries to win in 2019.\n\nWHO WON LAST YEAR?\n\nSwedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool for the second time with her song \"Tattoo\". She is the only person after Ireland's Johnny Logan to win the contest twice.

scarfs", "body": "Eurovision's organisers have said they \"regret\" that an artist chose to wear a Keffiyeh at the event's opening performances on Tuesday night.\n\nSwedish pop star Eric Saade, who is of Palestinian origin, donned the scarf on his wrist as he opened the first semi-final of the 68th Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden.\n\nThe Middle Eastern headdress has become a commonly used symbol of pro-Palestinian support throughout the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas and is frequently worn by demonstrators worldwide.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, said: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show.\n\n\"All performers are made aware of the rules of the Contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nSaade was among three former contestants who kicked off the first Eurovision semi-final in Malm\u00f6 amid heightened tensions over Israel's involvement.\n\nSaade, who was placed third for Sweden in 2011, has condemned the EBU's handling of this year's controversy and has repeatedly stated he opposes Israel's involvement in the competition.\n\nSimilarly to Saade, an American Eurovision fan worked her way around the organiser's Palestinian flag ban by donning a distinctive Keffiyeh over her outfit.\n\nMonica Ruiz, a 33-year-old library worker from Boston, chose to wear the scarf around her shoulders and paired it with large watermelon earrings, also a symbol used in pro-Palestine protests.\n\n\"It's very complicated this year,\" the Eurovision attendee told The Telegraph, explaining that many people will have \"strong feelings\" about the controversy surrounding Israel's involvement.\n\nShe said: \"We have friends who have bowed out of participating in any Eurovision this year in response to the inclusion [of Israel].\n\n\"I think that personally, it is hard to see a country be celebrated on an international stage while they are also being tried for genocide by the International Criminal Court.\"\n\nExplaining her decision to make a political statement at the music event, she said: \"As a person with Indigenous roots, I am going to stand for Indigenous rights around the world.\"\n\nIn late January, the UN-run International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel must act to prevent genocide in Gaza but stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire after South Africa brought a case against the country.\n\nOnly flags of participating countries are allowed\n\nThe 68th Eurovision Song Contest has been plagued by rows over Israel's participation amid the country's ongoing military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, now in its seventh month.\n\nOrganisers announced last week that they reserve the right to remove any Palestinian flags and pro-Palestine symbols at the show this week in Sweden, reinforcing that it is a non-political event.\n\nMichelle Roverelli, the head of communications for event organisers the EBU, said ticket holders are only allowed to bring and display flags representing countries that take part in the event, as well as the rainbow-coloured flag.\n\nIt came after more than 1,000 Swedish musicians wrote an open letter calling for Israel to be banned.\n\nAt the event, which runs from Tuesday to Sunday, pro-Palestinian groups are expected to stage large protests in Malm\u00f6 to raise awareness of the cause and demonstrate against Israel's involvement.\n\nThe involvement of Eden Golan, this year's performer for Israel, while the war in Gaza continues has divided politicians and celebrities.\n\nThe 20-year-old will perform the song October Rain, which was taken by some to be a reference to the Hamas attack of October 7, on Thursday.\n\nUK in first semi-final\n\nMeanwhile, this year's first semi-final on Tuesday night saw performances by Ireland's non-binary contestant, Bambi Thug, as well as Olly Alexander for the UK.\n\nThe Years & Years singer, 33, previously sparked an anti-semitism row after The Telegraph revealed he had signed a letter calling Israel an \"apartheid regime\" and condemning \"Zionist propaganda\".\n\nHe broke down in tears during an interview with The Times, published last week, in which he addressed the controversy and said he had \"struggled\" during a performance at a pre-Eurovision party.\n\nHe has since said he respects fans who are boycotting the competition but branded attacks on him \"extreme.\"\n\nThe first night also saw performances by Ukraine's duo Jerry Heil and Alyona Alyona and Croatia's Baby Lasagna, who is tipped as a potential favourite to win.\n\nIsrael has qualified for every Eurovision final since 2015. It came third last year, with its most recent win coming in 2018 with Netta Barzilai's song Toy.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors":

Their act, Electric Fields, failed to qualify, as did entries from Moldova and Iceland.\n\nMeanwhile, organisers had to apologise after one of Tuesday's performers displayed a pro-Palestinian symbol.\n\nEric Saade, who was among the show's opening acts, wore a keffiyeh - a type of scarf commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian - on his arm.\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show.\n\n\"All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nAhead of the event at Sweden's Malm\u00f6 Arena, fans were warned not to bring Palestinian flags, symbols or bags into the audience. Strict security checks were carried out on members of the audience.\n\nThe run-up to the contest has been characterised by opposition to Israel's participation, amid concerns over the humanitarian cost of the war in Gaza.\n\nIreland's Bambi told reporters they were \"ordered\" to remove political gestures from their outfit ahead of the semi-final performance.\n\nTheir costume had originally included an ancient Celtic writing known as Ogham - which they said had spelt \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine\".\n\nOgham is an ancient Irish alphabet, represented by a series of marks on stones and it is the earliest written source of the Irish Language, dating back to the 4th Century AD.\n\n\"It was very important for me because I am pro-justice and pro-peace, unfortunately I had to change those messages today... [an] order from the EBU,\" Bambie said.\n\nIsrael's representative, 21-year-old Eden Golan, has reportedly been confined to her hotel room while she is not performing, due to heightened security concerns.\n\nShe will make her debut during Thursday's second semi-final.\n\nThe political row did not overshadow Tuesday's opening semi-final, where 18 acts performed, including the UK's entrant Olly Alexander - who has previously called for \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire\" in Gaza, but refused calls to boycott the event.\n\nThe singer put on an energetic performance of his synth-pop single Dizzy, using camera effects and intricate choreography to make it look as though he was in a spaceship hurtling towards earth.\n\nDressed in a white singlet, red trousers, and distressed boots, he danced so hard that the battery pack for his microphone detached from his costume. He was seen clasping it in his right hand for the final moments of the performance.\n\nDespite the mishap, the UK did not have to worry about the public vote on Tuesday. It is one of five countries that qualifies automatically for the final, due to its financial contribution to the contest.\n\nSweden, who were last year's winners, also get a free pass.\n\nThe 10 acts who succeeded in Tuesday's public vote were:\n\nGoing home were Moldova, Iceland, Australia, Poland and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe results were something of a shock for Iceland's Hera Bj\u00f6rk and Moldova's Natalia Burdu.\n\nBoth were former Eurovision contestants, who were hoping to capitalise on their association with the contest, and perhaps improve upon their previous scores.\n\nHowever, it was not to be. Their songs were ranked poorly with bookmakers and fans alike and, in the end, the public vote could not save them.\n\nCroatia's Baby Lasagna are currently the favourites, and they sailed through the semi-final with the agreeably daft foot-stomper Rim Tim Tagi Dim.\n\nThe song tells the story of a farm boy setting out for the big city (sample lyric: \"I'm a big boy now and I sold my cow\") - and is allegedly about the damaging effects of Croatia's brain drain.\n\nEqually entertaining is Finland's Windows95Man, who spends his stage time \"arguing\" with Eurovision officials about whether he can perform naked from the waist down.\n\nA well-known performance artist and DJ at home, he makes ample use of stage props to cover his modesty... before triumphantly donning a pair of jean-shorts for the song's climax.\n\nLuxembourg, meanwhile, made a triumphant return to Eurovision after a gap of 31 years.\n\nThe country, which has won five times, pulled out after being disqualified from the 1994 contest and resisted attempts to lure them back... Until now.\n\nMarking the 40th anniversary of their last win, they entered the slinky pop anthem Fighter, sung by 23-year-old Tali Golergant - and duly went through to the final.\n\nIreland will also be delighted by their success. Tied with Sweden as the most successful country in Eurovision history (with seven wins each), it has failed to qualify in eight of the last 10 competitions.\n\nThe selection of Bambie Thug, a non-binary artist whose song dabbles in the occult, was condemned by some priests in the predominantly Catholic country - but its creative staging and unlikely fusion of musical genres have made it a favourite amongst fans.\n\n\"I wanted to showcase all the facets of myself like spoken word poetry, singing, jazzy crooning, metal, screaming, I squeeze it all in,\" Bambie told the BBC earlier this week.\n\nThe first semi-final was themed around the idea that \"you don't have to win the contest to be a winner\".\n\nAs a result, organisers asked back some of the competition's most famous runners-up, including Eleni Foureira (Cyprus, 2018), Eric Saade (Sweden, 2001) and Chanel (Spain, 2022) - all of whom have gone on to achieve international success.\n\nThe trio opened the show with a medley of their Eurovision songs; while the interval saw the return of Sweden's Benjamin Ingrosso.\n\nThe singer came seventh at the 2018 contest - a respectable placing, unless you come from Europe's most competitive Eurovision participant.\n\n\"In Sweden, if you don't come top five, you're the worst, so I was a disappointment,\" Ingrosso recently told the official Eurovision Song Contest podcast.\n\nDespite the ignominy, his career has gone from strength to strength - and he recently enjoyed a viral hit with the slinky pop song, Kite.\n\nBut the real star of the half-time show was Ireland's Johnny Logan.\n\nThe crooner was the first person ever to win Eurovision twice, with What's Another Year in 1980 and Hold Me Now in 1987.\n\nHe travelled to Malm\u00f6 to honour Swedish pop diva Loreen, who last year equalled his Eurovision record with her second victory.\n\nOn stage, he sang a lush, orchestral version of her 2012 entry Euphoria.\n\nBehind the scenes, he has also praised Ireland's entry, calling Bambie Thug a potential winner.\n\n\"The one thing about the Eurovision Song Contest is that every year people try to copy the song that won before, because they think that's the secret to winning it,\" he told Ireland's Sunday World newspaper.\n\n\"This year's Irish entry doesn't do that. It's probably the best and most original entry that Ireland has had for as long as I can remember.\"\n\nThe audience will get to decide whether he's right at Eurovision's grand final on Sunday night.\n\nBefore then, however, is Thursday's second semi-final.\n\nThere, 16 acts will compete for the remaining 10 places in the contest - including hotly-tipped singers from Finland (Nemo), Israel (Eden Golan) and Greece (Marina Satti).\n\nSweden is hosting the contest in the coastal city of Malm\u00f6.\n\nIt follows in the footsteps of Liverpool, which held last year's competition on behalf of 2022 winners Ukraine, who were unable to do so during the ongoing war with Russia.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Surveillance cameras have been installed near the concert venue and police said officers will use drones to monitor crowds, with attendees expected to pass through airport-style security controls including scanners and no bags allowed.\n\nSweden was already on high alert with the terror threat level at four out of five following a spate of Quran-burning incidents that have sparked outrage and triggered protests in many Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office issued a new travel warning on Wednesday for anyone travelling to Sweden during Eurovision, saying clashes were possible where \"more than one protest happens at the same time, on opposing issues\".\n\nJimmy Modin, a spokesperson for the Swedish police, told that the protests in Malmo this week presented no specific threat to the Eurovision contest.\n\n\"We can never rule out that anything could happen,\" he said, but added: \"At this point there is nothing that points to the demonstrations getting out of hand or becoming violent.\n\n\"There has been a couple of months where we had a lot of demonstrations in Malmo and some of them have been loud, but they have largely gone without disturbances of the peace.\"\n\nOn the presence of armed officers, he said: \"Police officers in Sweden are always carrying a weapon, some of our patrols during Eurovision will have bigger, heavier weaponry. But it's nothing to be alarmed about, it's just precaution from our side.\n\n\"We want to make everybody feel safe and secure and focus on having a good time during Eurovision.\"\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war is the second conflict to rock the colourful song competition, after Russia was expelled in 2022 over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCampaigners have pointed to what they describe as the hypocrisy of allowing Israel to compete in Eurovision, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comes under increasing pressure to not go ahead with a planned offensive in the southern Gazan city of Rafah.\n\nThe war has killed more than 34,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and has driven some 80 per cent of Gaza's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes. About 1.3 million Palestinians have sought refuge in Rafah.\n\nMr Netanyahu has insisted on carrying out military offensives to destroy the Hamas militant group in Gaza, following the 7 October attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 taken hostage.\n\nEurovision bills itself as a non-political event and says its rules does not allow political statements or even slogans.\n\nIt did not stop Eric Saade, a former Swedish Eurovision contestant, from wearing a keffiyeh, a scarf associated with the Palestinian cause, around his wrist as he performed in Tuesday's show. Afterwards, organisers said: \"We regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nBambie Thug, the first Irish Eurovision Song Contest finalist since 2018, criticised organisers for asking them to alter a pro-Palestinian message. The 31-year-old said they were forced to change their body paint in Ogham script - an early medieval alphabet - which translated to ceasefire and freedom, a nod to the situation in Gaza. EBU said it was against the rules.\n\nMs Golan, 20, was asked to change her original song \"October Rain\" after it caused controversy, as the lyrics were thought to reference the 7 October Hamas attacks. She has reportedly been advised to remain in her hotel room for the duration of her visit in Malmo, aside from performances and official events, following death threats online.\n\nJewish Eurovision fans have described feeling anxious about displaying obvious signs of their support for Israel in Malmo. \"We will be 'toned down', we won't speak in Hebrew out on the streets as loudly as we are used to, nor will we walk around with an Israeli flag,\" Miki Israeli, who flew to the city with her friends, told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.\n\nProtester Ms Jacobsen expressed sadness over reports that Jewish people felt unsafe in Malmo, saying the demonstrations were \"not against Jews\".\n\n\"The only thing we want to do is to tell the world to not forget Palestine, show the Palestinian people that they are not alone,\" she added.\n\nPlanning for the demonstrations in Malmo has been ongoing for months, with the campaign increasing in number with \"more and more organisations standing behind our platform\", Ms Jacobsen said.\n\nThe protest on Saturday will go ahead even if Israel do not make it to the final, she added.\n\nShe said the demonstrations, which will take place in central Malmo away from the Eurovision venue, will be peaceful, as supporters wanted to highlight how \"absurd\" it was for Israel to particiapte in the competition when it was \"committing a genocide\" against the Palestinian people.\n\n\"It makes us feel sick that they are allowed to participate during those circumstances,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType":

The city also hosted Eurovision in 1992 and in 2013.\n\nSweden has hosted Eurovision seven times in total, counting 2024. Stockholm, the capital, hosted the competition in 1975, 2000 and 2016 and Gothenburg in 1985.\n\nThe concert venue is the Malmo Arena which has a capacity of up to 15,500.\n\nSeveral protests are planned in central Malmo this week after organizer European Broadcasting Union (EBU) resisted calls to exclude Israel over its devastating military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nProtests against Israel's participation which are expected to draw tens of thousands of people are scheduled for 1300 GMT on Thursday and Saturday. Pro-Israel supporters have planned a protest for Thursday at 1600 GMT.\n\nA vessel from Swedish NGO 'Ship to Gaza' is scheduled to arrive in Malmo harbour on Wednesday, with a call for solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nSwedish police said security will be higher than in 2013 when Malmo last hosted the Eurovision. It has been reinforced by officers from neighbouring Denmark and Norway.\n\nAuthorities have said the threat level for terrorist or cyber attacks is high.\n\nVisitors will have to pass through metal detectors before entering Malmo arena, and will not be allowed to bring bags into the venue.\n\nOnly the national flags of the participating countries and the Pride flag are allowed inside the venue, while flags, symbols, clothing, items and banners likely to be to used promote other causes during the TV broadcast will be removed.\n\nViewers decide the results of the two semi-finals and can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or via a Eurovision app.\n\nViewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 were eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nViewers in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 are eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain.\n\nIn the final, audience votes will make up half of the result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country will make up the other half.\n\nThe juries will rank the songs based on composition and originality of the song, quality of the stage performance, the artists' vocal capacity, and their overall impression of the act.\n\nNon-participating countries around the world will also be able to vote, and will collectively have the weight of one additional voting country.\n\nNew to this year's Eurovision, viewers outside the participating countries can vote 24 hours prior each semi-final and the Grand final.\n\nWHO SECURED A SPOT IN THE GRAND FINAL FOLLOWING THE FIRST SEMI-FINAL?\n\nCroatia, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Ukraine.\n\nAustralia, Azerbaijan, Iceland, Moldova, and Poland did not make it through to the final.\n\nWHO WILL COMPETE IN THE SECOND SEMI-FINAL ON THURSDAY?\n\nMalta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe top 10 from each semi-final will participate in the final.\n\nLast year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe \"Big Five\" countries are France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which make the biggest financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\nSince 2000, these countries have secured themselves an automatic spot in the Grand Final.\n\nThe song contest will be broadcast by all 37 participating countries. It will also be streamed on YouTube.\n\nBookmakers have Croatia, Switzerland, Italy, Ukraine and Ireland as the top five favourites to win, while streaming data from Spotify also suggests a strong chance for the Netherlands or host nation Sweden.\n\nThe song contest will be presented by Swedish comedian and actress Petra Mede and Swedish-American actress Malin Akerman.\n\nThe Eurovision song contest is one of the world's largest television events, and has been held annually since 1956.\n\nEurovision features live music performances from most European countries and beyond, including Israel and Australia.\n\nOriginally it started as a technical experiment for transnational broadcast television with only seven countries competing: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy.\n\nThe show reached 162 million people in 2023 through public service markets.\n\nSweden and Ireland are leading with seven wins each. France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have each won five times, with the Netherlands as the most recent of the four countries to win in 2019.\n\nSwedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool for the second time with her song \"Tattoo\". She is the only person after Ireland's Johnny Logan to win the contest twice.\n\n(Reporting by Isabelle Yr Carlsson and Louise Breusch Rasmussen; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen, Sharon Singleton,

It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nHe also noted the EBU, an apolitical member organisation, is \"in line\" with other international federations including sports bodies who are allowing Israel to participate in events.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nIn March, Alexander along with Irish hopeful Bambie Thug and other Eurovision artists released a joint statement, backing \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire\" but refusing to boycott the event.\n\nThat same month, Israel unveiled its new entry song as Hurricane, performed by singer Eden Golan.\n\nHer original track, October Rain, had caused controversy as the lyrics were thought to reference the Hamas attacks of 7 October before being changed following the backlash.\n\nDiscussing the backlash, De Tender said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan, which is the Israeli public broadcaster, met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\nIn 2022, EBU announced that Russia would no longer be participating in Eurovision following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA statement at the time said the EBU's executive board had made the decision following a recommendation by the Eurovision governing body, known as the reference group, based on \"the rules of the event and the values of the EBU\".\n\nOn Sunday, De Tender said the situation between Russia and Israel was \"different\" as in Russia's case there was a \"broad consensus within the membership of the EBU that they could not participate\".\n\nHe added that the three Russian members of the EBU had already been \"excluded\" from the EBU membership in the weeks after the war broke out due to breaching \"member obligations\".\n\nThe 37 Eurovision entries are set to perform across two semi-finals next week on Tuesday and Thursday in a bid to compete for a place in the grand final on Saturday.\n\nIreland's Bambie Thug will perform fourth in the first semi-final on Tuesday.\n\nDe Tender said the preparations are going \"very well\" as they have been planning the music spectacle in Sweden for the past year after Loreen won the competition with her hit song Tattoo.\n\nSource: Press

Over 1,000 artists in the host country signed a letter calling for Israel's disqualification for its \"brutal warfare in Gaza,\" according to the Guardian, and pro-Palestinian groups are lobbying state broadcasters not to air the event and calling on artists to refuse to participate.\n\nAlready, Swedish pop star Eric Saade appeared wearing a keffiyeh -- a traditional scarf that has come to symbolize resistance to Israel's incursion into Gaza -- around his wrist during a performance on Tuesday night. A spokesperson for European Broadcasting Union (EBU) -- which organizes the event -- issued their \"regrets\" over the decision, according to the BBC. Saade has appeared as a Eurovision competitor before but was a guest performer last night.\n\nPolitics intruding on Eurovision isn't new, despite its stated desire to stay above the fray.\n\nIn 2022, the contest disqualified Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNonetheless, the EBU has rejected demands from pro-Palestinian activists, maintaining that it is a music event that keeps political messages away from the stage. Sweden will bring additional police from Denmark and Norway to Malmo, and the Eurovision Song Contest is expected to continue with the usual participants, including Israel, which has won Eurovision four times since joining the contest in 1973.\n\nThe EBU did require Israel to revise its entry this year, though, which was a song initially called \"October Rain,\" featuring the lyrics \"those that write history, stand with me.\" The song appeared to be a reference to Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that killed more than 1,100 people and led to the kidnapping of some 240, dozens of whom are still held hostage.\n\nThe reference to the attack was deemed too political by the EBU, and thus ineligible for the competition. Israel initially refused to sanitize its entry, even threatening to pull out of the competition, but revised it after involvement from President Isaac Herzog. The new song, which will be performed by Eden Golan, is now a romantic ballad entitled \"Hurricane,\" and the opening line was changed to \"writer of my symphony, play with me.\"\n\nThe controversy over Israel's song and the protests looming over this year's event underscore how much politics encroaches on an event that seeks to promote a utopian vision of global comity. But as Tess Megginson, a PhD candidate studying European history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, argues, the song contest, founded during the Cold War with seven European countries and initially excluding the Soviet Union, has always been a space for political performance. In an interview with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram, she explained that while some of today's controversy is unique, the contest had some of its most contentious political moments after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You can listen to a longer version of Megginson's interview and highlights from Eurovision on Today, Explained. -- Haleema Shah, producer\n\nYou wrote in the Washington Post that politics at Eurovision is nothing new, using the '90s as an example.\n\nI would argue the 1990s are actually some of the most political years of the contest, and this actually isn't always a bad thing.\n\nAs soon as you have the Eastern European countries start joining, hosts are talking about welcome to the rest of Europe, and now we're finally unified. And you have all these songs about peace and unity and breaking down walls. Some of these do quite well in the contest, some of them don't. In 1990, the first competition held in Eastern Europe, in Zagreb, the winning entry was Italy with \"Insieme: 1992.\" The hook in the chorus is \"unite, unite Europe,\" and it got a very good reception and won the competition.\n\nIt is a really beautiful time in the contest, but also in the '90s you have the Yugoslav wars. And this is the first time that we actually see a country banned from the competition. Yugoslavia was banned from the contest shortly after the 1992 competition because of the siege of Sarajevo. UN sanctions are imposed against Yugoslavia, and Bosnia is able to participate in the competition, but Yugoslavia cannot. Even though Bosnia is not participating with a song entry, they're still able to vote in the contest [and] call into the contest while under siege.\n\nWow.\n\nThe phone line initially disconnects and it goes dead. And there's just this silence that falls over the audience. Soon they're able to reconnect, and there's a loud applause and cheering from the audience as they're able to give their points for the contest. It's a really beautiful moment of solidarity for people who were at war and under occupation. And it's something that, even though it's a very political moment, it's quite a beautiful moment in the contest's history.\n\nThese political moments we're talking about -- the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fall of communism, the genocide in Bosnia -- they all happened on the continent of Europe. But here, now, in 2024, we've got this controversy and calls for a boycott that relate to something happening in the Middle East. Is there a precedent for that at Eurovision?\n\nYeah. Boycotts in Eurovision are almost as old as the contest itself, starting in the 1970s. In 1975, Turkey invaded Cyprus, and Greece boycotted the contest. The following year, Greece submits a song that is a very anti-war song and clearly referencing Turkey's presence in Cyprus, and Turkey boycotts the contest. So that's kind of the first example we see of these big boycotts.\n\nMore recently [there have] been calls to boycott Azerbaijan because of their treatment of their viewers who vote for Armenia. They've threatened to block the Armenian broadcast before. And of course, when they hosted the contest in 2012, there was a big outcry because they displaced a lot of people living in a community in Baku because they were building a stadium just to host the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd then of course, Russia's the big one that you see a lot in the conversation because of its invasion of Ukraine, finally banned from the competition in 2022.\n\nIt sounds like it's par for the course to have this level of controversy and calls for boycotts and tensions between nations at Eurovision. Does that make this current controversy less exceptional?\n\nNot necessarily. I think there's also been a long and unique history with Israel's participation in the contest. As the first non-European country to participate, it's also had relative success since it joined.\n\nIt's won the contest four times and hosted it three times. All the way back in 1978, we started seeing these controversies arise with Israel's participation. In 1978, they actually won the competition, but in Jordan, which was a member of the EBU, although not participating in the contest, they didn't air the Israel entry. And when it became clear that Israel was going to win the contest, they cut the broadcast short and announced Belgium as the winner in Jordan.\n\nWhat? They just lied?!\n\nYep, they lied to people in Jordan and said Belgium had won the contest. I don't know when they found out that wasn't true.\n\nWhen they got Wikipedia.\n\nYeah. Pre-Internet, it was a lot easier to get away with that sort of thing.\n\nHow does Eurovision typically handle the boycotts and the tensions between these nations?\n\nNot very well. They officially market themselves as an apolitical contest. So when politics enter the contest, they are not happy about it. One kind of fun example is in 2015, they introduced what they called \"anti-booing technology.\"\n\nYou couldn't hear the crowd booing the Russian entry during the contest. I don't think it's been used since then, but I wouldn't be surprised if they use a similar thing this year.\n\nAnd another thing is fines -- they do really like to fine their members. In 2019, when Israel hosted the contest, there were calls to boycott and move the contest out of Israel. Icelandic performers held up Palestinian flags and the Icelandic broadcaster ended up getting a huge fine from the EBU for doing that.\n\nDo you think Eurovision this year will end up transcending our current geopolitical situation?\n\nThere are a couple signs we can look for to see how Europeans are reacting to Israel's participation. The first is going to be the live audience reaction. This is going to be more difficult for us to see as viewers; we're probably going to have to rely on things like social media and journalists on the ground to hear how the audience is reacting to Israel participating.\n\nBut we're also going to see this maybe with the other performers, if they, say, wave Palestinian flags like we saw in 2019. Also, when the votes are given out at the end of the competition, are people going to boo countries that give Israel top votes? We'll have to see.\n\nA second thing, of course, is the popular vote. Will people vote for Israel or will this be a protest vote against them? If there's a big difference between the jury vote for Israel and the popular vote, that's probably a sign that people are not voting for Israel because they don't agree with what they're doing in Gaza.\n\nThe third thing to see is viewership. If the boycott is effective, there'll probably be a stark decline in viewership in certain countries. Obviously, there are other factors at play here. So if a country, a participant, doesn't make the finals, there could be a decline in viewership because of that, but if we see a significant decline, I would probably argue that it's the boycott.",

Spain and Sweden have participated 62 times. Norway, Finland, Ireland, Austria, Portugal and Denmark have participated more than 50 times. Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta also have a significant number of participants.\n\nSweden and Ireland have the most Eurovision wins with seven each. The UK has also won five times, but its withdrawal from the EU rules it out.\n\nOn the other hand, 18 countries have had the embarrassment of receiving zero points in the finals, led by Norway and Austria with four each.\n\nAccording to Eurovision data from the last decade,\n\nSweden and Italy are the main contenders for EU leadership in terms of total points,\n\nand Malta and Cyprus are also strong contenders. By contrast, Germany's position suggests that it should step back from the reins.\n\nAccording to Politico's calculations, Sweden should have 94 seats in the EP instead of the current 21, and Italy 80 instead of the current 76, but Germany should have only 12 instead of 96.\n\nLuxembourg and Slovakia are at the bottom of the rankings. Although Luxembourg currently have six and Slovakia 15 seats, they should both have only one seat. Luxembourg is participating in this year's contest, so it could move up, while Slovakia is not participating and has not done so since 2012.\n\nMeanwhile, Latvia should take 13 of the current nine seats.\n\nEurovision and the EU share common features, as both are exclusive clubs that enjoy enlargement.\n\nBut unlike EU accession talks, Eurovision accession talks move quickly and Eurovision, which started with just seven countries in 1956, has over the years had entries from 52 countries, not all of them European, but also, for example, Australia.\n\nOver the years, Sweden has been successful thanks to the broad support of voters from the bloc, which is predominantly made up of northern European allies, although this has caused some controversy, for example last year the public vote was in Finland's favour, but the jury's vote resulted in a win for Sweden's Loreen.\n\nUkraine has also received broad support from allies such as Lithuania, Poland and Italy, while Greece-Cyprus and Spain-Portugal still maintain traditional alliances.", "source": {"uri": "bnn-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia"}, "authors": [],

Learn more\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is back for its 68th year, and the 2024 competition takes viewers to Sweden. We've compiled everything you need to know about how to watch Eurovision from anywhere in the world.\n\nCreated in 1956, Eurovision originally had just seven countries submit songs to perform in competition with each other. Now, more than 30 countries compete yearly (this year, 37 countries will participate). Fans and juries from competing nations vote to determine the ultimate winner each year. Sweden's Loreen won the 2023 competition for her song \"Tattoo,\" and Ukraine and Italy won in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Ireland and Sweden hold the joint record for most Eurovision wins, with seven each.\n\nWith the exception of a 2020 Covid-related cancellation, the competition has been held every year since its inception, making it one of the most popular and longest-running non-sports-related annual competitions. If you can't wait to tune in, we've got you covered. Below, we have a breakdown of everything you need to know about watching Eurovision, including free live streaming options and a schedule for the week.\n\nPeacock is the US live streaming home to Eurovision. Plans start at $5.99 a month for the ad-supported tier. You can upgrade to an ad-free version for $11.99 a month. Peacock is the US streaming hub for many live global competitions and will provide extensive Olympics coverage later this summer.\n\nEurovision airs on the BBC in the UK. This means that viewers can live stream it for free through BBC iPlayer. You just need to create an account to start streaming this English language option.\n\nIn France, Eurovision will air on France TV. This free streaming option only requires you to register for an account, and then you're good to enjoy the competition.\n\nEurovision live streams on RTVE Play in Spain. This is another free streaming option that only requires account creation.\n\nIn addition to the global broadcasts, the competition will be live-streamed through Eurovision's YouTube channel in select regions (excluding the US and many other countries where a viewing option is available through traditional broadcasting methods). If you find yourself in an area where you can't access any Eurovision streams or hope to tap into one of the above methods, you can try out a VPN.\n\nShort for virtual private networks, VPNs are handy tools to temporarily alter your device's virtual location so that you can access websites that vary in availability from region to region. VPNs are popular options for people looking to boost their online privacy and have access to their usual websites and apps while traveling. Interested in learning more? Our go-to recommendation is ExpressVPN, a beginner-friendly option with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

A group of enthusiasts, adorned in sequins and sparkles inspired by the competition, arrived at Copenhagen airport before making their way to the venue in Malmo ahead of the semi-final.\n\nThe die-hard fans boarded an easyJet flight, the official airline of the contest, from London Gatwick at the break of dawn which quickly turned into a singalong to kickstart the festivities. The flight featured a dedicated themed baggage drop, fancy dress, and a talent show at 40,000 feet, hosted by Drag Race star Tia Kofi.\n\nOne of the Eurovision devotees who made the journey said: \"The flight laid on for us today was the ultimate treat for any Eurovision fan who loves to celebrate the glitz, glamour, and unity of Eurovision. I can't believe what an amazing experience it's been so far, and we haven't even left the airport yet.\"\n\nThis comes after a survey found that six and a half million Brits will be attending a Eurovision party this year. More than a third (35 per cent) of the 2,000 adults surveyed will be tuning into the singing contest this year, with 36 per cent of those either hosting their own festivities or celebrating at someone else's home.\n\nAnd one in five will be dressed in iconic Eurovision looks - with D'Nash, the 2007 Spanish entrant, Brotherhood of Man, the UK winners of 1976, and Ireland's 2021 entrant, Jedward, being the most popular.\n\nFollowing closely are costumes inspired by Belarus' 3 + 2, the legendary Swedish band ABBA and Celine Dion's 1974 entry for France. In addition to dressing up, 38 per cent of fans will serve food inspired by the competing countries, such as Italy, Spain, and Greece.\n\nMichael Brown, director of cabin services at easyJet, expressed: \"We are proud to be part of the Eurovision phenomenon, providing a glittering platform for fans to start their Eurovision journey. Our Super Fan Flight to Copenhagen promises to be a memorable adventure - a high-flying act of its own. Our mission is to connect people and cultures together, and we're proud to be the Official Airline of the Eurovision Song Contest who share this passion.\"\n\nThe study also revealed that 39 per cent of respondents love the Eurovision song contest, with 23 per cent becoming bigger fans after Liverpool hosted the event last year. The songs (31 per cent), commentary (24 per cent) and the outfits (21 per cent) are the top reasons why.\n\nFurthermore, 27 per cent have been inspired to visit new countries because of Eurovision, with Italy, Greece and Spain topping the list. It also emerged that 42 would enjoy being in the live audience due to the sense of unity between nations (21 per cent), celebrating diversity (19 per cent) and being around like-minded people (12 per cent).\n\nWhen it comes to the UK's entry this year, 64 per cent don't think we are likely to win, with 43 per cent attributing this to our poor track record.

In the initial number of three guests, three former Eurovision contestants who did not win the festival but obtained excellent results - the Spanish-Cuban Chanel Terrero, the Greek-Albanian Eleni Foureira and the Swede Eric Saade -, the Swedish performer appeared with a Palestinian scarf wrapped around the left wrist.\n\nWith the gala still underway, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was quick to regret what happened. A spokeswoman told reporters: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live television programme. \"All artists know the rules of the contest and we regret that Eric Saade has decided to compromise the apolitical nature of the event.\" Before the semi-final at the Malm\u00f6 Arena, the pavilion that hosts the galas during the week, Eurofans were warned not to bring Palestinian flags or symbols.\n\nEric Saade, whose mother is Swedish and whose father is Palestinian, sang Popular, the song with which he came third in Eurovision in 2011, with his scarf always visible, ignoring the express prohibition. On the same stage, Chanel, accompanied by twelve dancers, did a powerful reinterpretation of SloMo, the song with which she won third place in the 2022 contest. Eleni Foureira, who won second place for Cyprus in 2018, performed the explosive song Fuego that earned him that place in the record.\n\nAmong the ten representatives who managed to qualify for the final on Saturday the 11th thanks to the audience's televoting are two who appear in the quintet of favorites to win the crystal microphone, according to the betting houses: the Croatian Baby Lasagna and the Ukrainians Alyona Alyona\n\nThis last country returns to the Eurovision contest after 31 years of absence, being one of the seven founding countries of the festival and having won it five times. Luxembourg has managed to qualify with the singer Tali, who performs Fighter in French and English.\n\nEach one made themselves noticed in their own way, as expected, the representatives of Finland and Ireland. Finnish DJ and visual artist Windows95man sings the techno-inspired No Rules! and in the staging - in which he emerges from inside a kind of egg - he is wearing flesh-colored underwear that leads one to believe that he is not wearing them. The Irish Bambie Thug combines pop, rock, techno and derivatives singing at the top of her voice Doomsday Blue, an ode to the queer community with a stage design in which religious elements are appreciated.\n\nAlong with the other ten who qualify in the second semi-final (on Thursday the 9th) there will be 20 qualifiers who, added to the Big Five (Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom), who due to their greatest financial contribution to the European Union of Broadcasting (EBU) go directly to the final, like the host country, in this case Sweden, there will thus be 26 countries to compete in the grand final on Saturday.\n\nIn Thursday's semifinal, the representative of Israel, Eden Golan, competes to reach the final, who this week in Malm\u00f6 limits her outings beyond rehearsals and official appointments, due to the tension derived from Israel's participation in the musical contest while it continues. the deadly military campaign against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nViewers decide the results of the two semi-finals with their vote, and can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or through the Eurovision app. In the first semi-final, viewers from the 15 participating countries and those from three pre-qualified for the grand final voted: Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In the second semi-final this Thursday the 9th, the remaining countries of the total of 37 registered will vote.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release

Both are massive Eurovision fans and wanted to take their passion for pop - and journalism - to Sweden.\n\nREAD MORE: Who is Olly Alexander? UK Eurovision act at Malmo contest with song Dizzy Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nTurning to the University of Sunderland's Development Office for help, the brothers were able to apply for a Futures Fund scholarship. The Fund, which supports current University of Sunderland students and recent graduates, offers up to \u00a32,500 for students to develop their careers and aspirations.\n\nNow, after successfully gaining their University's support, Callum and James will be at the world's biggest showcase for pop music on Saturday May 11.\n\n\"Being in Malm\u00f6 means I have the chance to work closely with artists, songwriters, members of international broadcasting delegations and other industry professionals to help cement myself as a trusted member of the worlds of journalism and Eurovision,\" says Callum. \"When I graduate this summer having this trip to Sweden on my CV as a real-world example of working as a journalist will be a huge selling point as I take my first steps into my career.\"\n\nAlongside brother James, Callum produces weekly episodes of podcast The Euro Trip. He says: \"Each episode is listened to by more than 1,000 people. During Eurovision week last year, we made daily episodes which saw our episode listenership more than double.\"\n\n\"The Euro Trip is the world's leading independent Eurovision podcast,\" adds James. \"The podcast was something I started doing alongside my studies, using the skills I was learning on my course and applying them to the real world.\"\n\nJames now works as a freelance audio producer for BBC Sport, Radio Newcastle and Hits Radio North East, but he is still committed to working alongside his brother on their Eurovision podcast.\n\n\"The podcast is something I am hugely proud of,\" says James. \"I still use it as a calling card and it stands front and centre on my CV.\n\n\"Callum and I have become a trusted name within the Eurovision media space, often appearing on outlets such as BBC News as experts on the contest.\"\n\nBefore working as a freelance producer, James volunteered at the University's community radio station, Spark, and Callum is continuing that family tradition.\n\n\"I'll be reporting live on-air for Spark about everything happening in the world of Eurovision,\" he says. \"The University of Sunderland has given me so much so far, so I see it as vital for me to give back and continue to support the University.\n\n\"I pour every ounce of my enthusiasm for Eurovision, journalism and storytelling into the work I do. A week in Sweden doing what I love is the next step on my journey to become a full-time journalist.\"\n\nAlistair Robinson, Senior Lecturer in Journalism and Public Relations at the University of Sunderland, backed the brothers' funding application. He says: \"I'm delighted we've been able to help Callum and James with this opportunity. They are Eurovision experts and have developed an extraordinary specialism in Eurovision reporting.\n\n\"I've taught Callum for three years now and he has produced consistently excellent work, on a range of subjects, not just pop music or Eurovision. Since graduating, James has further honed his skills in the industry. They make a formidable team.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest final takes place in Malm\u00f6 in Sweden on Saturday May 11.", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kali_lindsay@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Kali Lindsay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sunderland", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Sunderland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunderland A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramlington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cramlington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cramlington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_broadcasting", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International broadcasting"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freelancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_Newcastle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio Newcastle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hits_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hits Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Community radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article29125222.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_KLR_NEC_070524_eurotwins.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1359, "textEnd": 1365, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The event's representatives said they were aware of the risks and have taken the necessary steps to address them.\n\n\"We are working closely with SVT's security team and the relevant authorities and expert partners to ensure we have the appropriate measures in place to protect from such risks,\" the song contest's spokesperson said in an email.\n\nThey said that Eurovision's partner responsible for the voting, the Germany-based firm Digame, undertakes \"great efforts\" to protect the competition's voting system. \"However, we can't divulge any information about the measures and processes that are implemented to safeguard the public vote,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nRon Meyran, the head of cyber intelligence at cybersecurity firm Radware, said network operators should be \"particularly concerned\" about protecting broadcast networks, streaming services, voting platforms, ticketing operations, control systems, and other related infrastructure.\n\n\"When successful, these types of threats can easily result in reputational loss and the promotion of political propaganda at an event that was created to unite people through music and art,\" Meyran said.\n\nOverall security has been tightened in Malm\u00f6, where some 100,000 visitors were expected for the Eurovision Song Contest and the largest ever police operation in southern Sweden was set in motion, including reinforcements from neighboring Denmark and Sweden.\n\nMix of threats\n\nWhile the police said there were no specific threats to Eurovision, Sweden has been on a terror level four out of five since August last year. The threat level was raised to \"high\" following a spate of Quran burnings in the country that angered the Muslim community.\n\nSweden was a \"priority target\" for violent jihadist groups, according to the police threat assessment for Eurovision.\n\nThe EBU's decision to allow Israel to participate in Eurovision has led to ire in some circles, with detractors accusing the organizers of double standards after Russia was banned from the competition in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe organizers said the situation between Russia and Israel was different and Eurovision was a \"non-political event.\"\n\nIn turn, Israel agreed to change its original entry called \"October Rain\" - widely interpreted as a reference to the October 7th Hamas attacks - into a more neutral \"Hurricane\" following a backlash.\n\nThe cybersecurity advisory released by Radware said Eurovision could be targeted by pro-Palestinian hacktivists, but also by Russia-linked threat actors over Sweden's support for Ukraine and the fact it has recently joined Nato.\n\n\"With attackers leveraging new tools and generative artificial intelligence to automate attacks, it has become increasingly easier for cybercriminals and even average citizens to carry out disruptive attacks,\" the advisory read.\n\n\"Toolkits, attack services and initial access are widely available for download or purchase across the internet and - as a result of the growing cyber conflict between Russia and the rest of the world - attack techniques have improved,\" it said.\n\nIn addition to cyberattacks, the Swedish police also cited general disruption and unrest as potential risks for Eurovision.\n\nOn Saturday, a large protest demanding Israel's removal from the contest is planned in Malm\u00f6, which is home to large Muslim and Palestinian communities. There are also calls to boycott Eurovision itself over its stance on Israel.\n\nHigh-profile targets\n\nCyberattacks are the \"main worry\" for organizers of Eurovision, the UK's national broadcaster BBC said last year when it hosted the event in Liverpool on behalf of Ukraine. Ukraine could not host the event itself due to the ongoing Russian invasion.\n\nThe Ukrainian folk-rap band Kalush Orchestra won the 2022 contest in Turin, Italy, which pro-Russian hacker group Killnet tried and failed to disrupt by launching a DDoS attack on the voting system. The Italian police said it had blocked its infiltration attempts.\n\nIn 2019, the hackers managed to disrupt the online stream of the Eurovision semi-finals in Israel by inserting warnings of a missile strike and images of blasts in Tel Aviv, the host city. The Israeli government blamed the incident on Hamas.\n\nOther high-profile entertainment and sports events will be facing an increased risk of cyberattacks this year. The Paris 2024 Olympics is getting ready for \"unprecedented\" cyberthreats, its organizers said.\n\nOrganized crime, activists, and state actors will be the main source of risks during the games later in the summer, they said.\n\nThey also said Paris 2024 was working \"hand in hand\" with the French National Agency for Information Security (ANSSI) and cybersecurity companies Cisco and Eviden to limit the impact of these potential attacks.\n\nWell-known European film festivals, including the Cannes Film Festival opening next week on May 14th, could also pose opportunities for threat

In a historic move for the contest, The Big Five and the host nation will perform regardless of their already qualifying conditions to evenly balance all of the acts in the eyes of the audience.\n\nEbba Adielsson, executive producer of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 said: \"We think that this change gives the Big Five countries and the host country a fairer playing field in the grand final, as they now have the opportunity to perform 'for real' on stage in the semi-finals.\n\n\"It is also a win for both the audience in the arena and the viewers at home, in that they get to see all the acts competing this year live before the grand final.\" You can keep up to date with the latest TV and showbiz news by signing up to the newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_cook@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Sam Cook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graham Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Busking_and_Street_Performing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Busking and Street Performing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article24894396.ece/alternates/s1200/2_glastonbury-festival-2022-day-five.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 134, "textEnd": 140}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 320, "textEnd": 325}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 365, "textEnd": 370}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The Eurovision Song Contest, a springboard to fame for some of the biggest acts in the world - legendary Swedish band ABBA, or more recently, Italian glam rock band M\u00e5neskin, for example - will return to screens on Saturday, May 11, to do what it does best: providing the most eccentric performances Europe has to offer.\n\nFrom perfectly garish outfits and heartfelt ballads to synchronized dance numbers and heavy metal guitar solos, the event is set to feature the wackiest of the continent's music scene as thousands of fans flock to the Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\nSweden became host after its homegrown star Loreen triumphed last year in Liverpool, England.\n\nBut this year's Contest - like in 2023, where Ukraine was forced to pass hosting privileges onto the U.K. - is one backdropped by war. However, the threat of mass boycott has not, to the outrage of some, convinced organizers to deviate from regular programming.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Eurovision 2024 ahead of its second semi-final and the Grand Final on the weekend.\n\nIsrael's participation this year has caused widespread controversy, and even some of Eurovision's most loyal fans have vowed to boycott the event. The war in Gaza, which has killed over 30,000 men, women, and children in the territory, has prompted outrage. The conflict escalated in October when Hamas militants launched an attack and murdered 1,200 people at an Israeli music festival. The retaliation from Israel has involved a near-constant barrage of airstrikes on Gaza since the Hamas incursion.\n\nBut Eurovision organizers are standing firm on Israel's inclusion in the event. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has also warned viewers not to direct abuse at the Israeli entrant this year, 20-year-old Eden Golan. \"We would like to stress that any decisions regarding participation are the responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies, not the individual artists,\" the EBU said. \"We are firmly against any form of abuse or harassment directed at participants, online or offline, and are committed to fostering a safe, respectful and inclusive environment.\"\n\nIt added that there should be a \"constructive dialogue and support\" for those competing, underlining the Contest's mission to be \"United By Music.\"\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog ordered \"necessary adjustments\" to Golan's initial entry to ensure his country could compete. The lyrics to \"October Rain\" seemingly referenced the Hamas attack. Golan will now perform a romantic ballad called \"Hurricane.\"\n\nBut other performers are already making a political stance. The EBU was forced to release a statement saying that they \"regret\" the opening act from former Swedish Eurovision contestant Eric Saade on Tuesday night. Saade, who is not competing in the Contest, had the keffiyeh symbol, commonly used by those in support of Palestine, on his arm as he performed his 2011 entry \"Popular.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the EBU said: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show. All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nSaade took to Instagram to question if freedom is \"controversial\" and why people keep asking if it is \"political.\"\n\nAhead of the shows, fans have been warned not to bring Palestinian flags, symbols, or bags as \"vigorous security checks\" will take place.\n\nEagle-eyed TV fans may recognize Olly Alexander from Channel 4's award-winning drama It's A Sin. But he was also the frontman of British pop band Years & Years before he began performing under his own name. He is an interesting choice as Britain's entrant this year -- a far bigger name than previous contestants were before their big Eurovision break, like Sam Ryder or Mae Muller, who are good examples of the not-quite-yet-established musicians the U.K. normally opts for.\n\nThe singer will be performing his dance track \"Dizzy,\" but has had to wade through myriad criticism to retain his spot in the final.\n\nMore than 450 queer artists, individuals and organizations called on him to not perform amid the conflict in Gaza.\n\nAlexander soon shared a statement on Twitter, formerly X, to say: \"I wholeheartedly support action being taken to demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the return of all hostages, and the safety and security of all civilians in Palestine and Israel.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is my current belief that removing myself from the contest wouldn't bring us any closer to our shared goal. Instead, I've been speaking with some of the other EV contestants and we've decided that by taking part we can use our platform to come together and call for peace.\"\n\nThe British star has separately added, in a glimpse of the BBC documentary Olly Alexander's Road to Eurovision '24, that the criticism has been \"extreme.\"\n\n\"I understand where that sentiment is coming from but I think it's not correct,\" he said. \"It's an incredibly complicated political situation, one that I'm not qualified to speak on. The backdrop to this is actual immense suffering. It's a humanitarian crisis, a war. It just so happens there's a song contest going on at the same time that I'm a part of.\"\n\nBy now, there is normally a clear star that the bookies are tipping to be the country to beat. But while there is some buzz around a few contestants, no one performance is standing out quite yet.\n\nCroatia's entrant, an act called Baby Lasagna, has garnered some attention in the run-up thanks to the song title \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim.\" The bleach-blond frontman has said the title does not translate as anything but is just a catchy riff, yet a serious theme about the economic migration of young Croatians lies beneath the performance.\n\nSwitzerland's act is also attracting some bets. \"The Code,\" by non-binary performer Nemo, tells the story of their gender identity. Italy's TikTok-famous contestant Angelina Mango could follow in the footsteps of M\u00e5neskin with her song \"La Noia.\"\n\nEurovision features an intricate voting system. The final leaderboard is determined by a combination of votes cast by viewers and a jury of music professionals in each participating country. Audiences at home can phone in to cast their vote and, notably, they cannot vote for their own country.\n\nIn a recent change, those watching in the rest of the world can now cast their vote via app or website in the days before the semi-finals and final. But, crucially, their collective vote holds the weight of only one additional country. Last year, Sweden's winner earned 583 points, ahead of Finland with 526 points. Israel placed third with 362 points.\n\nThe Eurovision audience is growing, and it's becoming a staple in the music calendar all over the globe.\n\nLast year, more than 160 million people watched the contest, according to the organizers. Iceland, Finland, Norway, and victor Sweden all had more than 80 percent of their TV-viewing populations tuned in. Media coverage of the event has grown 20 percent year-on-year, the EBU also said, with over 150,000 articles written about the Eurovision Song Contest in May 2023 alone.\n\nEven though only 37 countries took part last year, people from 144 different countries had their say and voted for the winner.\n\nIn the U.S., the Eurovision Song Contest will only be streaming on Peacock. Participating countries will be airing the event on their public broadcasting networks, such as the U.K.'s BBC.\n\nIn Sweden, the Eurovision Grand Final kicks off at 9 p.m. local time, which is 8 p.m. in London. L.A. viewers can watch at 12 p.m. on Saturday, and those in New York from 3 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors":

2024 crown", "body": "IT'S THAT time of year again when Eurovision fever is well and truly upon us.\n\nBut there can only be one winner, and there is already one country that is being tipped to scoop the crown.\n\nAccording to Ladbrokes betting shop, it will be Croatia's Baby Lasagna who will be named the champion of Eurovision with even-money odds.\n\nTheir track is called Rim Tim Tagi Dim and has already gone down a treat with fans online.\n\nAlex Apati of Ladbrokes said: \"Croatia already beginning to pull away as clear favourites to win in Sweden.\"\n\nFlying the flag for Switzerland is Nemo with their song The Code.\n\nThe singer is no stranger to a TV competition, finishing fifth in the second season of The Masked Singer Switzerland.\n\nIn their music, Nemo deals with personal themes such as gender identity, mental health and finding your place in this world.\n\nAs one of Eurovision's 'big five' Italy won an automatic place in the final.\n\nRepresenting them is rising star Angelina Mango with her song La Noia.\n\nHer music is a mix that brings together different influences, including Italian and American rap, R&B and instrumental music.\n\nUkraine is hoping for another win with aloyna aloyna & Jerry Heil's song, Teresa & Maria.\n\nThe country won Eurovision in 2022, but were unable to host the contest the following year due to the ongoing conflict.\n\nBut while the singer teamed up with Dua Lipa's producer for the track, it appears his efforts might not be enough to take the top spot.\n\nYears and Years frontman Olly is the UK's most high-profile Eurovision entry in more than a decade.\n\nHe's already secured a place in the final at Malmo Arena as one the show's 'five big countries'.\n\nSadly, the odds so far aren't in Olly's favour and the UK are 5/1 to finish last, and 12/1 to score 'nil-point'.\n\nAlex Apati of Ladbrokes said: \"It looks like it'll be yet another disappointing Eurovision year for the UK, with Olly Alexander now just 12/1 for a nil point night.\"\n\nThe winner will be announced in the Eurovision final on May 11, 2024.\n\nThe main rules that artists have to follow to be eligible to compete in Eurovision are:\n\nIn the grand finale, each country can vote for their favourite along with a jury of five industry professionals and the viewers.\n\nPoints are given on a scale of 1 -8, 10 or 12 points, but the jury cannot vote for their own country.\n\nViewers can vote through SMS, telephone or on the official Eurovision app.\n\nIf you weren't able to get a ticket to the live show in Sweden, never fear, there are plenty of other options to enjoy the show without leaving your house.\n\nThe BBC will be providing coverage of the contest across all three days.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Hopes were briefly raised in 2022 with Sam Ryder and he ended up finishing second. But the golden streak ended last year, when Mae Muller finished 25 out of 26.\n\nHowever, fans reckon things could be different this year, with Olly Alexander flying the flag for the UK.\n\nSo how many times exactly has the UK won? And which countries tend to do the best? We have a look at some Eurovision's facts and figures.\n\nThink of Eurovision successes, and two countries come to mind - Ireland and Sweden. Both have been hugely successful at the contest and they have racked up an impressive seven victories each. All eyes will be on both at the final, as each attempts to edge past the other and become most successful Eurovision country of all time.\n\nWhile the UK hasn't seen a win in a while, it has won five times before. This is on a par with Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands, making the UK one of the sixth most successful Eurovision countries.\n\nWhile the Eurovision performances serve up all the sequins, glitter and pop anyone could want, it's the scoring that has many viewers gripped. Who will get the most? Which countries will back each other? And will anyone get the dreaded \"nul points\" on the night?\n\nStatistics show that Sweden has racked up the most points over the years, a whopping 6471. But the UK isn't far behind, as its in third place behind Italy (4859), with 4571 points over the years. This means the UK ranks third out of the 52 nations for the highest total winning points in Eurovision history.\n\nThe UK romped to victory for the first time in 1967, with Sandie Shaw and her song Puppet On A String. Two years later Lulu clinched the trophy with Boom Bang-a-Bang, but there was then a lull until 1976 when Brotherhood Of Man triumphed with Save Your Kisses For Me.\n\nIn 1981, winners Bucks Fizz provided one of Eurovision's standout moments with their skirt-rip move during Making Your Mind Up, which has remained one of the most memorable moments of the contest for the UK.\n\nOur last ever winner was in 1997, when Katrina & The Waves won with Love Shine A Light.\n\nOf the UK winners, Shaw, Brotherhood Of Man and Bucks Fizz all had number ones with their Eurovision tracks. Lulu's had a number two and Love Shine A Light was number three.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest started in the 1950s and although it has been held 64 times, so far there have been 67 winners because one year saw a four-way tie.\n\nBut, interestingly, while more than 50 countries have participated in the competition over the years, the majority of the wins come from the same few.\n\nStatistics show that close to 50% of Eurovision victories come from the top few countries - Sweden, Ireland, the UK, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. They are responsible for 48% of wins.\n\nPercentages may not add up to 100%, as they are rounded to the nearest percent.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Muller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mae Muller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Ryder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Ryder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_at_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Man", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandie_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandie Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luxembourg"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Luxembourg"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Shine_a_Light", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Love Shine a Light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucks_Fizz", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bucks Fizz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_Bang-a-Bang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boom Bang-a-Bang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_Your_Kisses_for_Me", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Save Your Kisses for Me"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katrina_and_the_Waves", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katrina and the Waves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_Your_Mind_Up", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Making Your Mind Up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulu_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lulu (singer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2l4MlThfuu4PGnqjMJMzmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/40fc60b0-0caa-11ef-8bf7-114cc08c00c2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

All the Palestinians and the people in Israel\" - his participation or not in Eurovision \"isn't going to make a difference to those things, so that's why I'm still doing it\".\n\nOrganisers behind

Meanwhile, the rest of the performers from across Europe will be subject to a vote as they hope they can make their way through the semi-finals and into the illustrious grand final.\n\nWith roots tracing back to its inception in 1956, Eurovision has evolved into an iconic celebration of music and cultural diversity, captivating audiences worldwide.\n\nBut Eurovision is never far from controversy, with the inclusion of Israel being met with criticism due to its continued war in Gaza, leading to petitions calling for the country's removal. Event organisers will hope the boycott of the competition will not affect viewing figures.\n\nEurovision enthusiasts who are not boycotting the show can watch the grand final on 11 May, which will be broadcast live on BBC One at 8pm, and is accompanied by streaming options on BBC iPlayer, BBC Radio 2, and BBC Sounds.\n\nWho gets automatic qualification?\n\nThis year marks a significant shift as the Big Five, along with host nation Sweden, will grace the semi-final stage for the first time. In Tuesday's semi-final, the UK, Germany, and Sweden showcased their talents alongside other contestants - but will still receive automatic qualification like in previous years.\n\nThe concept of the Big Five originated in 2000 following a rule change that allowed countries to secure a direct spot in the grand final as they contributed the most money to the competition. Initially the UK, Spain, France, and Germany were the only nations who bought a ticket to the show, but the group expanded in 2011 with the inclusion of Italy.\n\nUK - Olly Alexander - 'Dizzy'\n\nThe 33-year-old performer is gearing up to grace the stage with his song \"Dizzy\".\n\nIn the semi-final, Olly is seen captivating the audience with his dynamic dance moves and soulful vocals within a striking setting -- a sprawling room adorned with weathered tiles and shower heads.\n\nBefore his selection for Eurovision, Olly had already left a mark on the global music scene as the frontman of the band Years & Years, boasting three successful albums, two of which soared to the coveted number one spot on the UK album chart.\n\nTypically (except for 2022), the UK hover near the bottom of the leaderboard in Eurovision - and according to the bookies, this year will be no different, where he is ranked as an 81/1 outsider.\n\nSweden - Marcus & Martinus - 'Unforgettable'\n\nSweden stands as one of the most triumphant nations in the Eurovision Song Contest, boasting a remarkable tally of seven victories.\n\nThe Swedish act for this year's Eurovision, Marcus & Martinus, who have previously expressed their aspiration to win over ABBA enthusiasts in the competition - as the event commemorates the 50th anniversary of the iconic pop group's triumph in the competition.\n\nThe set of twins debut their performance of \"Unforgettable\" during Tuesday's semi-final, after having already secured a spot in Saturday's final, courtesy of Sweden hosting this year's event after winning the 2023 competition in Liverpool.\n\nSpain - Nebulossa - 'Zorra'\n\nNebulossa is a Spanish electropop duo hailing from Ondara - a Spanish village near Benidorm.\n\nHowever, the selection of their song, \"Zorra\", has sparked controversy within Spanish society. \"Zorra,\" which translates to \"vixen\" in English, carries connotations akin to derogatory terms like \"bitch\", and the decision to feature a song with such loaded language has prompted intense debate.\n\nWhile some view \"Zorra\" as a bold anthem for Spain's feminist movement -- a reclaiming of a term historically used to demean women -- others are deeply troubled by its use in a national competition. The song's portrayal of female empowerment clashes with the discomfort surrounding its potentially offensive nature.\n\nBut in typical Eurovision style, their controversial song was chosen at the Benidorm Fest 2024, granting them the honour of representing Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024.\n\nFrance - Slimane - 'Mon Amour'\n\nFrance's Eurovision entry, \"\u00c9videmment\" by La Zarra, landed them in the 16th spot with 104 points way back in 2023. But this year, they are poised for a stronger showing with Slimane Nebchi - performing \"Mon Amour\" - who is one of the bookies' favourites to win Eurovision.\n\nFollowing his triumph on The Voice - France edition - in 2016, Slimane's sold two million albums and achieved two billion worldwide streams, and accumulated a staggering seven million social media followers.\n\nFrance T\u00e9l\u00e9visions handpicked Slimane internally to represent France at Eurovision 2024, with Silmane hoping to win over European audiences and secure France a top spot in the competition.\n\nGermany - Isaak Guderian - 'Always on The Run'\n\nGermany is showcasing \"Always on the Run\" by Isaak Guderian.\n\nGuderian, commonly known as Isaak, began his musical journey as a street musician, before he appeared on the TV talent show X Factor, delivering a memorable rendition of the Oasis hit \"Wonderwall\".\n\nAlthough he failed to impress and win the X Factor, he did not look back in anger, becoming a rock'n'roll star when he emerged victorious in Show Your Talent. He will now hope to impress Europe's Eurovision audience and become the first German winner of the competition since 2010.\n\nItaly - Angelina Mango - 'La Noia'\n\nWith an impressive track record boasting four platinum records, two gold records, and a sold-out tour, Angelina Mango emerged as one of Italy's standout stars of 2023.\n\nAt just 23 years old, she draws from a diverse range of influences including Italian and American rap, R&B, and instrumental music.\n\nMango's crowning achievement came with her victory at the prestigious Festival di Sanremo, which earns Italians the esteemed opportunity to represent Italy at Eurovision 2024 -- an opportunity she graciously accepted with her song \"La Noia\".\n\nNotably, Mango holds the distinction of being Italy's first female Eurovision representative since 2016 and the first female solo act to win Festival di Sanremo since 2014, symbolising an important milestone for female musicians in Italy.\n\nIolanda Costa, who hails from the coast town of Figueira da Foz, has made her mark on the Portuguese music scene, performing at the Festival da Can\u00e7\u00e3o with her entry \"Mar no fim\".\n\nThe recognition from her performance led to the release of her debut EP, Cura, in 2023, with the pinnacle of Costa's career climaxing in 2024 when she clinched victory at Festival da Can\u00e7\u00e3o with her emotive anthem \"Grito\" (Scream).\n\nGarnering unanimous acclaim from the juries and securing a commendable second place in the televote, Costa was selected to represent Portugal at Eurovision.\n\nSlovenia - Raiven - 'Veronika'\n\nRaiven burst onto the electro-pop scene in 2014, marking her debut in the vibrant musical landscape.\n\nHowever, it was her presence in Slovenia's esteemed national selection, EMA, that truly catapulted her into the spotlight of her country's music scene where she released \"\u010crno Bel, Za\u017earim\" and \"KAOS\".\n\nIn 2021, Raiven achieved a significant milestone by clinching victory at Slovenia's renowned music festival, Popevka, with her captivating song \"Volkovi\".\n\nUkraine - Alyona Alyona & Jerry Heil - 'Teresa & Maria'\n\nAlyona Alyona and Jerry Heil, the dynamic duo representing Ukraine in this year's Eurovision, made a bold pledge that has resonated deeply with the European audience: if they emerge victorious in the contest, they will sell the coveted trophy to aid in the reconstruction of bombed schools in Ukraine.\n\nHailed as \"Ukraine's most unlikely rap star\" in Vogue, Alyona has been lauded by Ukrainian media as \"the new rap star of Ukraine\" and \"the sensation of Ukrainian rap\".\n\nDrawing comparisons to the renowned Azealia Banks, Alyona Alyona has teamed up with Yana Oleksandrivna Shemaieva - otherwise known by her stage name Jerry Heil.\n\nBorn on 21 October, 1995, in Vasylkiv, a city adjacent to Kyiv, Heil launched a YouTube channel in 2012, sharing vlogs and musical covers. With over 34.9 million views and 395,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel, she will be hoping her global reach will help reach Eurovision voters and gain another victory for Ukraine.\n\nFinland - Windows95man - 'No Rules!'\n\nTeemu Keisteri - also known by his captivating stage persona Windows95man - is a Finnish visual artist and DJ.\n\nAs a DJ, Teemu's electrifying sets transport audiences back to the golden era of Eurodance and 90s techno,\n\nTeemu's latest triumph came with his participation in UMK 2024, Finland's national selection for Eurovision, where he teamed up with singer Henri Piispanen to deliver the electrifying anthem \"No Rules!\".\n\nAs Finland's representative in Eurovision, Teemu and Henri are poised to showcase their unique blend of techno and vocals to captivate Eurovision's audiences worldwide, in what will be an unforgettable entry.\n\nCyprus - Silia Kapsis - 'Liar'\n\nVasiliki Silia Kapsis, originally from Australia, is a Cypriot singer who unveiled her debut song, \"Who Am I?\", in 2022 - a poignant composition that she both wrote and composed at the age of 12.\n\nNow, Vasiliki embarks on a new chapter in her career as she represents Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nWith her captivating presence and emotive performance, she is set to enchant audiences with her song \"Liar\".\n\nCroatia - Baby Lasagna - 'Rim Tim Tagi Dim'\n\nThe bookies' favourite at 2/1, Baby Lasagna - also known by Puri\u0161i\u0107 - is Croatia's selection for the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nHis initial success in Croatia came from an impressive debut at number 24 on the HR Top 40 chart, marking Puri\u0161i\u0107's first chart entry in Croatia.\n\nFollowing this success, he released his Eurovision entry \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\". Which soared to number one on the charts and captured the hearts of audiences nationwide.\n\nIreland - Bambie Thug - 'Doomsday Blue'\n\nHailing from Cork in Ireland, Bambie Thug is reshaping the musical landscape by blending the realms of pop, rock, electronic music and horror film, to create the unique sound she calls \"Ouija-pop\".\n\nHistorically, Eurovision thrives with performances by those who indulge in the weird and wonderful -- and Bambie Thug's song is certainly weird - so the bookies have ranked her as an outside favourite.\n\nThis is Ireland's first time back at the Eurovision finals after a series of acts failed to grab the attention of audiences, so Bambie Thug will be aiming to secure Ireland's first win since 1996.\n\nLuxembourg - TALI - 'Fighter'\n\nTali Golergant - known simply as Tali - is an artist born in Israel and now based in Luxembourg.\n\nIn December 2023, Tali emerged as one of the eight finalists in the prestigious Luxembourg Song Contest.\n\nTali's musical style is a fusion of pop, indie, and R&B, showcasing her diverse influences which include the likes of Lizzy McAlpine, Sara Bareilles, and Lady Gaga, and will represent Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 with her song anthem \"Fighter\".\n\nWhen is the second semi-final?\n\nOn Thursday 9 May, viewers can tune in to the second Eurovision semi-final, which will be broadcast live on the BBC starting at 8pm.

During Eurovision week last year, we made daily episodes which saw our episode listenership more than double.\"\n\nSince graduating in 2022, James now works as a freelance audio producer for BBC Sport, Radio Newcastle and Hits Radio North East, but he is still committed to working alongside his brother on their Eurovision podcast.\n\nHe said: \"The Euro Trip is the world's leading independent Eurovision podcast.\n\n\"The podcast was something I started doing alongside my studies, using the skills I was learning on my course and applying them to the real world.\n\n\"The podcast is something I am hugely proud of and it stands front and centre on my CV.\n\n\"Callum and I have become a trusted name within the Eurovision media space, often appearing on outlets such as BBC News as experts on the contest.\"\n\nBoth brothers credit working on the University's student radio station, Spark, as the place they were able to hone their broadcasting skills.\n\nAlistair Robinson, Senior Lecturer in Journalism and Public Relations at the University of Sunderland, backed the brothers' funding application.\n\nHe said: \"I'm delighted we've been able to help Callum and James with this opportunity. They are Eurovision experts and have developed an extraordinary specialism in Eurovision reporting.\n\n\"I've taught Callum for three years now and he has produced consistently excellent work, on a range of subjects, not just pop music or Eurovision. Since graduating, James has further honed his skills in the industry.\n\n\"They make a formidable team.\"\n\nThis year's Eurovision Song Contest takes place in Malm\u00f6 in Sweden on Saturday May 11.", "source": {"uri": "sunderlandecho.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sunderland Echo - Sunderland Local news, sport and entertainment covering Wearside - www.sunderlandecho.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_fatkin@sunderlandecho.com", "name": "Neil Fatkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sunderland", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Sunderland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Callum Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeview_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freeview (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_broadcasting", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International broadcasting"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_Newcastle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio Newcastle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campus radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freelancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Internet", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Industry", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Industry", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.sunderlandecho.com/jpim-static/image/2024/05/08/12/43/e5e88850-828e-41c2-b58e-fed8081bde41.jpg.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 167, "textEnd": 173, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Eurovision Song Contest is back for another year and, once again, an Australian act will be taking to the stage.\n\nIt may seem a bit weird Australia is a competitor in a contest that starts with \"Euro\" given we're so far away from the continent.\n\nBut we've been competing for years now.\n\nIn short, because Australian broadcaster SBS has been such a big supporter of the event.\n\nIt's been covering the contest since 1983 - a whopping four decades - but Australian acts have only been taking the stage for 10 years.\n\nIt kicked off in 2014, when iconic Australian singer Jessica Mauboy was invited to be a guest singer during the interval.\n\nThe following year, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) invited Australia to compete as a wildcard entry.\n\nThis was back during the contest's 60th birthday and was all about \"building bridges\".\n\nThat year, we sent Guy Sebastian to compete and he came in fifth place.\n\nAfter this success, the SBS struck a deal with the EBU for Australia to stay on the bill until 2023.\n\nThere was a question mark about Australia's future in the contest after Eurovision 2023, but in early December it was confirmed that Australia would take part this year.\n\nBut Australia isn't the only non-European country in the contest, with nations like Ukraine and Armenia also competing.\n\nThis year, there are 37 Eurovision Song Contest participating countries:\n\nIsrael agreed to modify the lyrics of its original song, which was called October Rain and is now titled Hurricane.\n\nThe EBU said the original lyrics referenced the Hamas attacks on an Israeli music festival on October 7, which triggered Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThis year, Israel will be represented by Eden Golan, who did not write the song.\n\nShe was selected to be Israel's contestant after winning a televised singing contest.\n\nGolan didn't attend the opening ceremony on Sunday due to Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, Swedish broadcaster SVT said.\n\nBut she spoke to Reuters in an interview on Monday.\n\n\"I come here to show my voice, to share my love, my gift from God and to hopefully make people feel something and leave a mark in their souls and to unite by music,\" she said.\n\nBecause its broadcaster is a member of the EBU, so it has a place in the competition like Australia.\n\nExcept while Australia is only relatively new to the competition, Israel has been competing in Eurovision for more than 50 years.\n\n\"Israel made its debut in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1973 as the first non-European country granted permission to participate in the event,\" the Eurovision website says.\n\n\"The EBU allowed Israel to participate since the country's broadcaster was already one of its members.\"\n\nAs this year's contest approaches, there are growing calls from some critics to ban Israel from the competition, in the same way Russia was banned in 2022.\n\nThe EBU told international news syndicate Agence France-Presse it decided late last year that Israel could participate.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU,\" the union's director-general, Noel Curran, said.\n\n\"It is not a contest between governments.\"\n\nMr Curran said in the case of Russia, it was the Russian broadcasters themselves who were suspended from the EBU \"due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values\".\n\nHowever, this hasn't stopped the calls for Israel to be banned, with protests expected at the event.\n\nGolan was asked how she felt about the possibility of demonstrations.\n\n\"It's up to the people what to do,\" she said.\n\n\"They have the right to speak their voice, but I'm focusing on my part, which is giving the best performance, and on the good, on the good vibes, the good people.\"\n\nMalm\u00f6 is bracing for possible unrest during the week, although police have said there have been no concrete threats against the event.\n\nThe first semifinal will be held in Sweden on Tuesday night but, because of the time difference, it'll be Wednesday morning in Australia.\n\nSo you can watch it on free-to-air television or SBS On Demand.\n\nWe'll also be live blogging the finals, so if you're planning an early-morning viewing party, we'll be on hand to keep you company.",

(Eurovision/European Broadcasting Union/Peppe Andersson)\n\nOlly Alexander is gearing up for one of the biggest weeks of his career to date as the UK's 2024 Eurovision Song Contest entrant - and he plans to make it \"as gay as possible\".\n\nOn Tuesday night (7 May) Alexander will take his song, the Danny L Harle produced pop bop \"Dizzy\", to the Eurovision stage in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, for the first time during the first semi-final.\n\nFans have already had a taste of what's to come thanks to footage from the rehearsals, and his staging looks, for want of a better term, gay as hell. And that's exactly what he hoped for.\n\nSpeaking to PinkNews and other media, Alexander describes why he wanted the staging he has - which includes him performing in a filthy post-apocalyptic locker room, surrounded by shirtless men in skimpy boxing shorts.\n\n\"I think if you're going to take a song to Eurovision, the last thing you should do is be safe. As an artist, I love to provoke a little bit, just cause a little bit of discussion, intrigue,\" he shares.\n\nOlly Alexander has form for upsetting miserable prudes watching the BBC: back in 2021, almost 200 people complained that he was being \"too sexual\" during his performance with Kylie Minogue and The Pet Shop Boys during the BBC's Big New Years & Years Eve Party.\n\nAs he said back then, and he maintains now, he will never stop incorporating queerness into his performances.\n\n\"I said right in the beginning of this process, I plan to be as gay as possible - and what's gayer than a locker room?,\" he laughs.\n\n\"I just want mainly to entertain people and to give a really fab performance. Of course, not everyone's gonna love it. But I think that's a sign of a strong performance, really.\"\n\nAnyway, this isn't Alexander's most daring performance look to-date, not by a long shot: he's wearing a tatty white singlet, red trousers, and boots.\n\n\"It's not my most outlandish outfit I've ever worn, but it's more in keeping with the story and the narrative, this sort of post-apocalyptic locker room,\" he explains.\n\n\"It's distressed, maybe I've been through a fight and I fought my way to the Eurovision stage, ready to slay with my boxing gym boys.\"\n\nEurovision 2024 is already set to be one of the queerest in the contest's history: alongside Alexander, there are two other non-binary artists in Ireland's Bambie Thug and Switzerland's (front-runner) Nemo. Other acts including Drag Race Belgium judge Mustii, Australia's Electric Fields, Lithuania's Silvester Belt, and Denmark's SABA also identify as LGBTQ+.\n\nBeing surrounded by queer energy has been imperative for Alexander throughout the process.\n\n\"Historically, Eurovision has been a great place for queer performers, obviously for queer audiences,\" he says.\n\n\"This year, I've really made friends with a lot of contestants, but I've definitely connected a lot with Bambi, with Nemo, with Silvester. Just having that community with each other has been really important. We've been able to support each other a lot.\"\n\nDespite Eurovision being dubbed the gay Olympics, Alexander knows that queer artists still face judgment from viewers outside of the LGBTQ+ community, while some of the countries participating are far more intolerant of LGBTQ+ people than others.\n\n\"We know that, obviously, all of us as contestants when we're in the spotlight, we're going to get judged harshly. For the queer performers, we're going to get a lot of backlash and hate just for being queer and just for being kind of out there visible,\" Alexander reflects.\n\nHe and his fellow queer performers won't be cowed by what any viewers have to say about them, though.\n\n\"There's a lot of value in being your authentic self, being out on a stage and being proud of who you are... we've all had some really good discussions about what it's taken for us to come here to perform at Eurovision. Having each other, it's been really good.\"\n\nWhile taking part in Eurovision is what counts, the question of winning isn't off the table yet either, despite what some betting odds are saying.\n\nAlexander urges fans not to \"count [him] out yet\" but ultimately, but he isn't feeling the pressure about bringing the Eurovision crown back home to the UK.\n\n\"I'm just not going to focus on where I place in the final because as long as I just do a performance I'm proud of, do my best, then that's all that matters,\" he says.\n\n\"Of course I'd love to have a good result, but you just never know what's going to happen on the night. So many things are out of your control... so, whatever will be will be, and I've made my peace with that.\"\n\nOlly Alexander will perform at the first Eurovision semi-final on 7 May, and then again at the Eurovision final on 11 May.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nHe also noted the EBU, an apolitical member organisation, is \"in line\" with other international federations including sports bodies who are allowing Israel to participate in events.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nIn March, Alexander along with Irish hopeful Bambie Thug and other Eurovision artists released a joint statement, backing \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire\" but refusing to boycott the event.\n\nThat same month, Israel unveiled its new entry song as Hurricane, performed by singer Eden Golan.\n\nHer original track, October Rain, had caused controversy as the lyrics were thought to reference the Hamas attacks of October 7 before being changed following the backlash.\n\nDiscussing the backlash, De Tender said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan, which is the Israeli public broadcaster, met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\nIn 2022, EBU announced that Russia would no longer be participating in Eurovision following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA statement at the time said the EBU's executive board had made the decision following a recommendation by the Eurovision governing body, known as the reference group, based on \"the rules of the event and the values of the EBU\".\n\nOn Sunday, De Tender said the situation between Russia and Israel was \"different\" as in Russia's case there was a \"broad consensus within the membership of the EBU that they could not participate\".\n\nHe added that the three Russian members of the EBU had already been \"excluded\" from the EBU membership in the weeks after the war broke out due to breaching \"member obligations\".\n\nThe 37 Eurovision entries are set to perform across two semi-finals next week on Tuesday and Thursday in a bid to compete for a place in the grand final on Saturday.\n\nAlexander is set to perform his dance-infused track Dizzy on behalf of the UK during the Tuesday semi-final, but he is already through to the final along with the other members of the \"big five\" - France, Germany, Italy and Spain - as well as last year's winner Sweden, who get to go through automatically.\n\nDe Tender said the preparations are going \"very well\" as they have been planning the music spectacle in Sweden for the past year after Loreen won the competition with her hit song Tattoo.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest",

This year, the United Kingdom is represented by Years & Years singer and It's A Sin star Olly Alexander and his pop hit 'Dizzy'.\n\nIn case you weren't aware, Eurovision is a week-long affair, with two semi-finals turning 37 competing countries into the 26 who will take part in the Grand Final on the Saturday night.\n\nBut the UK never has to worry about this. Alongside Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, they are part of the 'Big Five': the highest-paying members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). As a result, these countries always automatically qualify for the final, alongside last year's winning country. After all, surely it's only fair that the host nation gets to participate in their own contest?\n\nTherefore, the UK is always in the mix when it comes to the big final, regardless of where on the board they end up on the night.\n\nBut while the semi-finals aren't a concern in this country, they have become more of a spectacle after the UK hosted the contest on behalf of Ukraine last year. This increased interest in the build-up to Saturday's final means that this year, both semi-finals are staying on BBC One, after airing on BBC Three or Four in years gone by.\n\nAnd there is even more incentive for UK viewers to get involved this year, as in a change to the contest, the six automatic qualifiers will be performing live during the semi-finals for the very first time.\n\nThis change was announced back in March by the Swedish broadcaster SVT, and Ebba Adielsson, executive producer of this year's contest, said: \"We think that this change gives the Big Five countries and the host country a fairer playing field in the Grand Final, as they now have the opportunity to perform 'for real' on stage in the semi-finals.\n\n\"It is also a win for both the audience in the arena and the viewers at home, in that they get to see all the acts competing this year live before the Grand Final.\"\n\nEurovision's executive supervisor, Martin \u00d6sterdahl, added: \"Finally we get to see Europe's largest countries and the hosts perform their songs in full in the semi-finals, meaning there's even more entertainment for fans and viewers and, like all the qualifiers, the Big Five and host country now get to perform their songs live twice on the Eurovision stage.\"\n\nSo while the UK thankfully still has that guaranteed spot in the final, Olly will be slotted into the running order in tonight's first semi-final (May 7) along with Germany's Isaak and host Sweden's Marcus and Martinus.\n\nThen during the second semi-final on Thursday, May 9, Spain's Nebulossa, Italy's Angelina Mango and France's Slimane will all perform live, alongside a line-up of acts who are hoping to join them in the big final.\n\nFittingly, in tonight's first semi-final, the UK will perform just after neighbours Ireland, who, despite a record seven Eurovision wins, are aiming for their first qualification since 2018.\n\nNon-binary artist Bambie Thug is bringing their own brand of 'ouija pop' to the Eurovision stage with their song 'Doomsday Blue' and with a lot of hype building around their show-stopping performance, it looks likely that Ireland's unlucky streak will be broken this evening.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK delegation has arrived in Malm\u00f6 with some incredibly innovative and ambitious staging that is sure to stand out in the final. While an exciting snippet has been released online in the last few days, tonight's semi-final will be the first chance to see Olly's performance in full and is not to be missed.\n\nSo even if you have never watched a Eurovision semi-final before, why not start the fun before Saturday?", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_a_Sin_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "It's a Sin (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_&_Years", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Years & Years"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Three", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Three"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_Television", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sveriges Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_\u00d6sterdahl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin \u00d6sterdahl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_&_Martinus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus & Martinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Island Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vmHrn1p5qnzxsNIj5chPbA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MDU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/digital_spy_281/bdde976dcb3c45364ba041caa9866bef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2553, "textEnd": 2558}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2674, "textEnd": 2679}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Who needs Vitamin D when you're both giving us all the feel good we need. Thank you beautiful people.\"\n\nScott Mills, who is a Eurovision superfan and who came out as gay in 2001, has devoted a lot of airtime on his show to Eurovision lately, which is unsurprising giving his semi-final commenting duties - and the fact he'll be presenting his show live from Malm\u00f6.\n\nToday (8 May), he will be interviewing Olly Alexander about how his first live performance of UK Eurovision entry \"Dizzy\" went, you can listen on the BBC Sounds app.\n\nIn fact, Scott Mills is such a huge fan of Eurovision that he's even planning to include \"nods\" to the iconic song contest in his upcoming wedding to fianc\u00e9 Sam Vaughan this summer: they announced their engagement on Instagram in 2021.\n\nOK Magazine reports that the 51-year-old is \"feeling the pressure\" ahead of his nuptials this year.\n\n\"Planning is going really well, it's really near now,\" he explained. \"It's a summer wedding. I think we're worked out all the logistics of everything and what's going to happen on the day.\"\n\nHowever, he said he's running a bit behind with one key task: \"What I haven't written yet, which I think I should tackle quite soon and I'll probably do it the week after Eurovision, is my speech,\" he added.\n\nWhen he was asked if guests can expect a Eurovision theme for his big day, Scott admitted that there will be \"nods\" to the iconic singing contest.\n\n\"I'm actually taking my fianc\u00e9 to Eurovision this year,\" he continued. 'When we met, he kind of knew what I did but he didn't know that I worked on Eurovision and he was like, 'No, I don't like Eurovision, it's not really for me, I don't get it.'\n\n\"That was fine. Then I said to him one year - the first year that me and Rylan started working together - I said, 'Just come for two days and see if you like it.' He came for two days, absolutely loved it and has been there ever since for the whole week!\n\n\"He's gone from disliking Eurovision to loving it so much that there are not one but two nods to Eurovision at our wedding.\"\n\nAlthough Scott kept quite tight-lipped about the fine details, he did admit that one of the songs that his wedding guests will be arriving to is a former Eurovision winning song.\n\n\"It's not that hard to work out. When I told the people who are going to be performing it, I thought they'd be like, 'What's that?' They were like 'Oh, everyone knows that song, of course we'll do it' So they're going to do a slow, acoustic version of this winning song.\"\n\nScott Mills fianc\u00e9 Sam Vaughan is a freelance audio producer and company director. His LinkedIn lists him as the \"producer of Series 3 and 4 of Scott Mills and Steve Mann's Pupdates Podcast\".\n\nHe also runs Influx Live, which is a live talent agency and audio production company.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilary_mitchell@thepinknews.com", "name": "Hilary Mitchell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double entendre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Didgeridoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sounds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sounds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fan (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acoustic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freelancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.thepinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1402716648.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 159, "textEnd": 164, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 205, "textEnd": 210}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1231, "textEnd": 1236}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest is taking place tonight (Tuesday 7 May), with Ireland's contestant Bambie Thug up against Ukraine's duo Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil.\n\nFifteen semi-finalists will perform at the Malm\u00f6 Arena in Sweden, all of whom are hoping to make it through to the grand final on Saturday 11 May.\n\nThe UK's entry, pop singer Olly Alexander, will be performing his song \"Dizzy\". However, he has already made the final, as the UK is one of the \"big five\" countries guaranteed a place thanks to their status as one of the largest contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organisers behind Eurovision.\n\nCork-born, London-based singer Bambie Thug is hoping to make it through with their electro-metal song \"Doomsday Blue\", along with Sweden's delegates, the Norway-born twin singers Marcus & Martinus, who will sing their club bop \"Unforgettable\". Sweden is also an automatic finalist thanks to their 2023 win.\n\nAlyona and Heil, who are set to perform fifth on 7 May, are considered strong competition with their moving anthem \"Teresa & Maria\". Ukraine last won in 2022 with Kalush Orchestra, and before that in 2016 with Jamala.\n\nElsewhere, current favourite Baby Lasagna will perform the outlandish \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\", and Finnish entrant Windows95Man with \"No Rules!\".\n\nOther countries competing in the first semi-final include Cyprus, Serbie, Lithuania, Poland, Iceland, Slovenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Australia, Portugal and Luxembourg.\n\nAnother 16 countries will compete in the second semi-final on Thursday 9 May: Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czechia, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway and the Netherlands.\n\nSwitzerland's delegate Nemo is another strong favourite with their operatic banger \"The Code\".\n\nFans hoping for cheery pop tunes might be surprised to learn that the majority of songs this year will be performed in the minor key. Just two out of the 37 entrants are in a major key, the lowest since the contest began in 1956, according to analysis by the PA news agency.\n\nIf Iceland's Hera Bjork and Poland's Luna fail to make it through to the grand final, it would be the first in Eurovision history where no songs are performed in a major key.\n\nProtests are expected to take place during the second semi-final due to Israel's participation, amid its war on Gaza.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 grand final will take place on Saturday 11 May, with the running order to be determined once the finalists have been announced.\n\nHosting duties will be performed live from the Malm\u00f6 Arena by Swedish-American actor Malin \u00c5kerman and Eurovision veteran Petra Mede.\n\nAlso at the grand final, fans will get to watch a special performance from reigning Eurovision champion Loreen.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This year, the UK is represented by Years & Years singer and Its A Sin star Olly Alexander and his pop hit Dizzy.\n\nIn case you didn't know, Eurovision lasts for a week. 37 countries will compete across two semi-finals, making up the 26 that will compete in the grand final on Saturday night.\n\nBut Britain need not worry about this at all. Along with Germany, France, Italy and Spain, it is one of the Big Five highest-paid members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). As a result, these countries always automatically qualify for the finals, along with last year's winning country. After all, is it only fair for the host country to participate in its own competition?\n\nOllie Scarf//Getty Images\n\nSo England will always be in disarray, no matter where they end up on final night.\n\nBut while the semi-finals are not a big deal in this country, they have become more of a spectacle since England hosted the competition on behalf of Ukraine last year. Due to growing interest in Saturday's final, both semi-finals this year will remain on BBC One after being broadcast on BBC Three or Four.\n\nAnd changes to the contest mean there's even more incentive to engage UK viewers this year, with six automatic qualifiers performing live in the semi-finals for the first time.\n\nThe change was announced by Swedish broadcaster SVT in March and Ebba Adielsson, executive producer of this year's contest, said: Because now you have a chance to actually perform on the semi-final stage.\n\nMatt Healy//BBC\n\n\"It's also a win for both stadium audiences and home viewers as they will be able to see all of this year's competing acts live before the grand final.\"\n\nMartin sterdahl, Chief Inspector of Eurovisions, added: \"Finally, we got to see Europe's biggest countries and hosts perform their songs to perfection in the semi-finals. The Five and hosts will now perform their songs live on the Eurovision stage twice.\"\n\nSo while Britain are fortunately guaranteed a place in the final, Olly will be in the line-up for tonight's first semi-final (7 May) alongside Germany's Isaak and hosts Sweden's Marcus and Martinus.\n\nThen, the second semi-final on Thursday 9 May will see Spain's Nebulossa, Italy's Angelina Mango and Frances Slimane all perform live, along with performers hoping to join them in the final.\n\ngetty images\n\nFittingly, in tonight's first semi-final, Britain will play just behind neighbors Ireland, who are aiming for their first qualification since 2018 despite having won seven Eurovision games.\n\nNon-binary artist Bambie Thug is bringing his own brand of Ouija pop to the Eurovision stage with his song Doomsday Blue, and with so much hype surrounding their incredible performance, it looks like Ireland's run of bad luck will be broken this evening. .\n\nMeanwhile, the British delegation arrived in Malm with an innovative and ambitious performance that stood out for the final. There's been some interesting stuff revealed online over the past few days, but tonight's semi-final will be your first chance to see Ollys play in full, so you can't miss it.\n\nSo even if you've never seen the Eurovision semi-finals before, why not get in on the action before Saturday?\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest semi-finals will be broadcast on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 8pm on Tuesday 7 May and Thursday 9 May, with the final airing on Saturday 11 May.\n\nAfter graduating with an English degree from the University of Exeter, Erin completed a PPA accredited Masters in Magazine Journalism from Cardiff University.

Sweden is also an automatic finalist thanks to their 2023 win.\n\nAlyona and Heil are considered strong competition with their moving anthem \"Teresa & Maria\". Ukraine last won in 2022 with Kalush Orchestra, and before that in 2016 with Jamala.\n\nElsewhere, current favourite Baby Lasagna will now perform his outlandish \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" at the grand final, as will Finnish entrant Windows95Man with \"No Rules!\".\n\nThe UK's entry, pop singer Olly Alexander, also performed his song \"Dizzy\". However, he has already made the final, as the UK is one of the \"big five\" countries guaranteed a place thanks to their status as one of the largest contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organisers behind Eurovision.\n\nAnother 16 countries will compete in the second semi-final on Thursday 9 May: Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czechia, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway and the Netherlands.\n\nSwitzerland's delegate Nemo is another strong favourite with their operatic banger \"The Code\".\n\nFans hoping for cheery pop tunes might be surprised to learn that the majority of songs this year will be performed in the minor key. Just two out of the 37 entrants are in a major key, the lowest since the contest began in 1956, according to analysis by the PA news agency.\n\nIf Iceland's Hera Bjork and Poland's Luna fail to make it through to the grand final, it would be the first in Eurovision history where no songs are performed in a major key.\n\nProtests are expected to take place during the second semi-final due to Israel's participation, amid its war on Gaza.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 grand final will take place on Saturday 11 May, with the running order to be determined once the finalists have been announced.\n\nHosting duties will be performed live from the Malm\u00f6 Arena by Swedish-American actor Malin \u00c5kerman and Eurovision veteran Petra Mede.\n\nAlso at the grand final, fans will get

The city also hosted Eurovision in 1992 and in 2013.\n\nSweden has hosted Eurovision seven times in total, counting 2024. Stockholm, the capital, hosted the competition in 1975, 2000 and 2016 and Gothenburg in 1985.\n\nThe concert venue is the Malmo Arena which has a capacity of up to 15,500.\n\nWHAT DEMONSTRATIONS ARE EXPECTED?\n\nSeveral protests are planned in central Malmo this week after organizer European Broadcasting Union (EBU) resisted calls to exclude Israel over its devastating military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nProtests against Israel's participation which are expected to draw tens of thousands of people are scheduled for 1300 GMT on Thursday and Saturday. Pro-Israel supporters have planned a protest for Thursday at 1600 GMT.\n\nI absolutely also think that... that is what I would do, that I would give my life for the Pope, because that is a big part of why I'm here.\n\nA vessel from Swedish NGO 'Ship to Gaza' is scheduled to arrive in Malmo harbour on Wednesday, with a call for solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nWHAT SECURITY MEASURES ARE TAKEN?\n\nSwedish police said security will be higher than in 2013 when Malmo last hosted the Eurovision. It has been reinforced by officers from neighbouring Denmark and Norway.\n\nAuthorities have said the threat level for terrorist or cyber attacks is high.\n\nVisitors will have to pass through metal detectors before entering Malmo arena and will not be allowed to bring bags into the venue.\n\nOnly the national flags of the participating countries and the Pride flag are allowed inside the venue, while flags, symbols, clothing, items and banners likely to be to used promote other causes during the TV broadcast will be removed.\n\nHOW DOES VOTING WORK?\n\nViewers decide the results of the two semi-finals and can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or via a Eurovision app.\n\nViewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 were eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nViewers in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 are eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain.\n\nIn the final, audience votes will make up half of the result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country will make up the other half.\n\nThe juries will rank the songs based on composition and originality of the song, quality of the stage performance, the artists' vocal capacity, and their overall impression of the act.\n\nEach country will award points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12.\n\nNon-participating countries around the world will also be able to vote, and will collectively have the weight of one additional voting country.\n\nNew to this year's Eurovision, viewers outside the participating countries can vote 24 hours prior each semi-final and the Grand final.\n\nWHO SECURED A SPOT IN THE GRAND FINAL FOLLOWING THE FIRST SEMI-FINAL?\n\nCroatia, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Ukraine.\n\nAustralia, Azerbaijan, Iceland, Moldova, and Poland did not make it through to the final.\n\nWHO WILL COMPETE IN THE SECOND SEMI-FINAL ON THURSDAY?\n\nMalta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands.\n\nWHO COMPETES IN THE GRAND FINAL?\n\nThe top 10 from each semi-final will participate in the final.\n\nLast year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe \"Big Five\" countries are France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which make the biggest financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\nSince 2000, these countries have secured themselves an automatic spot in the Grand Final.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The results included some big moments -- Eurovision seeing its first ever nonbinary artist to qualify, and Luxembourg back in the Grand Final after a break of three decades.\n\nThe night started with 15 competing acts, before 10 qualifiers were chosen through a public vote. The countries heading to Saturday's Grand Final are Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland, Cyprus, Croatia, Ireland and Luxembourg.\n\nThe first artist to be quizzed by the press was Silia Kapsis from Cyprus. She said:\n\n\"It's a huge opportunity for me, especially because I'm 17. I'm representing my country and my culture.\"\n\nAs an Australian, she was asked about how she feels that Australia did not qualify this year. She described Electric Fields as talented people who show culture. She hopes she'll make Australia proud too.\n\nSerbia's TEYA DORA told the audience about an earlier rehearsal, where Serbia was the first country read out as a qualifier -- she thought how amazing it would be if that happened in the real show. And it did. She said:\n\n\"It's such a big opportunity, there's so many people watching... The next step is to give the best that we can give and get the best placement we can have. I'm happy there are so many people who will hear my music.\"\n\nSilvester Belt from Lithuania said that his biggest challenge at Eurovision has been sleeping. When asked his thoughts about whether sending a song in Lithuanian would hinder his chances, he said:\n\n\"Initially, I was the same as most Lithuanians, who were like, 'You have to send English songs...' but the rest of the world kept saying Lithuanian is a beautiful language.\"\n\nUkraine's alyona alyona & Jerry Heil were another act asked about language. alyona said that it was \"super cool\" to have so many countries singing in their own languages. Jerry added that if Ukrainian music, whether from Eurovision or not, ends up in people's playlists, then they'll feel they've won. The pair were asked if they felt a lot of pressure to qualify after Ukraine has experienced so much success at Eurovision. Jerry said:\n\n\"We feel like Ukraine expects from us that we're going to do great. But we have a great team... and I guess we did it today.\"\n\nBambie Thug from Ireland also qualified for the Grand Final with their song Doomsday Blue. When asked how they were feeling, they said:\n\n\"I have completely dissociated right now, I'm having an out of body experience! I'm super proud, our team is very small and I'm an independent artist. It's incredible that we reached here. I'm the first nonbinary artist to qualify. See you Saturday.\"\n\nThey were asked about what makes them special. To which they stood up, opened up their arms and said:\n\n\"What makes me special? You know what makes me special? I'm queer. I love art. I love drama. I love theatre. I'm gonna give you a show.\"\n\nFor Baby Lasagna from Croatia, getting up on stage is usually about being in the moment. But performing live on television still required a certain amount of concentration. He explained how he navigates it all:\n\n\"Eurovision is on a next level when it comes to professionalism... you have to look at this camera, then that... I can't just let myself be in the moment, I have to think.\"\n\nSlovenia's Raiven said she's been doubting herself the whole time, and qualifying was a huge surprise. She was asked about where the ideas from the staging for Veronika came from, and said:\n\n\"When it comes to making the music and visuals I always just go with my instinct. I had this idea that I wanted to be completely naked and silver. The staging is truly me, how I am, and I think the song is dramatic enough that I don't need to add anything more.\"\n\nWhen Finland's Windows95man was asked whether he thinks he'll get 12 points from various countries, he replied: \"Maybe...\" He also explained that his song is an art project which has escalated, so qualifying for the Grand Final is a huge surprise for him.\n\nHe confirmed which one rule he would change at Eurovision if he could:\n\n\"More nakedness. For everybody.\"\n\nFollowing on from Windows95man's discussion about the rules, Portugal's iolanda said she doesn't believe in any rules when it comes to music. She talked about why she kept her own staging simple and added:\n\n\"You can do a lot with not much money and that for me is better than fireworks.\"\n\nEchoing Lithuania and Ukraine, she said that she doesn't believe any language is a barrier.\n\nTALI from Luxembourg was the final artist to be announced as a qualifier. She said that when the camera approached her, she started to believe a place in the Grand Final was possible. She was asked about Luxembourg taking such a long break from the Contest, and whether she thinks her qualifying will inspire other countries to return. She replied:\n\n\"This is a beautiful contest that unites, so I definitely hope it inspires other countries to come back, or join for the first time.\"\n\nThe qualifying acts also found out which half of the Grand Final they will perform in, or whether they had landed a Producer's Choice option - which means that host broadcaster SVT can decide their position in the running order.\n\nYou can watch the full press conference of the qualifiers of the First Semi-Final right here:\n\nYou can listen to all 37 songs of Eurovision 2024 via your favourite streaming service or watch the music videos on our YouTube channel.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest will take place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden on Tuesday 7 May (First Semi-Final), Thursday 9 May (Second Semi-Final) and Saturday 11 May (Grand Final)

The band motto is \"bypass the barriers\", and Fielding and Ross describe themselves as \"two feminine brothers\".\n\nSpanish rock band Megara is performing the song \"11:11\" at Eurovision for San Marino, with the song fusing elements of rock, metal, dance, and electronica.\n\nThe band previously said they don't want to be \"pigeonholed\" into any one genre of music.\n\nMegara is made up of four members, and the band's lead vocalist Kenzy Loevett is a lesbian and was previously married to actress Aria Bedmar who played Camino Pasamar in period soap opera Acacias 38.\n\nMustii is a familiar figure in Belgian pop after releasing two studio albums and has also been a judge on Drag Race Belgique.\n\nHis entry for Eurovision is \"Before the Party's Over\" and Mustii identifies as queer. In an interview with the queer magazine KET, he revealed that while he initially identified as bisexual, he now prefers to avoid labels altogether. He expressed that he simply wants to believe that he likes 'people, singular free human beings.\"\n\nIn 2023, he cemented his queer credentials by appearing as a judge on Drag Race Belgique, alongside Rita Baga and Lufy.\n\nSwiss singer Nemo is performing \"The Code\" at Eurovision, which is about their experience of coming out as non-binary.\n\nThe singer previously explained that they didn't \"feel like a man or a woman... I had to break a few codes\".\n\n\"'The Code' is about the journey I started with the realisation that I am neither a man nor a woman. Finding myself has been a long and often difficult process for me. But nothing feels better than the freedom I have gained by realising that I am non-binary.\"\n\nThe UK's very own Olly Alexander is performing at Eurovision this year, which he confirmed during the Strictly Come Dancing final in December. He told PinkNews recently he plans to make his performance \"as gay as possible\".\n\nAlexander is known for performing in the band Years and Years as well as acting in the Channel 4 drama It's A Sin.\n\nHe said that performing at Eurovision is a \"dream come true\" and the song he chose is called \"Dizzy\"/\n\nAlexander is well-known for being outspoken about LGBTQ+ rights: he identifies as gay, queer and non-binary. You can read a list of 12 times Olly Alexander proved himself a powerful queer icon here.\n\nSABA is a multi-talented star from Denmark, known for being a singer, musical theatre actress, and model. Known as SABA on stage, her real name is Anna Saba Lykke Oehlenschl\u00e6ger and she will be representing Denmark at Eurovision this year with a song titled \"Sand\".\n\nSABA is LGBTQ+, telling Wiwibloggs in an interview that she is in a relationship with a woman who is very supportive of her musical pursuits. She has said that she is proud to be the first brown, queer woman to sing for Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest 2024.\n\nSilvester Belt is Lithuania's chosen representative at Eurovision 2024. Belt previously took part in the Lithuanian singing competitions A\u0161 - superhitas and The X Factor and will be performing an electro-pop song titled \"Luktelk\" in the contest.\n\nSilvester Belt is bisexual and came out in 2017. He has previously described LGBTQ+ icon Troye Sivan as his \"all-time inspiration\".

Ahead of the 2024 Live Shows, the people behind the performances explain the mechanics, the creativity and the magic that take their ideas from the drawing board onto the stage.\n\nWith 18 acts getting ready to go, the Eurovision delegation area is buzzing. It's the day of the First Semi-Final, and everyone is getting ready for a final dress rehearsal. Silia Kapsis' Liar chorus echoes around as she gets her voice warmed up and ISAAK is giving a performance (including a tune on the nose flute) in the nearby press centre. It's clear from the sheer amount of noise, people and excitement that it's show day. As every performer heads towards the stage, a huge cheer breaks out.\n\nBut before any of the acts could get to this point, a lot of work had to happen. We sat down with some of the teams to find out how they get their country's performances ready.\n\nSome Eurovision artists won their places at Malm\u00f6 through national finals, so they've already had a chance to perform their shows in front of live audiences. That was not the case for Electric Fields from Australia, who created their performance from scratch. So just how do you go from an empty stage to an all-out celebration of Indigenous culture? Emily Griggs, the Head of Delegation for Australia, told Eurovision everything we wanted to know.\n\n\"Creative Director Paul Clarke and I like to approach each song as a story, so we work out what visually can help tell that story. Electric Fields are the same; storytelling is in their DNA,\" she says.\n\nElectric Fields started rehearsing in February but it wasn't until they reached Malm\u00f6 in April that the whole vision could be put together, including the backing vocalists and the Yidaki (or Didgeridoo) player.\n\n\"Once we arrived at the Eurovision stage, we discovered that it posed even more challenges than we had previously realised. It's a vast space with two large runways that can appear quite dark, making it easy for artists to seem small and potentially get lost. We needed to find a new way to conquer the stage,\" Emily explains.\n\nThe solution was to bring everything in and make the stage feel smaller, so that everyone could see the connection between the artists. When everything finally slotted into place, the team were thrilled with the result. And on the day of Australia's First Rehearsal, Zaachariaha was so overcome with emotion that he welled up with tears of pride.\n\n\"This song and performance are a significant cultural moment,\" Emily says. \"This is the first time in history that a Yidaki has been on the Eurovision stage and the first time an Australian act has shared some Indigenous language -- Yankunytjatjara -- on stage.\"\n\nThe swirling LED screen in Electric Fields' performance has also come from somewhere personal. It was inspired by one of Zaachariaha's paintings, which is called Paraulpi. Not just a Eurovision superstar, Zaachariaha also happens to be an accomplished multi-disciplinary artist.\n\nThere's one thing in particular that the Australian team have to consider -- the fact that they have to travel to the other side of the world for Eurovision.\n\n\"Each year, we think about what works for the song, and then we think about how we will realise it. It can mean getting props made in the host country or finding a much-loved car and working out how to get that to fit the stage specs,\" Emily says.\n\nFor the 2024 Contest, they were able to fly to Sweden with everything they needed. Which certainly wasn't the case in 2023 with Voyager's car prop.\n\nFor Nebulossa from Spain, a lot of the ground work had already been done -- they had a stunning show already in place for Spain's national final Benidorm Fest. The next step was working out what needed to change for Malm\u00f6. Ana Mar\u00eda Bordas, Spain's Head of Delegation, says that they wanted to adapt the Benidorm Fest performance, with some choreography and costume changes.\n\nBut there was still plenty of work to do. The team had to adjust every camera shot, get each detail of lighting right and perfect the choreography, as rehearsals unfolded.\n\n\"We changed the costumes for a greater comfort of our singer, Mery, on stage,\" Ana Mar\u00eda says, explaining that they were lucky enough to have designs from Michael Costello.\n\nIceland's team also had a national final performance as a strong starting place. They kicked off their Eurovision preparations by sitting down with the national broadcaster R\u00daV and the artistic team responsible for directing the performance, while also thinking about the technical specifications of the stage in Malm\u00f6. They looked through proposals for the show, then Hera, her choreographer, her director and the rest of the team got to work. And there was no time to rest -- Hera went into rehearsals just two weeks after winning her national final.\n\n\"An important thing is to listen to the artist, who in the end will always be the one performing the show,\" says Iceland's Head of Media, Ragna Bj\u00f6rg \u00c1rs\u00e6lsd\u00f3ttir, who is also a backing vocalist for Hera. \"The artistic team then creates the script with the aim to build up dynamic and wow effects throughout the song. Every frame has to have life, colours, good angles and something happening that catches the eye.\"\n\nEveryone on the team was chosen by Hera herself, and although they knew each other they'd never performed together.\n\n\"We had group dinners leading up to leaving Iceland to go to Malm\u00f6,\" Ragna says. \"We then got the chance to enjoy each other's company and we have all become friends. This has resulted in a close-knit group that stands together with support and energy that radiates between us.\"\n\nComing in as a backing singer, Ragna says she was used to performing but had never had to do a dance routine on stage, and certainly nowhere as big as the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nEmily from Australia says that for her, one of the most amazing things about Eurovision is that each country gets to work on their own song, and then collaborate with the host broadcaster on camera direction, lighting and LED design to bring it all to audiences at home.\n\n\"The collaboration and camaraderie are what are really special,\" she says. \"I know people might find it a little cheesy, but music really does bring us all together. So, I'm here to tell you that the Eurovision slogan really is true: we are United by Music.\"\n\nYou can listen to all 37 songs of Eurovision 2024 via your favourite streaming service or watch the

We expect a lot of manifestations and voicing of opinions during Eurovision week, but nothing points to the manifestations being violent.'\n\nIn order to protest, a permit is required - the police say they've received a few applications for these permits, but none have yet been approved.\n\n'It is extremely uncommon for a permit application of this type to be rejected as the right to hold manifestations is highly protected in the Swedish constitution. Before approval, though, there will be dialogue with the applicants as we need to make sure that we can guarantee safety during the manifestations.'\n\nSweden's recent admission to NATO has also sparked concerns about protests becoming violent, regarding tensions with Russia.\n\nThese worries have seen roughly 10% of the 600 volunteers for Eurovision drop out due to 'personal reasons' and 'security concerns'.\n\nPaulina, 35, was born in Malmo but also grew up in Chile. She's a dancer, is planning to do flash mobs with traditional Palestinian dances to raise awareness about the war.\n\nShe also plans to partake in protests ahead of Eurovision, telling Metro.co.uk: 'I want to protest because I find it horrible, what's happening.\n\n'When I'm at work and people are handling things like nothing is happening, it's a difficult feeling.\n\n'When I come to the demonstrations, at least I'm surrounded by people that care. We've also been writing to artists that are in the event for Eurovision to encourage them to boycott it.\n\n'I want to show the world where Malmo stands. We don't want to welcome the representatives of Israel - it's not normal, it's not okay.'\n\nRisks mentioned ahead of Eurovision include violent protests, heightened terror threats and increased tensions with Russia after Sweden's NATO membership was approved.\n\nIn 2023, Sweden raised its terror level threat to 'high' for the first time since 2016 after protests which burned the Quran triggered protests in the Muslim world.\n\nSwedish police mentioned last month that an application to stage a demonstration to burn the Quran before Eurovision had been handed in, but did not say whether or not it would be approved.\n\nFollowing the increase of Sweden's terror level in August 2023 to level four out of five, other concerns have been raised regarding the potential for a terror attack.\n\nAn ISIS-related attack on Crocus Concert Hall in Moscow this March put many European countries on high alert.\n\nIn early April, ISIS issued a threat for the Champions League match held in London.\n\nSimilar security measures will be taken for attendees, who are likely to pass through an airport security style check when entering venues around the city.\n\nPer-Erik Ebbestahl, Malmo's security director, said: 'There's a high threat level combined with a lot of people.\n\nMultiple times, in fact.\n\nIn 2009, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan flared up when many people who voted for the Armenian song entry were questioned by Azerbaijani police.\n\nIn 2015, Armenia's song entry into the contest had to change its name because of political connotations attached to it, in relation to Azerbaijan.\n\nGeorgia also previously withdrew from the contest in 2009, when in the aftermath of the Russo-Georgian War, they competed with a song called 'We Don't Wanna Put In'.\n\nThe contest refused to allow the entry as they appeared to criticise Putin - Georgia refused to change them, and subsequently withdrew.\n\nRussia and Ukraine has also presented challenges to the 'apolitical' Eurovision song contest.\n\nIn 2016, Ukraine won the contest with the song '1944' which referenced the deportation of Crimean Tatars - despite Russia campaigning against the song.\n\nAfter Russia's invasion into Ukraine in 2022, other participating countries voted to ban Russia from the contest.\n\nNow, the hot topic surrounding this year's competition is Israel's participation - the country has taken part in the contest since 1973.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_hooper@metro.co.uk", "name":

The host country Sweden, plus \"the big 5\" countries - UK, France, Spain, Germany and Italy - all go through automatically to the Final. The other 31 countries have to compete for 20 other spots in two semi-finals taking place on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.\n\nFavourites to win the competition include Switzerland and Croatia.

Saturday's Grand Final will see a tribute to Abba, the Swedish supergroup who began their international career 50 years ago with Eurovision victory in Brighton, UK.\n\nThis year's Contest is taking place against a background of unprecedented political scrutiny.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSweden's 2024 Eurovision twin delegates Marcus & Martinus are no strangers to the stage, having achieved a Top 10 hit in Norway aged nine, and a second consecutive hit, \"Elektrisk\", which remained in the Norwegian charts for 66 weeks.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that the Norwegian duo already have a huge following and are used to playing sold-out arenas around Scandinavia.\n\nThey first attempted to represent their neighbours Sweden at Eurovision in 2023, but were runners-up to Loreen, who went on to win Eurovision last year with her song \"Tattoo\".\n\nNow they're finally getting to live out their Eurovision dreams, performing for Sweden at the Malmo Arena on Saturday 11 in the grand final. They are guaranteed a spot on the finalists list because of Sweden's status as the host country, after Loreen's triumph last year.\n\nRead our Q&A with Marcus & Martinus below:\n\nYes! It's getting closer and closer. To get through and represent Sweden is amazing, it's a dream come true to represent a country with such a big legacy at Eurovision.\n\nHow we started with this song was actually by being inspired by our previous song \"Air\", because we had so many good reactions from Eurovision fans. So we thought, OK, let's make a similar song but upgrade it, make it more \"us\". It's a more Marcus & Martinus vibe, and a very good song for Eurovision, we think.\n\nPeople have told us it reminds us of songs by The Weeknd or Swedish House Mafia, but we actually weren't thinking about other artists, we were thinking more about how it would translate at Eurovision and about the staging for the performance.\n\nNot at all! You have to remember that we got 92 out of 96 points from the public when we competed at Melodifestivalen, so we're just really happy we get to represent them, it's a big honour for us.\n\nThere are a lot of great artists taking part, so we think it will be even tougher this year. We really like the Netherlands' Joost, and Switzerland with Nemo. Olly Alexander (for the UK) too, come on!

Previously, the singer spoke publicly about the bullying he experienced as a child.\n\n\"I want to say to all the bullies: 'I know you were struggling and I'm just sending love. I love you from all my heart.' And to my inner child: 'You little boy, you went through so much. I love you so much, keep going and never give up',\" Silvester Belt said.\n\nA journalist from neighbouring Latvia asked Silvester Belt whether he thinks singing in Lithuanian on the big Eurovision stage was the right choice.\n\n\"Initially, like most Lithuanians, I thought we should send an English song because no one would understand, no one would care [about a song in Lithuanian]. But to be honest, the only people in the world who think that we should sing in English are Lithuanians. The rest of the world is saying that Lithuanian is a beautiful language. I have no regrets, and it adds mystery to the song,\" he said.\n\nIn total, 26 countries will compete in the Eurovision final on Saturday.

Per the official website, Eurovision is an internationally televised songwriting competition, organized by the European Broadcasting Union and featuring participants chosen by EBU member broadcasters representing their countries from across Europe and beyond. Each participating broadcaster has until mid-March to choose a song and an artist to perform it. The song and artist can be selected through a televised national selection show (or shows), an internal process, or via any other means they decide.\n\nThe main rules relating to competing songs and artists are:\n\nIn each show, after all of the songs have been performed, each country will give two sets of points (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12) to their favorite songs; one set is given by a jury of five music industry professionals from that country, and one set is given by viewers watching the show in the country. Viewers can vote by telephone, SMS, and through the official app but out of fairness, you cannot vote for your own country. At the end of the Grand Final, the song that has received the most points wins the iconic trophy and is performed once more.\n\nEurovision 2024 will take place at the Malm\u00f6 Arena in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. Sweden has hosted the contest seven times, with three of them being in Malm\u00f6.

But one institution, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), shines brightest, thanks to its annual celebration of song and sequins: the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nEurovision is staunchly non-political, but that stance has done little to stem the politics both on and behind the stage. Hidden behind beaded costumes, fireworks, and a flaming piano are the same institutional structures, member strategies, and domestic political pressure that regularly support, stress, and bias other attempts at international cooperation.\n\nCurious about Eurovision politics? Here's a primer.\n\nLike many manifestations of European cooperation, the Eurovision Song Contest (aka ESC or Eurovision) arose from efforts to increase economic efficiency - and boost post-World War II European unity. In the early 1950s, only a handful of public broadcasters could afford to produce television programs. As an alliance of public service media, the EBU created the Eurovision Network to generate shared programming.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest was just one component of this broader effort, although it has been the most successful. In 2022, Guinness World Records proclaimed Eurovision the \"longest-running annual international televised music competition in the world.\" While the ESC's debut in 1956 served as an early experiment in live, simulcast, transnational television broadcasting, its subsequent seven-decade run has served as an experiment in multinational cooperation across wars, financial crises, and shifts in national sovereignty.\n\nBroadly speaking, the ESC invites EBU alliance members to submit to the annual competition one new, short song written by a national, to be performed live in the language of their choice by an individual or band that's not larger than six members. Rules on the length, language, number of performers, eligible countries, and even the number of songs per country have changed repeatedly over the years. From 1955 to 1996, national juries of experts distributed points to select the winners. But starting in 1997, some countries began allowing telephone voting from the public.\n\nToday, the ESC selects winners by combining the points provided by the national juries of experts, the nationally aggregated public vote, and the rest-of-world vote. Importantly, neither juries nor the public may vote for the song from their own nation.\n\nIn Eurovision's early years, alliance members' participation was inconsistent. Only seven countries (less than a third of the eligible pool) competed in the first competition in 1956. Today, more than 52 countries have competed at least once, with Sweden and Ireland tied for most wins.\n\nWinning has distinct perks that go beyond the satisfaction of besting the neighbors in front of an estimated world audience of 162 million people. The winning country has the opportunity to host the competition the next year. And the winner gets the added benefit of an automatic bypass into the following year's semi-final selection process.\n\nPost-war broadcasting cooperation in Europe had many false starts as Western European countries sought to limit the power of the Soviet Union within proposed institutional designs. The EBU's members are the broadcasters, not the governments, but sovereignty issues have always been central.\n\nThe EBU is open to all public service broadcasters in the European Broadcasters Area, an area that extends past geographic Europe to include North Africa and the Middle East. To join, broadcasters must be in countries previously recognized by the now-defunct International Broadcasting Union or by the United Nations' International Telecommunication Union (ITU).\n\nThese recognition rules sped along the participation of some countries while creating roadblocks for others. Today, the EBU includes 113 member organizations from 56 countries - participation by member broadcasters from Russia and Belarus currently is suspended. At the same time, the EBU recently extended ESC participation rights to Australia, a country that is very far from its mandate.\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union rapidly expanded the ranks of the EBU and, subsequently, Eurovision submissions, resulting in the development of a semi-final selection process. Since 2000, Eurovision's primary backers - currently France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom - have been able to skip the semi-finals, thanks to an automatic place in the competition's finals.\n\nProtesting this advantage as well as new voting rules, Turkey left the ESC in 2016 despite the competition's domestic popularity. Other countries - most recently Bulgaria, Montenegro, and North Macedonia - have exited due to the costs of participation. In the wake of its and Belarus's suspension, Russia announced the planned 2024 revival of Intervision - a Eurovision substitute composed of Russian allies.\n\nSince its conception, the ESC voting rules have repeatedly changed, slowly incorporating increased direct democracy as a balance against the national juries of experts. Most recently, the rules have allowed votes from \"the rest of the world\" to count, and the ESC also moved to a public-only vote for the two semi-finals in which 31 acts will vie for the 20 open slots in the Grande Finale.\n\nIn the current scheme, jury and public votes combine to select the winner, but the two voting segments have not aligned well. With the 50-50 weighting, 2023 fan favorite \"Cha-Cha-Cha\" by Finnish singer K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4 lost to jury-preferred \"Tattoo\" (the Swedish entry) despite winning the second highest share of the public vote (85%) in Eurovision history. In contrast, the public vote did determine the 2022 winner, sending Ukraine's \"Stefania\" soaring into first place by providing them 94% of the maximum possible points from the public.\n\nThe debate over the use of expert juries mirrors broad democratic debates about the legitimacy of technocrats, especially during the process of European integration. Supporters of juries note that they promote \"non-commercial\" acts and aid diversity. Those opposed - including my son and his friends - question why these particular elites get so much say.\n\nIs there an optimal voting system? The current structure limits the distribution of points by its reliance on rank order. Each national jury ranks their top ten, and thus songs receive 1 to 8, 10, and 12 points, respectively. Thus, even the most popular song can gain no more than 12 points from the jury and only two more points than the second most popular song, regardless of the jurors' assessment of the differential between the favored and less favored songs. The ESC recently updated how individual juror preferences affect the national jury's ranking and, thus, point distribution. The new system preferences juror agreement by under-weighting individual juror rankings that strongly deviate from the majority.\n\nGame theorists Victor Ginsburgh and Juan Moreno-Ternero highlight the distributional consequences of current and previous point distribution rules. They suggest that to overcome potential biases and more effectively distribute excess support, Eurovision would benefit from instituting a voting procedure based on the Shapley value. This alternative to proportionality, developed by Nobel Prize-winning economist Lloyd Shapley, aims to provide a more fair distribution in cooperative games.\n\nHowever, no rules can prevent attempts by national juries or voters to circumvent them via collusion. Indeed, Eurovision 2022 had a six-country vote trading scandal.\n\nSetting aside the direct collusion scandal, standard Eurovision voting highlights institutional political alliances beyond cultural similarity. Countries accuse each other of participating in voting blocs. Cyprus, for instance, gave Greece the maximum 12 points 26 of the 31 times they had the opportunity to do so. 2023 marked the first time in 8 consecutive years that Cyprus didn't award its first place ranking - 12 points - to Greece. In contrast, Cyprus did not give a single point to Turkey until 2003. (Turkey participated for the first time in 1975, soon after invading Cyprus in 1974.) Other consistent pairs are the United Kingdom and Ireland, France and Germany, and Finland and Sweden.\n\nScholars note distinct Eurovision voting blocs but disagree whether these arise from culture and linguistics, or politics. Intriguingly, ESC votes may help better measure the cultural affinity supporting other types of international relations. One literature review by Gad Yair found multiple studies supporting the use of ESC votes to explain trade patterns.\n\nMany in the U.K. claim that the European voters have continued to punish British entries for the outcome of the 2016 referendum, which started Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, aka Brexit. Careful analysis by the BBC tells another story: Britain has fared just as badly post-Brexit referendum as prior to 2016.\n\nMore recently, voting has clearly reflected the public's response to international conflict. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukraine's entry that year received a first or second ranking from the public in all but three countries. In return, Ukraine's public voted heavily for Poland and Lithuania, both of which opened their borders to Ukrainian refugees and have provided vocal support at the E.U. and U.N. The public pattern was so different from the Ukrainian jury, which did not reward those two countries, that Ukraine's culture minister published an apology:\n\nI would like to address our closest friends in Europe and express my personal position on the evaluation given by the jury from Ukraine to Poland and Lithuania. This assessment in no way reflects our real attitude towards you, our closest friends in Europe.\n\nIsrael's participation in 2024 is already fraught. Sweden, the host, has tightened the security in Malmo, where the contest is taking place. The EBU rejected Israel's first and second submissions for being too political due to references to Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023 invasion and hostage-taking. In light of rising protests against Israel's response in Gaza, the current Israeli entry is expected to pay a cost in public voting.\n\nIn 2013, the Greek government moved to immediately shut down Greece's public broadcaster, citing 2008 austerity measures. Then the EBU stepped in to provide protesting employees a temporary satellite channel until domestic uproar led to a reversal in the government's policy. And in 2016, the EBU raised concerns in Poland, when proposed media law changes would have placed the public television broadcaster under the direct control of the government.\n\nIsrael's winning 2018 entry - Toy by Netta - likely saved the independence of Israel's Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC), which had been under siege by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Unhappy with the IPBC's news coverage, the government had passed a bill to split apart the corporation in the name of market competition. When the EBU noted the changes would cost Israel its EBU membership - and thus the opportunity to host the Eurovision competition - Netanyahu reversed course.\n\nThat said, the threat of suspension did little to stop Russia's invasion of fellow members Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine (in 2014 and 2022) as the EBU has, in general, sought to remain \"apolitical.\" In 2014, the crowd booed the Russian entry so loudly that the 2015 hosts utilized anti-booing technology. Russia withdrew in 2017 when Ukraine hosted. Russia, perhaps provocatively, had selected a singer who had performed in Russian-held Crimea, and had then received a three-year travel ban from Ukraine. For its part, Ukraine was unwilling to lift the singer's ban, even when the EBU director threatened to ban Ukraine in return. Even in 2022, the EBU initially stood by Russia's participation and bowed only after numerous other members threatened to boycott. This year, many called for a similar boycott unless the EBU banned Israel, but the movement lost momentum.\n\nEurovision's motto may be \"united by music,\" but countries' selection processes vary as much for Eurovision as the variations within other domestic political structures. Each national broadcaster determines the mechanism to select their country's Eurovision submission. Many countries have relied on closed internal selection by the broadcaster, while others organize national competitions to be judged either by juries or, increasingly, the viewing public.\n\nWhich process results in better songs? According to recent analyses, national competition songs have the better results: 52 out of 67 wins (78%). Of course, any good political scientist would ask this next question: Why do certain countries choose internal selection while others choose national competitions? That would make for an excellent dissertation topic.", "source": {"uri": "goodauthority.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Good Authority"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here are the highs and lows in full - and what came next\n\nGuaranteed to provide a lift in dark times, Eurovision 2024 is set to flounce back on to screens. It started on May 7, with the final taking place this Saturday, May 11.\n\nBritain's representative this year is 33-year-old singer and actor Olly Alexander. Star of It's A Sin and the lead singer of Years & Years, his entry - a thumping bassline electro feverdream, Dizzy - is exactly the sort of thing which Eurovision specialises in. It's camp, catchy and, looked at for more than three seconds, as flimsy as a feather boa on the breeze. Dynamite.\n\nFind out whether the judges in Malm\u00f6 feel the same way by turning into the Grand Final on Saturday May 11, which will be broadcast live 8pm on BBC One. Representing the host nation of Sweden, the event will be MC'ed by Hollywood actress Malin \u00c5kerman (best known for Watchman), who is joined by comedian and Eurovision regular Petra Mede. And, as usual, Graham Norton will be on hand for eyebrows-raised presenting duties. This year, Joanna Lumley will be UK's spokesperson.\n\nBut what happens when the lights fade out? Life as someone who \"once made a t__ of themselves on Eurovision\" can be a bleak place. (Just ask Jemini.) So from the famous to the infamous, it's time to look back at what happened next to all the British acts who've graced the Eurovision stage.\n\nWhere are the Eurovision Song Contest entries now?1957: Patricia Bredin, 'All'\n\n\"All the golden dreams of yesterday,\" crooned Patricia Bredin, the young actress and amateur opera singer from Hull who became Britain's first ever Eurovision contestant, when we joined the contest for its second year. (We would skip the next one, too.) At a nifty one minute and 52 seconds, All remains the UK's shortest Eurovision entry.\n\nBorn in 1935, Bredin went on to appear in several films alongside Sid James and Ian Carmichael, before taking over from Julie Andrews as Guenevere in a Broadway production of Camelot with Richard Burton. She then emigrated to Canada and took to raising cattle.\n\nShe was still performing as recently as 2007, and looked back at her Eurovision appearance fondly, although she was a bit baffled when she was first approached to take part in the contest. She had never watched TV before, and wasn't sure what it involved. \"Television? I'd never heard of it! I didn't know what they were talking about,\" she recalled in 2016. Bredin died on August 13, 2023, aged 88.\n\n1959: Pearl Carr & Teddy Johnson, 'Sing, Little Birdie'\n\nVery much the Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z of their day, Carr & Johnson were both popular and independently successful singers before their marriage in 1955. They arrived on Eurovision at the peak of their fame, which clearly helped: they placed second in that year's contest.\n\nAfter Eurovision, Johnson went on work as a Radio 2 DJ, and appeared in the TV children's programme Crackerjack. In 1987, the couple starred together in a West End revival of Stephen Sondheim's musical Follies. For many years, they lived together in Brinsworth House, an actors' and artists' retirement home in Twickenham. Teddy Johnson died in June 2018, and Pearl Carr followed in February 2020. They were both 98.\n\n1960: Bryan Johnson, 'Looking High, High, High'\n\nOur 1959 contestant Teddy Johnson had auditioned to represent the UK again in 1960, but found himself pipped to the post by his own brother, Bryan, an out-of-work actor. Like Teddy the year before, Bryan finished in second place.\n\nBetter known for his stage roles than his singing, Johnson gave several acclaimed performances in Shakespearean productions, taking comic roles alongside the famous (and famously histrionic) actor-director Sir Donald Wolfit. Recalling his part in Wolfit's King Lear, the impresario called Johnson \"the best Fool I ever had\". He died in 1995.\n\n1961: The Allisons, 'Are You Sure?'\n\nDespite being unrelated (their real names were John Alford and Bob Day), \"John and Bob Allison\" were marketed as Britain's answer to the Everly Brothers, a pair of clean-cut crooning siblings. They came in second place at Eurovision with a distinguished 24 points, and Are You Sure? became a minor hit. The pair climbed back into the top 40 singles chart the following year with Lessons in Love, but disbanded in 1963, making only a few reunion appearances. They gave their last concert together in 2012; Bob Day died a year later.\n\n1962 & 1963: Ronnie Carroll, 'Ring-A-Ding Girl' & 'Say Wonderful Things'\n\nThe Belfast-born plumber's son Ronnie Carroll is the only singer to have represented the UK for two straight years, reaching fourth place both times.\n\nHe went on to make a living performing on luxury cruise ships including the QE2, and released a comeback album, Back on Song, in 2005. He went bankrupt twice; after the second time, he set up a food stall in Camden Market.\n\nMore surprisingly, Carroll brought his sense of humour and showbiz to the world of British politics. He stood for as a candidate for the tiny Rainbow Alliance party in the 1997 General Election, and again in a 2008 by-election for the Make Politicians History party. That name proved horribly prophetic: when he tried his luck again in the 2015 general election, he died four days after nominations closed, but crucially before polling day. As a result, \"The Eurovisionary Carroll\" was a candidate on the ballot.\n\n1964: Matt Monro, 'I Love the Little Things'\n\nAt the time of his Eurovision appearance, London singer Monro (nicknamed \"the man with the golden voice\") had already lent his vocal talents to a Bond movie, singing the theme tune for 1963's From Russia with Love.\n\nAfter placing second in Eurovision, he went on to sing the Oscar-winning title song for 1966 drama Born Free (about the life of Elsa the Lioness), and continued to record and perform until his death from liver cancer in 1985.\n\n1965: Kathy Kirby, 'I Belong'\n\nOnce the highest-paid female singer of her generation, the Marilyn Monroe-esque Kirby brought a radical touch of Sixties spice to Eurovision in 1965, only to finish in second place behind a still more controversial song, Serge's Gainsbourg's edgy and satirical Poup\u00e9e de cire, poup\u00e9e de son, performed by Luxembourg's entry France Gall.\n\nPost-Eurovision, Kirby had two prime-time BBC television hits, The Kathy Kirby Show and Kathy Kirby Sings. She toured with stars including Cliff Richard and Tom Jones, and reportedly had an affair with Bruce Forsyth.\n\nBut after the death in 1971 of her manager and lover Bert Ambrose (42 years her senior), Kirby's career suffered. She was declared bankrupt in 1975, and, having been diagnosed with schizophrenia, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 1979. After being discharged, she moved in with a female fan called Laraine McKay, and caused a media storm when she announced they were planning to marry each other; the relationship came to an end when McKay was arrested and imprisoned for fraud.\n\nKirby retired from singing in 1983 after a glitzy farewell concert in Blackpool, and died in 2011.\n\n1966: Kenneth McKellar, 'A Man Without Love'\n\nScottish pantomime star McKellar shocked Eurovision audiences by performing in a kilt (a last-minute costume decision). It went down badly: he placed ninth, Britain's worst result at the time.\n\nDespite his Euroflop, McKellar's eclectic singing career endured until the mid-Nineties, highlights including an acclaimed musical setting of Robert Burns's poems, and his popular recording of Song of the Clyde, used as the opening theme for 1963 film Billy Liar.\n\nMore surprisingly, he recorded an Afrikaans-language album in 1970, and wrote a comedy sketch that Monty Python performed at the Secret Policemen's Ball. He died in the USA in 2010, and was brought back home to be buried in Paisley.\n\n1967: Sandie Shaw, 'Puppet on a String'\n\nBritain's first Eurochamp was a likely winner from the outset; she'd already had a UK number one in 1964, and having also recorded her hit singles in French, Italian, German and Spanish, she was equally popular on the continent.\n\nBut she wasn't proud of her Eurovision-winning song. \"I hated it from the very first oompah to the final bang on the big bass drum,\" she once said. \"I was instinctively repelled by its sexist drivel and cuckoo-clock tune.\" Still, it didn't hamper her pop career, with further hits well into the Eighties (prompting fan-mail from The Smiths' Morrissey and Johnny Marr).\n\nSince the Nineties, however, Shaw has worked as a psychotherapist; she finally announced her complete retirement from music in 2013. In 2017, she received an MBE for services to music. She has also been a political campaigner: in 2012, she joined an Amnesty International push against human rights abuses in Azerbaijan, that year's host country; and she campaigned against Brexit in 2016.\n\n1968 & 1973: Cliff Richard, 'Congratulations' & 'Power to All Our Friends'\n\nBorn Harry Webb in Lucknow, now Sir Cliff (OBE), the octogenarian is still going strong, having sold over 21 million singles in the UK across his half-century career. He did rather well at Eurovision, too, reaching second (1968) and third place (1973).\n\nHe has been a fixture of British cultural life ever since. In 2018, he released his first studio album of new material for 14 years, Rise Up, which dealt with his acrimonious legal battle with the BBC. (In 2014, Richard had been investigated as part of Operation Yewtree over allegations of historical sexual abuse, but he was never arrested for any offence. The BBC controversially broadcast a search of his home, and have since been forced to pay out substantial damages.)\n\n1969: Lulu, 'Boom Bang-a-Bang'\n\nScottish pop supernova and TV personality Lulu won 1969's Eurovision in a four-way tie with Spain, France and the Netherlands.\n\nShe went on to score number one singles in the UK and America, and sang the theme for 1974 Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun. (That said, in America she's perhaps better known as the voice behind the chart-busting title theme for the 1967 film To Sir, With Love.)\n\nIn 2011 she took part in Strictly Come Dancing, and in 2014 sang at the closing ceremony for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. In 2018 she returned to the London stage in West End musical 42nd Street, and was a special guest on Take That's Greatest Hits Live tour. She was honoured with a CBE in 2021.\n\n1970: Mary Hopkin, 'Knock, Knock, Who's There?'\n\nWelsh folk singer Hopkin gave the UK another second place at Eurovision, after a string of hit singles including Goodbye (written and produced by Paul McCartney).\n\nAfter she married top producer Tony Visconti in 1971, she withdrew from the limelight, but still sang on several albums he produced, including David Bowie's Low. After a late-Seventies comeback, she joined a group called Oasis (not the Gallaghers' band), and sang on Vangelis's soundtrack for Blade Runner. .\n\nIn 2018, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of her break out single Those Were the Days, produced by Paul McCartney, Hopkin released a new acoustic version of the track. She is still recording, and released her last studio album in 2023 on her 73rd birthday with her daughter Jessica Lee Morgan\n\n1971: Clodagh Rodgers, 'Jack In The Box'\n\nYoung Northern Irish singer Clodagh Rodgers received death threats from the IRA when she agreed to represent the UK at the 1971 Eurovision, staged in Dublin. She took the stage nonetheless, and finished in a decent fourth place.\n\nShe only had one post-Eurovision chart single (Lady Love Bug, in late 1971), but continued a ropey recording career for several years, releasing her last new studio album in 1977. She would have better luck on stage, touring with the West End musical Blood Brothers in the Nineties before retiring from the music business in 2015.\n\n1972: The New Seekers, 'Beg, Steal or Borrow'\n\nThe New Seekers were only tenuously linked to their Australian parent-group by original Seeker Keith Podger, who left the band before it brought Britain yet another second-place result with its saccharine harmonies. They disbanded in 1974, but have reappeared in various shifting incarnations over the years, most recently in a 2006 tour, which only featured one member of their Eurovision line-up (Paul Layton).\n\n1974: Olivia Newton-John, 'Long Live Love'\n\nAfter taking Britain to fourth place in Eurovision (beaten by ABBA's Waterloo), Newton-John was immortalised on the big screen as Sandy in 1978's Grease. She found further chart success with the soundtrack to Electric Light Orchestra musical Xanadu in 1980 (though the film itself was a flop) and solo recordings including I Honestly Love You and Physical. She won four Grammys and became one of the best-selling female artists of all time. Newton-John was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992 and became a passionate advocate for cancer research. She battled the disease three times before her death aged 73 in 2022.\n\n1975: The Shadows, 'Let Me Be The One'\n\nFormerly Cliff Richard's backing band, The Shadows were best known for instrumental hits such as Apache, but made an impressively laid-back foray into vocal harmonies for Eurovision, placing second (again!) despite obviously forgetting the words at one point.\n\nThe band went on to considerable worldwide success, and the then-current members were all offered OBEs in 2004 (though lead guitarist Hank Marvin declined his). They played their farewell tour in 2009. \"Everyone thinks screaming was invented with Beatlemania,\" the band told The Telegraph, \"but Cliff had his own mania.\"\n\n1976: Brotherhood of Man, 'Save Your Kisses for Me'\n\nAfter winning Eurovision, the ABBA-esque Save Your Kisses for Me became the biggest-selling Eurovision winner to date, prompting a series of international tours, but the Brotherhood's hits dried up by the end of the decade. They have reunited sporadically since splitting up in 1984 but decided to retire from touring in 2022.\n\n1977: Lynsey de Paul & Mike Moran, 'Rock Bottom'\n\nBritain came second (yup, it's catching) with this jaunty honky-tonk duet, though after a few follow-up singles the pair went their separate ways. Afterwards, Moran became the producer of the long-running children's music TV show Get It Together, while de Paul (after a few pop releases) moved into classical music, releasing albums of Bach and Handel. In 1982, she starred with Ian McKellen, Joanna Lumley and Helen Mirren in a West End panto production of Cinderella.\n\nDe Paul also made a police-approved self-defence video, worked as OK! magazine's staff cartoonist, and once released a concept album of children's pop songs about the Channel Tunnel. She died in October 2014.\n\n1978: Co-Co, 'The Bad Old Days'\n\nOriginally called Mothers Pride and finishing in 11th place, Co-Co split up soon after their Eurovision humiliation, having only released one album. But their real importance is as a prelude: band member Cheryl Baker would be back just three years later with her new group, Bucks Fizz, and would win the competition.\n\n1979: Black Lace, 'Mary Ann'\n\nNovelty foursome Black Lace may have made little impact at Eurovision (placing seventh), but they would achieve undying notoriety five years later, when they released the hellishly catchy earworm Agadoo (once heralded by Q Magazine as The Worst Song of All Time, according to a panel of expert music writers). Another dubious career highlight came in 2003, when band member Colin Gibb put out an X-rated Black Lace album called The Blue (released in Tenerife). In 2016, he reunited with singer Gordon King for what was billed as the band's 40th anniversary tour. Alan Barton died in a coach crash in 1995 while touring with Smokie, while Rob Hopcraft died as a result of a fall in May 2020.\n\n1980: Prima Donna, 'Love Enough for Two'\n\nPrima Donna were part of a tangled Eurovision dynasty: one singer Danny Finn, was formerly in The New Seekers, our 1972 entry, while fellow band-member Lance Aston was the brother of Bucks Fizz singer, and future 1981 winner, Jay Aston. Prima Donna's Sally Ann Triplett, meanwhile, would return to Eurovision two years after that, as one half of UK entry Bardo.\n\nUnable to hold together such a powerful nexus of Europop talent, the band's flame burned only briefly; our 1980 hope had disbanded before the year was over.\n\n1981: Bucks Fizz, 'Making Your Mind Up'\n\nNotorious for their skirt-ripping dance routine, Bucks Fizz not only blazed to victory at Eurovision but also went on to sell 15 million records worldwide, with further UK number one hits including The Land of Make Believe and My Camera Never Lies.\n\nBut in 1984, tragedy struck: a bus crash broke the spine of band member Cheryl Baker, and sent fellow singer Mike Nolan into a three-day coma, causing injuries from which he has never fully recovered. Creative difference led to a legal battle over the rights to the band name in the late Nineties and early Noughties, in what The Telegraph later called \"one of the messiest break-ups in music history\".\n\nGoing by The Fizz, Baker, Nolan and Aston got back together in 2009 and embarked on a UK-wide tour. In the 2019 general election, Aston briefly became a politician when she stood for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in Kensington, but received less than 1 per cent of the vote. Their third studio album, Smoke & Mirrors, was released in March, reaching 29th in the charts. They are currently back on tour.\n\n1982: Bardo, 'One Step Further'\n\nCrackerjack presenter and former Prima Donna member Sally Ann Triplett only reached seventh place with this duet, joined by her real-life romantic partner Stephen Fischer. Fischer went on to work as a keyboardist with Boy George and Bob Geldof, while Triplett has found success in Broadway musicals and on the West End stage.\n\n1983: Sweet Dreams, 'I'm Never Giving Up'\n\nThis now-forgotten teenage pop trio finished in sixth place. When their follow-up single failed to chart, the band split up just a few months after Eurovision. Pretty boy Bobby McVay became a local radio presenter, before joining Bucks Fizz on their 2015 reunion tour, while fellow dreamer Carrie Grant became a vocal coach, returning to Eurovision in 2014 to head the UK's expert jury.\n\n1984: Belle and the Devotions, 'Love Games'\n\nThe poor behaviour of British football fans at a 1983 Luxembourg match meant that this trio were greeted with boos as they took the stage in Luxembourg for Eurovision 1984. Their Supremes-like love song finished in seventh place, and the band split up soon afterwards, though \"Belle\" (real name: Kit Rolfe) would return to Eurovision in 1991 as a backing singer for Britain's Samantha Janus. Rolfe also recorded an unsuccessful novelty single with failed Olympic skier Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards.\n\n1985: Vikki, 'Love Is...'\n\nVictoria Watson was our first female Eurovision entry to perform a self-penned song. Her ballad only came in fourth place, but Watson has since used her ethereal vocals to great effect, after changing her name, moving to Los Angeles and rebranding herself as an Celtic-influenced ambient folk singer.\n\nShe hasn't made much of an impact on the pop world, putting out a string of online-only releases before a 2015 comeback album. But she's a big name in Hollywood sound-design: her atmospheric, wordless vocals have been used on more than 70 film trailers, including The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies and the 2016 Dan Brown adaptation Inferno.\n\nShe now performs under the name Aeone (pronounced \"ay-own\"). According to her website, the new name means \"an endless period of time that is essentially female, feeling without thinking\".\n\n1986: Ryder, 'Runner in the Night'\n\nThe pop sextet Ryder (led by singer Maynard Williams) were manufactured created purely to take part in Eurovision. The result was a disaster: their song only placed seventh in the competition, and didn't even scrape into the top 75 in the UK singles chart, making it the worst commercial flop of any British Eurovision entry. In 1987, Williams sang the theme tune for the BBC sitcom Truckers, also better forgotten. After popping up in a 1996 episode of Heartbeat, he seemingly retired from showbiz for good.\n\n1987: Rikki, 'Only the Light'\n\nLike \"Vikki\" before him and \"Emma\" after, the mononymous Scottish singer Rikki seems to have chosen his name with a view to future anonymity: it's not so much a pop rebrand as a Eurovictim protection programme, helping failed entrants to hide their shame.\n\nBorn Richard Peebles, he arrived at the door of Eurovision having previously written a few songs for a middle-of-the-road pop band called Middle of the Road. Rikki finished in 13th place, and never made it into the UK top 75 chart. After a botched 1987 debut album, he has avoided the limelight, writing songs for club performers.\n\nWhen The Mirror tracked him down for a 1996 interview, he recalled how badly he had been hurt by Eurovision. \"I cried,\" he said. \"I thought I had let my country down in front of all those millions of viewers. I would never, ever do it again.\"\n\n1988: Scott Fitzgerald, 'Go'\n\nThe overwrought ballad Go was yet another second-place near-miss for the UK. It was written by Bruce Forsyth's daughter Julie, who joined Scottish singer Fitzgerald onstage for Eurovision in Dublin. Fitzgerald was raised on a Glasgow tenement where, in his early childhood, he befriended a girl called Marie Lawrie - who grew up to become the 1969 Eurovision winner Lulu. His own pop career stalled after his silver medal 19 years later, but his son Ki Fitzgerald has fared better - he's a founding member of Noughties boy band Busted.\n\n1989: Live Report, 'Why Do I Always Get it Wrong?'\n\nFor Eurovision voters, Live Report clearly got something right, receiving the most perfect 12-point scores from judges. Sadly, it wasn't enough to win: Britain came second (there's a theme emerging, here) to Yugoslavia. The band's lead singer Ray Caruana is actually Maltese, and was later a runner-up in the contest to represent Malta for Eurovision 1994.\n\n1990: Emma, 'Give a Little Love Back to the World'\n\nAt just 15 years old, Emma Booth remains Britain's youngest Eurovision contestant. Her song finished sixth and broke into the UK top 40, but, in what was by now a fine British tradition, her follow-up single failed to chart.\n\nAccording to the local news site Wales Online, as of 2004 Booth was making a living singing on cruise ships. Her other post-Eurovision work involved touring with the Chuckle Brothers, and supporting Keith Harris and Orville the Duck.\n\n1991: Samantha Janus, 'A Message to Your Heart'\n\nAfter placing 10th in Eurovision, Brighton-born Samantha quit the pop world for a career in acting, playing Sandy in a West End revival of Grease. She is best known, however, for playing the icy Ronnie Mitchell in EastEnders from 2007-2017.\n\n1992: Michael Ball, 'One Step Out of Time'\n\nAlready a successful West End musical performer, Ball took the UK to second place (again!) in Eurovision, before hosting his own ITV music show, and releasing a string of gold-selling albums. He still performs regularly, and presents a show on BBC Radio 2. In 2015, he received an OBE for services to musical theatre.\n\nIn March 2019, Ball released the album Coming Home To You, which became his first number one album as a solo artist in almost three decades. The same year, he performed in a placeholder production of Les Mis\u00e9rables with long-time collaborator Alfie Boe, while the West End production moved theatres. His NHS-fundraising cover of You'll Never Walk Alone, with Capt Tom Moore, topped the charts during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n1993: Sonia, 'Better the Devil You Know'\n\nLiverpool singer Sonia Evans came second (again!) in Eurovision with this rock 'n' roll number, having already racked up several UK chart hits (most notably 1989's You'll Never Stop Me Loving You). When her recording career hit a post-Eurovision slump, she took to the London stage, briefly playing Sandy in Grease (before handing over the role to our 1991 entry Samantha Janus).\n\nAfterwards, she slid into reality television (ITV's Reborn in the USA, a 2003 vehicle for has-been pop stars) and regional panto. But in 2012, she had a one-off return to a major stage, performing at London's O2 Arena for a Hit Factory Live concert alongside Kylie Minogue. She signed a new record deal with Energise Records in 2019, and released the single A Night That's Never Ending later that year.\n\n1994: Frances Ruffelle, 'We Will Be Free (Lonely Symphony)'\n\nAfter placing 10th in 1994 with We Will Be Free, Ruffelle followed several other Eurovisionistas into musical theatre. She has found success in the West End, appearing in Trevor Nunn's Tony Award-winning RSC Les Mis\u00e9rables, and playing the title role in Piaf. In 2017, she starred in the musical The Wild Party, at Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End venue The Other Palace.\n\n1995: Love City Groove, 'Love City Groove'\n\nBritain's first foray into Eurovision hip-hop reached number seven in the charts, but only placed tenth in the contest. The group's rapper Stephen \"Beanz\" Rudden has since found work as a jobbing producer, writing the theme tune for 1998's forgotten Kelsey Grammer comedy The Real Howard Spitz.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul Hardy (who sang the chorus) tried to rise from the ashes by rebranding himself Paul Phoenix and signing up to compete on BBC One's The Voice in 2016. Sadly, he didn't even make it through the initial blind-audition round.\n\n1996: Gina G, 'Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit'\n\nBorn and raised in Australia, Gina Gardiner's saucy pop tune didn't go down well at Eurovision (placing seventh), but it became a UK number one. Despite a successful debut album, she left the music industry following a lengthy legal battle with her producer. She tried to make a comeback in 2005, competing unsuccessfully to represent Britain in Eurovision again. She then moved to Los Angeles to run her own record label, Stunt Girl Music.\n\n1997: Katrina and the Waves, 'Love Shine a Light'\n\nIn 1997, Katrina and the Waves were no longer Walking on Sunshine, with their Eighties heyday a distant memory. But winning Eurovision in 1997 brought them back into the limelight, giving them their biggest-selling UK single to date. Later that year, lead singer Katrina Leskanich caused a tabloid rumpus when she was photographed kissing comedian Caroline Aherne at a Sony Awards dinner. Leskanich left the band in 1998, finding work as a Radio 2 DJ, releasing several (non-chart) solo albums, and co-authoring a travel guide to London with her pet poodle, Peggy Lee. As of 2023, she was still touring.\n\n1998: Imaani, 'Where Are You'\n\nImaani's song Where Are You came a very respectable second to Israel's Dana International. Released as a single, it remained in the UK charts for over two months, but Imaani was dropped by EMI before a follow up single.\n\nShe continues to perform regularly alongside jazz-funk band Incognito. Her first solo album, Standing Tall, was released in 2014, but it failed to chart. No UK act since has exceeded her Eurovision score of 166, which remains her greatest career achievement to date.\n\n1999: Precious, 'Say It Again'\n\nGirl band Precious split up the year after they competed in Eurovision, having released just four singles. The song they took to Jerusalem in 1999, Say It Again, gained only 38 points.\n\nTheir best-known member was Jenny Frost, who went on to join Atomic Kitten in 2000. Replacing Kerry Katona, Frost released three number one singles with the group before they split in 2004. Her more recent exploits have included appearing in I'm A Celebrity... in 2005, presenting the BBC Three show Snog, Marry Avoid? and becoming the face of homeopathic medicine company Nelson's. She would, in turn, be re-replaced by Katona in 2012.\n\nAmong the other Precious members, Sophie McDonnell had a brief spell as a presenter on CBBC, while lead singer Louise Rose went into acting, and has appeared in Moving Wallpaper and Luther. Kalli Clark-Sternberg is now a session-singer, while Anya Lahiri is a boot-camp trainer.\n\n2000: Nicki French, 'Don't Play That Song Again'\n\nFrench sang Don't Play That Song Again to the crowds in Stockholm in 2000. They seemed to agree, awarding the UK just 28 points.\n\nThese days, French performs at Pride events across the world, and has appeared on British theatre stages too, starring in Menopause: The Musical in 2007. Despite not coming out top in Eurovision, her entry was nonetheless released in a 2015 special edition EP, along with a four-disc anthology album, One Step Further.\n\n2001: Lindsay D, 'No Dream Impossible'\n\nAt 16, Lindsay Dracass represented the UK with the song No Dream Impossible in 2001. The song placed 15th, and after one European tour and the single hitting number 32 in the charts, she went back to being a normal British teenager. She now works as a vocal coach. In November 2019, she released a new album, Waiting for You.\n\n2002: Jessica Garlick, 'Come Back'\n\nAfter being among the last 10 contestants on Pop Idol 2002, Welsh singer Garlick represented the UK in Tallinn. Her score of 111 points made her the highest scoring British act of the 2000s, and won her (joint) third place. She featured in a number of subsequent Eurovision analysis programmes, including the following year's UK selection show, A Song For Europe.\n\nShe embarked on a solo career in 2009, but has never really escaped Eurovision, releasing her first single the day before the semi-final, and giving her first live performance at the Eurovision Preview Party 2009. Other notable appearances include featuring on the identity parade in BBC panel show Never Mind the Buzzcocks in 2006.\n\n2003: Jemini, 'Cry Baby'\n\nAfter gaining notoriety for coming last in the 2003 contest in Latvia, gaining the dreaded score of \"nul points\" for Cry Baby, Liverpudlian duo Jemini were dropped by their record company. Gemma Abbey subsequently worked in a car showroom, while Chris Cromby found employment in a clothes shop.\n\nThat wasn't the end of their Eurovision career though. The pair were (for some reason) interviewed for the 2013 BBC special How To Win Eurovision, and reunited in 2014 for a Eurovision special episode of BBC game show Pointless Celebrities.\n\nIn 2016, Abbey was convicted of benefits fraud. The singer had claimed over \u00a367,000 in tax credits as a single mother, despite being married; officials found photographs of her wedding on Facebook.\n\n2004: James Fox, 'Hold On To Our Love'\n\nWelsh singer James Fox followed up his 16th-place finish by writing and recording the official 2008 FA Cup song for Cardiff FC. Since then he has become a fixture in musical theatre, recently playing Paul McCartney in the West End and Broadway runs of Beatles musical Let It Be. He has also supported a range of celebrities, including Tina Turner, Wet Wet Wet and Lulu. He is still energetically releasing new music.\n\n2005: Javine Hylton, 'Touch My Fire'\n\nIn a shock vote, Javine was chosen to represent the UK over Katie Price's autotune-defying offering Not Just Anybody. Her song, Touch My Fire, came 22nd (of 24) in the final. She continued a career as an R&B singer and television personality, appearing on Never Mind The Buzzcocks and Skins. She won Channel 4 game show The Games in 2006, and came second in Celebrity Come Dine With Me in 2010. She is now the face of Javine Total Fitness, her own sports and fitness brand.\n\n2006: Daz Sampson, 'Teenage Life'\n\nDaz Sampson represented the UK in Eurovision after releasing several reasonably successful dance tracks in the UK and Europe. His co-written entry Teenage Life, featuring backing dancers dressed as school girls known as The Sampsonites, perhaps slightly misjudged the age and sexuality of the average Eurovision viewer and only scored 25 points. It proved more popular with the home crowd however, charting at 8 in the UK Top 40.\n\nIn 2011 Sampson re-launched himself as a hypnotist, telling the Manchester Evening News he intended to \"quit the recording studio and help make the world become a happier and a healthier place.\" A Twitter feed associated with Daz (which describes him as a fortune-teller, inter alia), announced in May 2015 that he would soon be \"back in the studio [...] i want to say sorry in advance for what comes out. but i have a family to feed.\" No new tracks have since emerged, so Sampson's family are presumably still peckish.\n\nSampson also works as a professional football manager and scout, with links to Scottish Championship side Ayr United and Stockport County in England's National League North.\n\n2007: Scooch, 'Flying the Flag (For You)'\n\nIt may surprise viewers of Scooch's airline-themed Eurovision appearance to learn that this was not the group's first TV performance. In fact, in 1999 they won the opportunity to have a single released after beating a rival band in a competition on TV show Live & Kicking.\n\nDespite mixed sentiment surrounding Scooch's entry (Charlotte Church described the act as \"absolute s---\", and Swedish singer Pandora accused Flying The Flag of plagiarism), the act were the first in five years to receive \"douze points\" for the UK, winning the maximum score from Malta.\n\nDisappointingly, none of the band now work for an airline. Natalie Powers is a singing coach at a performing arts school, David Ducasse works at a vets while Caroline Barnes and Russ Spencer started a relationship post-Eurovision, and became one of the longest lasting couples on series 4 of Channel 4 game show Coach Trip in 2010.\n\n2008: Andy Abraham, 'Even If'\n\nX-Factor runner-up Andy Abraham's performance of Even If came joint last in Belgrade in 2008. But he remained on the UK stage, touring the show An Evening with Andy Abraham for two years after the contest. More recently, he played both Judas and John the Baptist in a touring revival of the musical Godspell, alongside his successor at Eurovision, Jade Ewen.\n\n2009: Jade Ewen, 'It's My Time'\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber led the UK selection programme which voted Jade Ewen as the 2009 UK entry, and played piano alongside her in the song It's My Time. Ewen placed fifth in the end, gaining points from 31 countries.\n\nLike 1999 contestant Jenny Frost, she went on to join a three-piece girl band that has a fairly constant rotation of members: the Sugababes. In 2013 she was the first celebrity to be eliminated on BBC game show Splash!.\n\n2010: Josh Dubovie, 'That Sounds Good To Me'\n\nJosh Dubovie was the third UK entry to place last in 10 years, his song That Sounds Good To Me winning only 10 points.\n\nHe has since changed his stage name to Josh James, as searches including Dubovie only returned results relating to Eurovision, preventing him from forging a new reputation. His debut solo single was released in 2013, peaking at number 179. His website lists his current occupations as \"mindset coach, dreamer, dad and entrepreneur\".\n\n2011: Blue, 'I Can'\n\nTen years after the boyband formed, Blue marked their return to showbiz by performing the song I Can. The song placed 11th, and the band complained they were the victims of political voting.\n\nTheir limited company, Blueworld Touring No1 Ltd dissolved in 2014, and since then every member of Blue has declared themselves bankrupt. Blue had a one album and one single deal with Sony for 2015's Colours, which sold over 8,500 copies in its first week on sale. Following the tour of Colours, members Lee Ryan and Duncan James went on to have acting careers in EastEnders and Hollyoaks respectively. The group released their sixth studio album Heart & Soul in 2022.\n\n2012: Engelbert Humperdinck, 'Love Will Set You Free'\n\nTraditional crooner Engelbert Humperdinck was put forward to represent the UK through internal selection. Performing with no sequins on his outfit and no backing dancers at all, he placed second last with 12 points.\n\nNow in his eighties, Humperdinck has sold more than 140 million records and continues to tour, but Love Will Set You Free rarely makes an appearance on his set-lists.\n\n2013: Bonnie Tyler, 'Believe In Me'\n\nTyler may have been past her Eighties heyday (when she had a string of hit ballads such as Total Eclipse of the Heart), but she still won plaudits from the critics for her Eurovision single. Tyler was the first UK entrant to receive the Eurovision Song Contest Radio Awards for Best Song and Best Female Singer.\n\nThat didn't change the fact that her performance of Believe In Me came a lowly 19th. Unlike some previous entries, its poor performance at Eurovision was repeated in the UK market, only reaching a peak chart position of 93.\n\nNonetheless, she has continued to record and perform as if it never happened. She released her most recent album in April this year.\n\n2014: Molly Smitten-Downes, 'Children of the Universe'\n\nChildren Of The Universe, Molly's self-penned ballad designed to \"break down political boundaries\", seemed a subtle attempt from the UK internal selection committee to actually make an impact, and before the final the UK was among the favourites to win. It was not to be however, with Smitten-Downes winning only 40 points on the night.\n\nHer musical career hasn't progressed a huge amount since then, her only noteworthy release being a guest appearance on a 2015 track by German DJ Zwette.\n\n2015: Electro Velvet, 'Still in Love With You'\n\nThis likeable (and unfairly mocked) electro-swing duo comprised The X Factor and The Voice reject Bianca Nicholas, and Alex Larke, the Mick Jagger part of a Rolling Stones tribute act. Alas, after placing 24th in Eurovision, plans for a debut LP were shelved due to Nicholas's poor health. Nicholas, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, has become a prominent public face for people living with the condition, and in December 2016 she released a cover-version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. In February 2017, Larke released his debut solo single, Shine On.\n\n2016: Joe and Jake, 'You're Not Alone'\n\nLight-rock duo Joe Woolford and Jake Shakeshaft (from Ruthin and Stoke-on-Trent, respectively) are still together and still gigging in small venues. In October 2016, the band played a charity fundraising gig at the Ruthin Farmers Auction to raise money for a local girl's medical treatment. That same month, they tweeted that they were recording \"lots of songs\", but only one follow-up to their Eurovision single has been released: 2017's Tongue Tied, which failed to chart.\n\n2017: Lucie Jones, 'Never Give Up on You'\n\nThe 27-year-old X-Factor contestant was the bookies' fifth-favourite to win the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest, but the singer finished in 15th place, blaming Brexit for her disappointing result. Since the show, Jones has turned her attention to musicals, appearing as Holly in the UK tour of The Wedding Singer, and reprising her role as Elle Woods in a nine-month run of Legally Blonde. In 2019, she was cast in the West End musical Waitress, and after a hiatus, returned to the role after the coronavirus pandemic closed the theatres. She won best takeover performance at the WhatsOnStage Awards in 2023, and starred in Wicked and Les Miserables.\n\n2018: SuRie, 'Storm'\n\nSuRie, born Susanna Marie Cork, finished 24th in 2018's Eurovision Song Contest. In 2015, she provided backing vocals for Belgium's Eurovision entry, and in 2017 she was the musical director for another Belgian contestant.\n\nHer own performance was notable for its interruption. SuRie was thrown off when a protester stormed the stage, took the microphone and shouted \"Modern Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom, war is not peace.\" She was diagnosed with PTSD after the incident.\n\nHer follow-up singles have failed to chart in the UK.\n\n2019: Michael Rice, 'Bigger Than Us'\n\nMichael Rice finished dead last in the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest, the UK's fourth bottom-placed finish. Rice had previously won the BBC One singing competition All Together Now, and appeared in the 11th series of The X Factor in 2014.\n\nFollowing Eurovision, Rice released the single Somebody, which failed to chart, and performed in small venues across the UK. In the build-up to last year's aborted show, he appeared on a number of local radio stations to comment on James Newman's UK entry.\n\n2021: James Newman, 'Embers'\n\nNewman was due to represent the UK at the 2020 contest, but after that was nixed by the pandemic, he was instead chosen as our sacrificial lamb for Eurovision 2021. Sadly, a global pandemic didn't ameliorate Britain's chances and Newman's bland entry, Embers, joined a select club and scored \"nul points\".\n\nThe 37-year-old Londoner doesn't lack musical talent - he won a Brit award in 2014 for co-writing Rudimental's hit Waiting All Night - but his career hasn't exactly caught fire since Eurovision: to date, he has released no new music.\n\n2022: Sam Ryder, 'SPACE MAN'\n\nRecognition at last! British glitter lovers could finally hold their heads high again as the genial 33-year-old romped home to second place behind that year's predictable (and deserved) winners Ukraine.\n\nCatchy and heartfelt, with an Elton John-esque belter of a chorus, his ballad was undeniably the best song we've submitted for some time. (In fact, the last time we placed so highly was in 1998 with Imanni's Where Are You.)\n\nBut what sealed the deal for Ryder was his Tigerish bounce and unmistakable joy at the whole shebang. An inspiration.\n\n2023: Mae Muller, 'I Wrote A Song'\n\n... And what a bruising experience that proved. Muller's entry was a decent hit of affirmative revenge pop, sending up a needy ex-boyfriend in fine style - a nice representation of her appeal to the Gen Z, TikTok crowd.\n\nAlas, the UK's flame-out into second-last place all-but-killed her singing career. Muller released a follow-up album, but it was a damb squib and in January this year she dropped her label and announced her intention to work as a solo artist. So far, the 26-year-old singer has released no new music, though her social media has been teasing its appearance.\n\nBut if that comes to naught, she can always fall back on her acting: she appeared in street gang drama Gassed Up in February.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristram_fane_saunders@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Tristram Fane Saunders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_Donna_(British_band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prima Donna (British band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Bredin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patricia Bredin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Sure?_(The_Allisons_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Are You Sure?

Groups with provocative styles and appalling content aren't even trying to contribute to music; they're just shocking for the sake of shock.\n\n'This isn't talent, it's absurdity, which repels.'\n\nAnother complained: 'Olly Alexander's performance was much too raunchy. It needs to be toned down a lot.'\n\nThe routine, which is guaranteed to be in Saturday's final, sees the singer don a distressed vest and red trousers and a colour-coordinated jock strap over the top.\n\nDuring the performance, Olly sensually runs his hands over the dancer's shirtless bodies before they thrust to the beat of the song together.\n\nThings began to go pear-shaped during a performance this week when his microphone pack slipped from his trousers forcing him to continue the song while attempting to grab the pack which dangled underneath, no doubt contributing to the 'shaky' vocals some fans complained about.\n\nNoting the uncomfortable performance, one fan mused: 'It seems like some Eurovision fans are worried about Olly Alexander's vocals after his live performance of the UK entry.\n\n'The addition of shirtless dancers and raunchy moves may have distracted from his singing abilities. Hopefully he can work on improving his vocals before the competition.'\n\nEurovision fans have blasted the 2024 competition for being a 'provocative' and 'raunchy' x Factor rip off\n\nSlovenia's Raiven, who performs her track Veronika in an almost see through gown was also criticised online for her choice of attire.\n\nOne distressed fan said: 'Slovenia needs to really up their costume. Raiven please get better clothes.\n\n'Dress up for a family friendly show. Eurovision management do your job. Participants need to dress appropriately.'\n\nOther fans have accused the competition of overtly mimicking the X Factor in its presentation of acts, and suggested it is a bid to keep hold of the Gen Z crowd.\n\nThe competition has already been mired in controversy this year due to the inclusion of Israel, with some pro-Palestinians adamant they should not be invited due to their ongoing actions in the Gaza strip.\n\nEurovision organisers rebuked one of the Eurovision 2024 opening acts for wearing a keffiyeh during the first semi-final last night.\n\nSwedish singer Eric Saade, who was one of three former contestants opening the contest in Malmo, tied the scarf - which has become a symbol of support for Palestine amid the conflict in the Middle East - around his wrist.\n\nSaade, who is of Palestinian origin, came third for Sweden at the 56th Eurovision Song Contest in 2011 and has repeatedly expressed his opposition to Israel's involvement this time around.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, said: 'The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show.\n\n'All performers are made aware of the rules of the Contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.'\n\nSwedish singer Eric Saade has been rebuked by Eurovision organisers for wearing a keffiyeh while opening the first semi-final\n\nThe scarf which was tied round his wrist has become a symbol of support for Palestine amid the conflict in the Middle East\n\nSaade was joined by Eleni Foureira (left) and Chanel (centre) to open the event in Malmo, Sweden\n\nSaade was joined by fellow song contest alums Eleni Foureira, who came second in 2018 for Cyprus, and Chanel, who finished third for Spain in 2022, when he appeared with the keffiyeh wrapped around his wrist in clear view.\n\nIt is not the only difficulty the event has faced regarding the conflict in Gaza since opting to include Israel in the competition as usual.\n\nBritish representative Olly Alexander was one of nine entrants to sign a statement in March which read: 'In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent.\n\n'It it important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages. We stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and islamophobia.\n\n'We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.\n\n'We feel it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.'\n\nThe Years & Years star had been under scrutiny as a group of 450 queer artists, individuals and organisations signed an open letter asking the singer to withdraw from the contest over Israel's war with Gaza.\n\n(L-R) Foureira, Chanel and Saade - without the keffiyeh - during a rehearsal of the semi-final\n\nBritish representative Olly Alexander (pictured) was one of nine entrants to sign a statement in March which read: 'In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent'\n\nHe also performed in Tuesday's semi-final, despite automatically qualifying for Saturday's showpiece\n\nIn an individual statement he wrote: 'I wholeheartedly support action being taken to demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the return of all hostages and the safety and security of all civilians in Palestine and Israel.\n\n'I know some people will choose to boycott this year's Eurovision and I understand and respect their decision.\n\n'As a participant I've taken a lot of time to deliberate over what to do and the options available to me. It is my current belief that removing myself from the contest wouldn't bring us any closer to our shared goal.'\n\n'I hope and pray that our calls are answered and there is an end to the atrocities we are seeing taking place in Gaza.\n\n'I'd like to thank the many signatories of this letter whose work I deeply admire and respect and hope that we can continue to work together in creating a better

Its rules state that political statements or even slogans are not allowed.\n\nBut the event \"has always been politically charged\", said Bloomberg, \"and this year perhaps more so than ever\".\n\nAhead of Saturday's Eurovision grand finale, 100,000 visitors are expected to descend on Malmo in Sweden. The host city has a sizeable Muslim minority and many of those heading there will be taking part in protests against Israel's war in Gaza. Organisers say the demonstrations are intended to be peaceful.\n\nMeanwhile, the song contest itself has for months been \"on the defensive about Israel's participation\", said Bloomberg.\n\nJanne Heltberg, a Norwegian actor and one of the initiators of EurovisiOFF, a campaign calling for a Eurovision boycott, has argued that just as Russia was swiftly banned after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Israel should now be disqualified.\n\nThis \"almost happened\" earlier this year, said DW, \"but not as a direct reaction to the boycott calls\". According to the EBU, the original title of the Israeli entry, \"October Rain\", by 20-year-old Eden Golan was too reminiscent of the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people and saw hundreds more taken hostage.\n\nDespite calls to exclude Israel from the competition, in the end the title was changed, and Golan was allowed to participate.\n\nWhile a majority of people asked by YouGov said Israel should not be allowed to compete, \"the reasons why are often geographical rather than political\", said the polling firm. Those who actually intend to watch Eurovision were slightly more likely to say that Israel should be allowed in than not.\n\nFar from its stated reputation as a strictly \"non-political event\", wrote Jacqui Housden on the i news site, over the past 50 years Eurovision's stage has been a \"hotbed of controversies and political statements, from calls to recognise genocide, to hidden messages on referendums and more obvious messages about the Russian leader\".\n\nIn just the last 20 years, Georgia was excluded in 2009 following Russia's invasion for the song \"We Don't Wanna Put In\". Belarus was kicked out in 2021 after the contested re-election of authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko, which precipitated a national crackdown on political opposition, while Russia was excluded in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine, which went on to win the competition by a landslide.\n\nIsrael has been participating in Eurovision for over half a century, \"so it's not the first time the Middle East conflict has come into the spotlight at the event\", said DW.\n\nIn 1973, Israeli singer Ilanit performed amid tight security. In the wake of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre of 11 Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists, the singer was forced to wear a protective vest, audience members were not allowed to stand and photographers had to take pictures of the ceiling \"to prove that their cameras were not camouflaged firearms\".\n\nFast forward to the present day and \"several prominent, artist-led campaigns argue that recent decisions to exclude Russia and Belarus set a precedent, and that Israel should be banned for human-rights violations\", said The New York Times.\n\n\"Eurovision officials reject those comparisons,\" said the paper, \"but when Golan performs in Malmo, it seems certain that many voters will be thinking about more than just her singing.\"\n\nThere has certainly been \"intense debate in the run-up to the competition about the dividing lines between music, art and politics\", said Politico. But at least when it comes to the event itself host country Sweden is the \"archetypal safe pair of hands for Eurovision\".", "source": {"uri": "theweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Week"},

Hosting the show for a record-setting ninth time, the UK quite rightly had a pep in its own step, having beaten a bad run to finish second the previous year.\n\nFor once, even among the media elite here in London, Eurovision felt like a positive force and something everyone could get behind. Indeed they did - having attended close to a dozen contests in person I've never seen a whole city embrace its responsibility so fully. There was branding everywhere, countless side events and an enormous public Eurovision Village that was packed every day.\n\nWhen I first became The Drum's Semi-Official Eurovision Correspondent a decade ago, it was purely so I could write passive-aggressive articles on how ridiculous it was that the marketing community was ignoring a cultural and entertainment moment bigger than both Beyonce and the Super Bowl largely because it wasn't 'cool.'\n\nFast forward to 2023, and things felt entirely different - Diageo, Google, Booking, TikTok and others all proudly had their names on their contest and their presence felt in the Eurovision village itself. Mondelez International, who, with a bit of arm twisting from my good self, had first dipped its toes in the Eurovision water back in 2016, had the contest's logo emblazoned on special bars of Cadbury Dairy Milk and Philadelphia in stores.\n\nSo what do we know about this year's contest, set to take place on Saturday, May 11, with semi-final shows on Tuesday and Thursday that week?\n\nFrom a UK perspective, the BBC is still backing it big, with the semis airing on BBC One again for the second time ever and surrounding it with a range of TV and radio programming. In much of Europe, most notably Iceland where it attracts a high 90% audience share, Eurovision remains the biggest night of TV of the year.\n\nThe contest will be hosted in Malmo, Sweden, this year, after Loreen's triumphant return with the song 'Tatoo' last year. Almost too conveniently for some, this brings the contest back to Scandinavian soil exactly 50 years after ABBA triumphed with the song 'Waterloo'. While it has denied any participation of the band, you can expect at least to see the considerable tribute paid on stage and, who knows, perhaps their ABBAtars appearing on screen, if nothing else.\n\nEurovision makes a strong point of saying it is non-political and banning any songs with overtly political meaning, but the contest itself emerged directly as a way of getting European nations to better work together in the aftermath of the Second World War.\n\nIn the past, it's been the trigger for a coup in Portugal, upset many a right-wing politician with its LGBTQ+ inclusion, and, of course, in recent years, seen Ukraine triumph while Russia was banned. You'll find far better accounts of the politics involved elsewhere, but whether the organizers admit it or not, the inclusion of Israel in the contest this year casts a very heavy political shadow over proceedings.\n\nIt seems uniquely detrimental for all involved, including the singer selected to represent Israel this year, that the participation is going ahead. There have been calls for artists and broadcasters to boycott, and despite exceptionally high security, it is highly likely to attract protests in many forms. In some corners of the fan community, it is being seen as an irreparable act of vandalism against the contest's reputation and newly permanent 'United By Music' slogan.\n\nI'm sure most advertisers weren't imagining that as a consideration when they negotiated or extended their partnerships last year, and for the most part, I imagine the casual viewer will enjoy the show very much as normal - and indeed as a reminder that casual audience was 162 million across all live shows in 2023, substantially more than the Super Bowl.\n\nMany of the same advertisers are back this year - headline sponsors Morocanoil, entertainment partners TikTok, and Diageo's Bailey's brand chief among them. While Mondelez and Booking haven't returned, the latter's travel sector is still well represented, with EasyJet and Royal Caribbean stepping in as official airline and cruise companies. Southern European real estate agents/property search company Idealista also returned as a sponsor for the third year.\n\nAlthough true fans understand Eurovision to be a six-month-long season starting with the earliest announcements and song selections at the end of the previous year, for most people, it's just one or two nights of good TV. That's always been one of the challenges of sponsoring the event, and why we'll also have to wait right until the last minute to see how brands are truly bringing their sponsorship to life this year. Stay tuned for what I discover online and on the ground in Sweden.", "source": {"uri": "thedrum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The war started on October 7 when Hamas militant group invaded Israel which resulted in the death of 1,200 people.\n\nWriting on Facebook, a Dreadnough pub co-owner said: \"A number of folk have contacted me and patiently explained why we shouldn't be broadcasting Eurovision this year. I get it.\n\n\"We show Eurovision every year because it's unifying, joyful and daft. It's not going to have that vibe this year, so we'll find something else to do instead.\"\n\nThey added: \"Here's hoping we'll be able to enjoy it, collectively, next year.\"\n\nSeveral regulars to the Leith pub commended the decision with one writing 'that's why you are the respected and loved bar that you are' with another adding 'I think this is the right call. I hope other places follow suit.'\n\nOne said they were boycotting the competition this year despite being a 'massive fan' adding 'human rights violations and war crimes can't be disguised with glitter and a song.\" Another added: \"You have the courage of your convictions in spite of the commercial pressure this can bring, that's why I love the Dreadnought Leith.\"\n\nIn the lead up to Eurovision 2024 people across Europe have protested the event calling for Israel to be withdrawn from the competition - with critics citing that the competition previously banned Russia in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier in the year, campaign group Palestine Solidarity UK launched a petition urging Olly Alexander, the UK's Eurovision contestant, to boycott the competition final that takes place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden on May 11.\n\nThe group, who say the petition has amassed more than 11,000 signatures wrote on social media: \"Palestinians have called for a boycott of this year's Eurovision Song Contest because of the refusal of its organisers to expel genocidal and apartheid Israel from the competition. Participation in Eurovision provides Israel a platform to artwash its ongoing genocide.\"", "source": {"uri": "edinburghnews.scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Edinburgh Evening News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leith", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leith"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leith"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Contests", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjY5ZjVjZWFjLTNmMWItNDI3Yi05NmM4LTYzYjNhZTY1ZTQ5MzpkYjA4YTdmOC0wNTI1LTQ5ZDktYTcxYi1iZTljNjkzMGEzYWU=.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 648, "textEnd": 657}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 2174, "textEnd": 2180}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Bambie Thug breaks that spell with \"Doomsday Blue,\" a self-described \"electro-metal breakdown.\" Thug (real name: Bambie Ray Robinson) is the first nonbinary artist to represent Ireland in Eurovision and will be the first Irish contestant in the competition since Ryan O'Shaugnessy placed 16th with \"Together\" in 2018.\n\nThug's entry is expected to place high in the grand final rankings. If they end up in the top five, it will be Ireland's biggest Eurovision success since Marc Roberts' \"Mysterious Ways,\" which finished second to Katrina & the Waves winning U.K. entry \"Love Shine a Light\" in 1997.\n\nTalia, an Israeli-born singer living in Luxembourg, will be the first person from that small European country -- the only grand duchy (a country ruled by a monarch with the title of grand duke or duchess) remaining in the world -- to sing in Eurovision since Modern Times placed 20th with \"Donne-Moi Une Chance\" in 1993.\n\nThe other eight countries that qualified for the grand final are Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Lithuania, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Ukraine. The five countries relegated out, by public vote during the live broadcast, are Australia, Azerbaijan, Iceland, Moldova and Poland.\n\nThe oddsmakers have Croatia heavily tipped to win; it would be that nation's first victory in 30 attempts, although Riva, a band from Croatia, triumphed in 1990 when their country was still part of Yugoslavia.\n\nA second semifinal will be broadcast live on Thursday (May 9). There will be 16 countries fighting for a spot in the grand final top 10 that night: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Israel, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland.\n\nPre-qualified, and thus able to skip the semifinals, are the host country (Sweden) and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), so-named because they contribute the largest amounts to the production budget.\n\nSemifinal No 2 of the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest will be live on Peacock in the U.S. on Thursday starting at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT.

Groups with provactive styles and appalling content aren't even trying to contribute to music; they're just shocking for the sake of shock.\n\n'This isn't talent, it's absurdity, which repels.'\n\nAnother complained: 'Olly Alexander's performance was much too raunchy. It needs to be toned down a lot.'\n\nThe routine, which is guaranteed to be in Saturday's final, sees the singer don a distressed vest and red trousers and a colour-coordinated jock strap over the top.\n\nDuring the performance, Olly sensually runs his hands over the dancer's shirtless bodies before they thrust to the beat of the song together.\n\nThings began to go pear-shaped during a performance this week when his microphone pack slipped from his trousers forcing him to conntinue the song while attempting to grab the pack which dangled underneath, no doubt contributing to the 'shaky' vocals some fans complained about.\n\nNoting the uncomfortable of the performance, one fan mused: 'It seems like some Eurovision fans are worried about Olly Alexander's vocals after his live performance of the UK entry.\n\n'The addition of shirtless dancers and raunchy moves may have distracted from his singing abilities. Hopefully he can work on improving his vocals before the competition.'\n\nEurovision fans have blasted the 2024 competition for being a 'provocative' and 'raunchy' x Factor rip off\n\nSlovenia's Raiven, who performs her track Veronika in an almost see through gown was also criticised online for her choice of attire.\n\nOne distressed fan said: 'Slovenia needs to really up their costume. Raiven please get better clothes.\n\n'Dress up for a family friendly show. Eurovision management do your job. Participants need to dress appropriately.'\n\nOther fans have accused the competition of overtly mimicking the X Factor in its presentation of acts, and suggested it is a bid to keep hold of the Gen Z crowd.\n\nThe competition has already been mired in controversy this year due to the inclusion of Israel, with some pro-Palestinians adamant they should not be invited due to their ongoing actions in the Gaza strip.\n\nEurovision organisers rebuked one of the Eurovision 2024 opening acts for wearing a keffiyeh during the first semi-final last night.\n\nSwedish singer Eric Saade, who was one of three former contestants opening the contest in Malmo, tied the scarf - which has become a symbol of support for Palestine amid the conflict in the Middle East - around his wrist.\n\nSaade, who is of Palestinian origin, came third for Sweden at the 56th Eurovision Song Contest in 2011 and has repeatedly expressed his opposition to Israel's involvement this time around.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, said: 'The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show.\n\n'All performers are made aware of the rules of the Contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.'\n\nSwedish singer Eric Saade has been rebuked by Eurovision organisers for wearing a keffiyeh while opening the first semi-final\n\nThe scarf which was tied round his wrist has become a symbol of support for Palestine amid the conflict in the Middle East\n\nSaade was joined by Eleni Foureira (left) and Chanel (centre) to open the event in Malmo, Sweden\n\nSaade was joined by fellow song contest alums Eleni Foureira, who came second in 2018 for Cyprus, and Chanel, who finished third for Spain in 2022, when he appeared with the keffiyeh wrapped around his wrist in clear view.\n\nIt is not the only difficulty the event has faced regarding the conflict in Gaza since opting to include Israel in the competition as usual.\n\nBritish representative Olly Alexander was one of nine entrants to sign a statement in March which read: 'In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent.\n\n'It it important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages.

The Rio Cinema will have its doors closed in Dalston, as will The Royal Vauxhall Tavern (RVT) in South West London.\n\nThe independent cinema isn't showing the contest as Israel remains in the competition, a demonstration of solidarity with the victims of the Gaza genocide. in January, charity Oxfam reported that Israel kills around 250 Palestinians every day, a daily death rate higher than any other 21st-century conflict, according to the charity.\n\nWith an average age of 18, around 13,000 children have died at the hands of Israel since October 7 last year, reported Reuters in March. As a result, The Rio Cinema in Dalston shared a statement on its position on the conflict.\n\nREAD MORE: Joanna Lumley chosen to announce UK's Eurovision points\n\nThe statement reads: \"Following discussion with the organisers of Eurovision Party London, we have collectively decided not to screen the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest. We firmly believe that the Eurovision Song Contest has the power to bring people together across the world when its core values of inclusivity, equality and universality are upheld.\n\n\"We will continue to organise fundraising events for the charities we support, including Doctors Without Borders and Medical Aid for Palestine.\"\n\nThe RVT will also have its doors closed this weekend, although it hasn't specified why. A tweet read: \"Royal Vauxhall Tavern will not be open for any event on Saturday night 11th May 2024.\" This follows backlash on social media for a Eurovision event it had planned.\n\nThe RVT was contacted for comment.\n\nDo you know any other venues cancelling Eurovision events?

Either the new season of Doctor Who is a lot wilder than anyone expected or it's the Eurovision Song Contest (it's the Eurovision Song Contest).\n\nAhead of the first semi-final on May 7, broadcast at 8pm on BBC One, we count down the 37 entries - which, as ever, run from sublime to ridiculous and all the way back again.\n\nBookies favourite Marko Puri\u0161i&cacute; - you'll be shocked to learn Baby Lasagna is a stage name - brings the fun to Eurovision with a rock-techno crossover in which the narrator gives up a life of milking cows on the farm and sets their heart on rock'n'roll success. It's fun but low-key political, too - Puri\u0161i&cacute; explains that the lyrics are about the mass youth emigration from Croatia and the consequent brain drain.\n\nSecond favourite according to the bookmakers and a song that stands immediately out from the pack. Nemo - a non-binary, rapper, singer and violinist - combines Freddie Mercury-style operatics, gothic piano and decent lyrics by Eurovision standards (\"I went to hell and back to get myself on track\"). It's great and could be a winner.\n\nWho's the daddy? Not Europapa singer Klein whose \"happy hardcore\" banger isn't all that bothered about setting dance-floors ablaze. The lyrics are actually about the death of his parents while he was a child and the lifelong shadow cast by grief.\n\nSinging in Italian, singer-songwriter Mango delivers a decent impersonation of Shakira doing battle with an aggressive acoustic guitar. It's great fun with a zinging sense of irreverence - but does it have that Eurovision oomph? Yes, say the bookmakers who have marked it out as a frontrunner.\n\nGiven what's happening in Ukraine, it's no surprise the country has not arrived at Malm\u00f6 with a party tune. Instead, it's an intense ballad addressed to Mother Theresa and the Virgin Mary, full of the pain you can only know if you've experienced war firsthand.\n\nAlbania hits Eurovision at full pelt with a big, buoyant euro-bopper. Besa is the daughter of a prominent millionaire and spent some of her childhood in London. Not that this has any bearing on Titan, an Ariana Grande-style power ballad that mooches along before kicking off properly in its final minute.\n\nThe Caucuses meet Latin America in this explosive mash-up of influences from a French-Arminian duo who started out on the Paris jazz scene. The title references singer Jaklin Baghdasaryan's nickname and celebrates artistic freedom and self-confidence. \"Growing up I have always been told that girls should behave, be humble, dress normally, not talk too much, not do crazy things,\" she said.\n\nHuge house beats and wispy vocals collide on an energetic song - but is it too generically Eurovision? And why does it sound a bit like Lady Gaga's Bad Romance meets Fat of the Land-era Prodigy?\n\nDance duo One Milkali created history by incorporating Yankunytjatjara, one of the languages of Australia's First Peoples, into their entry. It's a shame they didn't bring the same spirit of innovation to a listless dancefloor workout.\n\nSinger Ilkin Dovlatov uses traditional Azeri lyrics for the chorus but otherwise, this sounds like a 10-year-old Justin Timberlake b-side. There is a lot of howling - one of those recent Eurovision trends that seems set to stick around for a while longer.\n\nHercules and Love Affair meets Harry Styles and Troye Sivan on a bittersweet party anthem that asks, \"Are we sure the kids are alright or just playing it cool?\". The boring answer is that the kids probably spend too long on TikTok, but that doesn't bother Mustii, who dashes towards a crashing chorus.\n\nEurovision wouldn't be Eurovision without a cut-and-paste Britney Spears homage with wonky lyrics, and that's what Silia Kapsis delivers with the Liar (\"I'm feeling like ooh-la-la\"). It's got energy, however - and a compelling performance in the semi-finals could get it over the line.\n\nA few years ago at Eurovision, you couldn't swing a tiny flag without hitting another Billie Eilish clone. Now, every second artist reminds you of Olivia Rodrigo's Good 4 U. A case in point is Czech's Aiko, whose song Pedestal was co-written by Steve Ansell of landfill indie stalwarts Blood Red Shoes.\n\nYou can't go wrong with a house piano intro - yet Saba (a sometime actress and the first black queer woman to represent Denmark) almost manages to ruin the fun with this dull Dua Lipa-style dance workout.\n\nWhy send one entrant when you can submit two? That's Estonia's big idea for this mash-up between hip-hop crew 5MIINUST and lyre-playing techno group Puuluup. The lyrics are about a narcotics bust and translate as: \"We don't really know anything about these drugs\". We don't really know anything about them making the final, either.\n\nHow wacky do you like your Eurovision? If the answer is lots, you'll appreciate this \"zany\" Euro-pop belter that sounds like Right Said Fred meets Faithless. The live performance features exploding trousers - which is just as well because, without the pyrotechnics, the song is pure pants. Window95Man isn't the singer's real name, you'll be stunned to hear. By day, Teemu Keisteri is a visual artist known for his witty, subversive imagery. They've only packed the Finnish Banksy off to Eurovision.\n\nA French Eurovision entry called Mon Amour could only ever be one thing: a tepid piano ballad with a string section so rich you can feel your cholesterol shoot up while listening. Slimane won series five of The Voice France and has released four chart-topping LPs.\n\nNo stranger to a big occasion, Buzaladze performed on American Idol 2023, where she duetted with Kylie Minogue. After that, Eurovision is almost a comedown - and she should be so lucky to reach the final with a catchy yet unremarkable chunk of mid-tempo pop.\n\nHaving flopped badly at recent Eurovisions, Germany has come up with the clever solution of sending a song that sounds like Eye of the Tiger by Survivor. Risin' up, back on the street they may be, but can Germany improve on 2023's humiliating last-place finish? Isaak seems up for the challenge. Then, when your career highlights include belting out Wonderwall on X Factor Germany, as he did in 2011, the only way is up.\n\nIt's all happening on Satti's perky blend of reggaeton, Euro-grooves, and - well, we've all been waiting for one - a solo on an ancient Persian pipe called the Zurna.\n\nNo relation to the former Sugarcubes singer, the Icelandic entry delivers a traditional hair-dryer belter that hits like Bonnie Tyler for Generation TikTok. It's not necessarily a bad idea, but Hera never convinces you that it's a good one either. It's her second Eurovision, following on from a 19th place finish in Oslo in 2010.\n\nIt's already been a big year for Cork, with Cillian Murphy winning the Oscar for Best Actor. Can Bambie Thug, from the market town of Macroom, equal that success with their \"Ouija pop\" epic Doomsday Blue? Shrieking hellishly and cavorting with demonic forces is a bit of a departure for Eurovision - but not for Ireland, which has sent Jedward on two separate occasions.\n\nRegardless of the quality of Golan's performance in Thursday's second semi-final, it will be overshadowed by controversy over Israel's participation in the contest. She's already been forced to change the name of her lush power ballad after its original title, October Rain, was interpreted as referencing the Hamas attack on October 7, thus breaching the EBU's no politics rule.\n\nThe influence of Olly Murs has reached the Baltics via a generic man-ballad from a former DJ and reality TV star who, when living in London, went by the stage-name \"Art Singer\".\n\nOne of those by-the-numbers Eurovision tunes that seems to erase itself from your memory even as you listen. It has a middle-of-the-road tempo and trite lyrics about putting on a sunny face to the outside world. Belt is a graduate of the University of Westminster and placed sixth in X Factor Lithuania. He'll do well to match that performance in Sweden.\n\nLuxembourg is staging a spectacular Eurovision comeback as the five-time winner returns for the first time in 31 years. It's a plucky return, featuring expressive French-language vocals, a twitchy guitar hook and a nice \"hahah-oh-haah\" chorus.\n\nOne of the smaller Eurovision nations, Malta has always acquitted itself respectably (though it hasn't reached the final since 2016). Alas, it's at the back of the back with this listless Euro-thumper, which sounds like something you might have encountered on a sun holiday but which evaporated along with your hangover. Bonnici is the daughter of a prominent Maltese businessman and was previously a dancer at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nBarbu scores a full house of Eurovision bingo - an Arabic-style chorus, swooning strings and hollow lyrics (\"raise your wings... don't be afraid\"). It's a second Eurovision for the artist, who also represented Moldova in 2007.\n\nPagan popsters Heilung are an audible influence on \"progressive folk\" outfit G\u00e5te, whose song tells the tale of a young woman banished to the woods where she goes wild. Despite the gory subject, the tune is surprisingly mannered - and will do well to reach the final.\n\nWith its \"Alone, alone, alone...\" chorus and wonky beats, Luna does her best Dua Lipa impersonation. Whether that's enough to woo voters remains to be seen. Naming Bj\u00f6rk as an influence, she promises her performance will be a \"fairy tale\".\n\nA graduate of the songwriting program at BIMM Sussex, Iolanda Costa is a former contestant on The Voice Portugal. \"Grito\" translates to shout, but it's a tender ballad that rarely raises its voice, which may be a problem when it comes to wooing voters.\n\nThe Italian-speaking micro-state will never better the year it sent rapper Flo Rida. This year, rock band Megara - actually from Madrid - stakes their hopes on a 90s-esque pop banger that sounds like a distant cousin of the Spice Girls' Spice Up Your Life with bonus guitars. It's Megara's third rodeo, following two unsuccessful bids to represent Spain in the contest.\n\nA song that wears its politics on its sleeve - but that's okay because the context is historical rather than contemporary. The title refers to the Ramonda flower Serbians wear in remembrance of those who died in World War I. It's a big, blustering ballad delivered to perfection by Dora, who had a big TikTok hit last year with D&zcaron;anum.\n\nThe spirit of Florence and the Machine stalks Raiven's pile-driver weepie - though the song surprises in the final 30 seconds by turning into a heavy metal Taylor Swift. It won't win, but her shrieking fade-out certainly sets it apart from the pack. It isn't the 28 year-old's first Eurovision experience: she placed second in Slovenia's national contests in 2016 and 2019.\n\nThere's been controversy in Spain over \"Zorra\", which can be translated as either \"vixen\" or \"bitch\", and is regarded by some as a sexist slur. His'n'Hers duo Nebulossa say they are reclaiming the word and have chosen to storm the barricades via a perky electro bopper that sounds like the Pet Shop Boys's lost Balearic album.\n\nSweden is going for a record-breaking eight-win. However, identical twins Marcus & Martinus - actually from Norway - play it safe with a squelchy electro ditty that lands like a Troye Sivan b-side. Pre-Eurovision their claim to notoriety was winning Sweden's version of Masked Singer.\n\nPoor Olly Alexander. Until last year, he'd been outstanding in everything he had done, whether fronting early Years & Years or delivering a searing lead performance in Russell T Davies's AIDs-era drama It's A Sin.\n\nSadly, Dizzy - a soggy mash-up of Pet Shop Boys and Gloria Gaynor - just can't get off the ground, though his inventive sci-fi staging may help Alexander belatedly achieve lift-off at Saturday's grand final.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type":

It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nHe also noted the EBU, an apolitical member organisation, is \"in line\" with other international federations including sports bodies who are allowing Israel to participate in events.\n\nFoDiscussing the backlash, De Tender said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan, which is the Israeli public broadcaster, met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\nIn 2022, EBU announced that Russia would no longer be participating in Eurovision following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA statement at the time said the EBU's executive board had made the decision following a recommendation by the Eurovision governing body, known as the reference group, based on \"the rules of the event and the values of the EBU\".\n\nDe Tender also said the situation between Russia and Israel was \"different\" as in Russia's case there was a \"broad consensus within the membership of the EBU that they could not participate\".\n\nHe added that the three Russian members of the EBU had already been \"excluded\" from the EBU membership in the weeks after the war broke out due to breaching \"member obligations\".\n\nThe 37 Eurovision entries are set to perform across two semi-finals next week on Tuesday and Thursday in a bid to compete for a place in the grand final on Saturday.\n\nAlexander is set to perform his dance-infused track Dizzy on behalf of the UK during the Tuesday semi-final, but he is already through to the final along with the other members of the \"big five\" - France, Germany, Italy and Spain - as well as last year's winner Sweden, who get to go through automatically.\n\nDe Tender said the preparations are going \"very well\" as they have been planning the music spectacle in Sweden for the past year after Loreen won the competition with her hit song Tattoo.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naomi_clarke@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Naomi Clarke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8201/4100605_1_articlelarge_2.72160269.jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Three iconic figures of the festival, Chanel Terrero, Eleni Foureira and Eric Saade, have come together to start the first semi-final. This joint performance, which served to bring back the Spanish singer, has not been without controversy.\n\nThe Swede Eric Saade, known for his participation in 2011 and of Palestinian origin, took advantage of his performance with Popular to express his support for Palestine, whose historical conflict with Israel - which will participate in the Festival - has worsened in recent months.\n\nAt the beginning of his musical number, Saade showed off a kufiya on his wrist, a recognized symbol of pro-Palestinian solidarity. This gesture was not a simple detail, but a clear political positioning in an event that has traditionally remained neutral with respect to geopolitical conflicts.\n\nIn fact, they had been warned before the start of Eurovision not to bring Palestinian flags or symbols to the M\u00e4lmo Arena, in addition to announcing very rigorous security controls. These measures sought to avoid the politicization of the event, which brings together participants from all over Europe and beyond.\n\nThe reaction was not long in coming.

But before the 26 acts can show off their skills in Saturday's final, most first have to go through one of the ESC semi-finals. And that's where viewers have a lot of power.\n\nThe two semi-finals take place tonight and Thursday. These will decide which countries make it through to the Grand Final on Saturday. There will be 15 acts in Tuesday's semi-final and 16 on Thursday. Twenty of these 31 acts will make it to Saturday, where they join the acts from six countries already pre-qualified. The shows will be carried live on RTL T\u00e9l\u00e9 L\u00ebtzebuerg, and in English through RTL Today, starting at 21.00.\n\nThe running order for the first semi-final is listed and includes favourites this year such as Croatia and Ukraine. Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden will also be showcased, though they automatically qualify for the final.\n\nGermany and the UK are among the \"Big Five\" countries in the competition - the biggest donors who are automatically in the final. Sweden is through to Saturday as this year's hosts because they won the trophy last year with Loreen.\n\nLuxembourg's 23-year-old Tali Golergant will be competing with her English and French pop song \"Fighter\", which won the national preliminary round, the Luxembourg Song Contest. The singer with Israeli-Peruvian roots will be the last of 15 participants performing on Tuesday, which is sometimes seen as a good thing as the audience will have her and her performance fresh in their minds when they turn to voting.\n\nThe interval act will include two-time Irish winner Johnny Logan.\n\nThe Luxembourg participant's chances are pretty good. Apart from the fact that more acts qualify for the final than are eliminated, she is also looking good according to the bookmakers. If you believe the Eurovisionworld portal, which summarises the betting odds of various providers, she had an 87% chance of qualifying (as of Monday). However, it is votes on the night that will count.\n\nFirst things first: the outcome of the two semi-finals of the Eurovision Song Contest is decided solely by the viewers at home. It is not possible to vote for the country you are in.\n\nHowever, you can vote for any of the other countries taking part in the same semi-final as Luxembourg. People in the three countries performing that pre-qualified for the grand final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom - are also eligible to vote tonight.\n\nThe rest of the world also is entitled to vote in all three shows. These are the countries that are not taking part in the ESC, and all those votes are added together and counted as one additional 'country' taking part.\n\nIn the semi-finals, voting will open after the last song and remain open for around 15 to 25 minutes. You can vote either via the official Eurovision Song Contest app or via its website. Those who vote via the app will receive a special video message from their favourite artists.\n\nVoting involves a \u20ac0.99 charge, including VAT or sales tax, paid by bank card. You can vote up to 20 times for the countries you want to support.", "source": {"uri": "luxtimes.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Luxembourg Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luxembourg"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Luxembourg"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTL_T\u00e9l\u00e9_L\u00ebtzebuerg", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RTL T\u00e9l\u00e9 L\u00ebtzebuerg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTL_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RTL Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Logan_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Logan (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://img.wort.lu/public/luxemburg/hj2kno-tali-rehearsing-fighter-for-luxembourg-at-the-first-rehearsal-of-the-first-semi-final-at-malmo-arena5.jpg/alternates/BASE_SIXTEEN_NINE/TALI_rehearsing_Fighter_for_Luxembourg_at_the_First_Rehearsal_of_the_First_Semi-Final_at_Malmo_Arena5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Starting in 2012, the singer made up one-third of the U.K. pop group Years & Years, garnering critical acclaim and a massive audience over the course of nearly a decade.\n\nBut in 2024, Alexander is ready to truly reintroduce himself, this time as himself. \"I loved being in Years & Years and I loved the journey that we all went on. But it just felt like this was the time to really put that all in the past and move on,\" he tells Billboard. \"It was kind of scary, but that's always a good thing, I think, to be a little challenged by what's ahead.\"\n\nAt the outset of the year, Alexander released his first single under his own name since the group became his solo project in 2019. On first listen, \"Dizzy\" feels like a natural progression for the 33-year-old singer-songwriter's sound, boasting a modernized, electro-pop melody that flows like a retrofitted, unreleased deep cut from the '80s. But \"Dizzy\" is much more than just a continuation for Alexander -- it's an opportunity to reintroduce himself to a hundreds of millions of new listeners.\n\nAlong with its role as Alexander's first release under his own name, \"Dizzy\" also serves as the United Kingdom's official entry in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. With the event's grand final set to take place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden on Saturday (May 11), Alexander will be one of 26 contestants vying for the competition's top spot. American fans wishing to tun in to the final can do so on Peacock, starting live at 3:00 p.m. ET on Saturday -- they can also cast their votes on Eurovision's official voting website.\n\nFor Alexander, performing at the decades-long song contest is a dream come true. \"I've loved Eurovision since I was a kid,\" he says. \"It feels like it's just growing all the time with younger audiences, and I feel like it's just such an amazing opportunity for any artist.\"\n\nThe singer says he's known he wanted to participate in Eurovision for \"a few years now,\" but that 2024 provided an unmissable opportunity for him as an artist. \"I was working on a lot of new music about a year ago, and my producer Danny L Harle was like, 'Wouldn't it be great if one of the new songs we're making could be taken to Eurovision?'\" he recounts. \"So we just sent a few of the songs to the U.K. Eurovision selection team, and everyone really loved 'Dizzy.'\"\n\nIf there were a checklist for what you expect to hear in a winning Eurovision song, \"Dizzy\" would tick off nearly every box. The song, written by Alexander and Harle and produced by Harle and Finn Keane, offers an upbeat tempo, glittering synths, instantly memorable vocals and a clear aesthetic vision, as Alexander revels in the bewildering stages of early romance.\n\n\"It is probably the best, easiest time I've had making music,\" Alexander explains of the song. \"It felt very harmonious in the studio, because I think Danny and I share a love of a lot of the same references -- we were drawing inspiration from a book of medieval poems, from Greek tragedies, from all over. It was such a liberating time spent together.\"\n\nWith his first performance at Tuesday's semi-final (May 7), Alexander proved that the time in the studio was well-spent. Taking to the stage at Malm\u00f6 Arena, the singer and four scantily-clad backup dancers confined themselves to a small set designed after a grungy locker room. With well-timed camera tricks and some creative positioning from Alexander and his dancers, audiences watched the room spin and shift its gravity constantly, giving credence to the song's vertiginous title.\n\nIt's a memorable performance for the UK, which in recent years has seen its fortunes in the annual competition dwindle. While the country has won Eurovision five times and placed second a record 16 times, their last win came in 1997, with Katrina and the Waves' \"Love Shine a Light.\" In 2022, Sam Ryder became the first contestant from the U.K. to earn second place since 1998, while 2023's entrant Mae Muller finished second-to-last in the final.\n\nWhile Alexander and the U.K. are not currently favored to win this year's competition -- betting odds currently give \"Dizzy\" a 1% chance at the top prize -- the singer says that the beauty of Eurovision lies in its unpredictability. \"There was obviously this long period where the U.K., frankly, had its feelings hurt a little bit by not doing very well,\" Alexander chuckles. \"But with all this new attention for Eurovision, it's become a situation where it feels like anything could happen. Things could change in a moment.\"\n\nAlexander is referring to Gen Z, and their unabashed love for the event as a campy, dramatic spectacle. Especially after acts like M\u00e5neskin and Duncan Laurence earned massive virality on TikTok thanks to their performances, Alexander remarks that success at Eurovision in 2024 looks much different than in its nascent years. \"The level of awareness has really been raised by the TikTok generation,\" he says. \"It's breathed a bit of new life into the contest.\"\n\nThat awareness among younger generations is also bolstered by the contest's track record of supporting LGBTQ+ voices long before it was popular to do so -- past winners including Dana International, Conchita Wurst, Duncan Laurence and Loreen all identify as LGBTQ, which Alexander says isn't a coincidence. \"Yes, Eurovision is an ultimate celebration of joy. But it also just celebrates people for who they are, and can often feel like a safe space in that way,\" Alexander explains. \"People can really wear their hearts on their sleeves with these massive performances.\"\n\nPart of Eurovision's appeal, Alexander points out, has long been the contest's seemingly \"apolitical\" approach -- founded in 1956, the original aim of the song contest was to bring Europeans together following the devastation of World War II. Today, the contest's permanent motto bears that same ideal: \"United in Music.\"\n\nYet even with its history of nonpartisanship, Eurovision 2024 finds itself mired in controversy. Israel is set to participate in the annual song competition, despite calls from around the world to bar the country from competing due to the ongoing war in Gaza. Many cited the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) 2022 decision to ban Russia from competing in Eurovision after the country invaded Ukraine as a precedent for removing Israel from the 2024 competition, but the EBU's director general Noel Curran made it clear in a January statement that Israel would be allowed to participate in the contest.\n\nBefore he was announced as an entrant in Eurovision, Alexander made his position on the continuing conflict clear -- in October 2023, the singer signed an open letter from Voices4 London, an LGBTQ+ activist group calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and referring to Israel as an \"apartheid regime.\" The letter opened the singer up to a wave of backlash, including an anonymous source for the UK's Conservative Party telling The Daily Telegraph that Alexander's selection as the country's representative at Eurovision was \"either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck from the BBC.\"\n\nSpeaking to Billboard in March, Alexander makes his feelings on the matter clear: \"[Israel's participation] is basically a decision that's not at all under my controI. All I hope and pray for is peace and an end to the fighting as soon as possible.\" As for his signature on the open letter, the singer says he doesn't regret speaking up. \"I wanted to express my solidarity with the people of Palestine. I support a ceasefire, and that was why I signed the letter.\"\n\nBut just one week after his Billboard interview, Alexander began receiving criticism from those supporting a ceasefire in Gaza. Queers for Palestine, an LGBTQ+ activist organization calling for an end to the ongoing attacks in Gaza, published an open letter signed by over 450 queer artists, activists and organizations in late March asking Alexander to boycott Eurovision. \"We share the vision of queer joy and abundance you've offered through your music, and share your belief in collective liberation for all,\" the group wrote. \"In this spirit, we ask you to heed the Palestinian call to withdraw from Eurovision ... There can be no party with a state committing apartheid and genocide.\"\n\nAlexander ultimately responded -- both in a personal message and in a message from multiple other contestants -- to the call in April, saying that he would not be boycotting the event, and instead using the platform provided by Eurovision to \"call for peace.\" In a documentary with the BBC titled Olly Alexander's Road to Eurovision '24 (originally aired Sunday, May 5), Alexander spoke at length about his internal conflict with the decision.\n\n\"The backdrop to this is actual, immense suffering. It's a humanitarian crisis, a war, and it just so happens that there's a song contest going on at the same time that I'm a part of,\" he explained through tears. \"People should do what's right for them -- if they want to boycott Eurovision, if they don't feel comfortable watching, that's their choice, and I respect that, you know? Eurovision is ... meant to be an apolitical contest, but that's, like, a fantasy.\"\n\nIn his conversation with Billboard, Alexander makes sure to point to the team of people surrounding him and their unyielding help. \"I told them that I was going to do this, that it was important for me to use my voice,\" he says. \"And they said that they would support me no matter what.\"\n\nRegardless of how Alexander places at Saturday's event (the U.K. automatically qualifies for the final as a member of the \"Big Five\" contributing countries), he remains assured that the path laid out before him can lead to even further success. The singer is currently plotting out his forthcoming new album (executive produced by Harle), which he describes as \"very cohesive, and pulled very much from the '80s, but also veering into '90s pop.\"\n\nWith a list of past collaborators including Elton John, the Pet Shop Boys and Kylie Minogue, the singer says he's learned plenty about what it means to find success in the music business while still remaining true to who he is. \"It was nice to understand that you can have a long career, be at the top of your game, and still be a genuinely decent person,\" he explains. \"To have the insane legendary careers that all of them have had ... there's a reason that all of them are still at the top of their game; they're so easy to work with.\"\n\nHe's also keeping an eye on his acting career -- after starring in Russel T Davies' critically acclaimed period drama It's a Sin and earning career-first nominations at ceremonies like the Critics' Choice Awards and the National Television Awards, Alexander says he's open to continuing to act.\n\nBut most of all, Alexander says that win or lose, Eurovision provides him with an opportunity to present his most authentic self to the world at large. \"It was right to start this new chapter and do Eurovision all under my own name,\" he says. \"It really did feel like it's now or never.\"", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType":

It started on May 7, with the final taking place this Saturday, May 11.\n\nBritain's representative this year is 33-year-old singer and actor Olly Alexander. Star of It's A Sin and the lead singer of Years & Years, his entry - a thumping bassline electro feverdream, Dizzy - is exactly the sort of thing which Eurovision specialises in. It's camp, catchy and, looked at for more than three seconds, as flimsy as a feather boa on the breeze. Dynamite.\n\nFind out whether the judges in Malm\u00f6 feel the same way by turning into the Grand Final on Saturday May 11, which will be broadcast live 8pm on BBC One. Representing the host nation of Sweden, the event will be MC'ed by Hollywood actress Malin \u00c5kerman (best known for Watchman), who is joined by comedian and Eurovision regular Petra Mede. And, as usual, Graham Norton will be on hand for eyebrows-raised presenting duties. This year, Joanna Lumley will be UK's spokesperson.\n\nBut what happens when the lights fade out? Life as someone who \"once made a t__ of themselves on Eurovision\" can be a bleak place. (Just ask Jemini.) So from the famous to the infamous, it's time to look back at what happened next to all the British acts who've graced the Eurovision stage.\n\n\"All the golden dreams of yesterday,\" crooned Patricia Bredin, the young actress and amateur opera singer from Hull who became Britain's first ever Eurovision contestant, when we joined the contest for its second year. (We would skip the next one, too.) At a nifty one minute and 52 seconds, All remains the UK's shortest Eurovision entry.\n\nBorn in 1935, Bredin went on to appear in several films alongside Sid James and Ian Carmichael, before taking over from Julie Andrews as Guenevere in a Broadway production of Camelot with Richard Burton. She then emigrated to Canada and took to raising cattle.\n\nShe was still performing as recently as 2007, and looked back at her Eurovision appearance fondly, although she was a bit baffled when she was first approached to take part in the contest. She had never watched TV before, and wasn't sure what it involved. \"Television? I'd never heard of it! I didn't know what they were talking about,\" she recalled in 2016. Bredin died on August 13, 2023, aged 88.\n\nVery much the Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z of their day, Carr & Johnson were both popular and independently successful singers before their marriage in 1955. They arrived on Eurovision at the peak of their fame, which clearly helped: they placed second in that year's contest.\n\nAfter Eurovision, Johnson went on work as a Radio 2 DJ, and appeared in the TV children's programme Crackerjack. In 1987, the couple starred together in a West End revival of Stephen Sondheim's musical Follies. For many years, they lived together in Brinsworth House, an actors' and artists' retirement home in Twickenham. Teddy Johnson died in June 2018, and Pearl Carr followed in February 2020. They were both 98.\n\nOur 1959 contestant Teddy Johnson had auditioned to represent the UK again in 1960, but found himself pipped to the post by his own brother, Bryan, an out-of-work actor. Like Teddy the year before, Bryan finished in second place.\n\nBetter known for his stage roles than his singing, Johnson gave several acclaimed performances in Shakespearean productions, taking comic roles alongside the famous (and famously histrionic) actor-director Sir Donald Wolfit. Recalling his part in Wolfit's King Lear, the impresario called Johnson \"the best Fool I ever had\". He died in 1995.\n\nDespite being unrelated (their real names were John Alford and Bob Day), \"John and Bob Allison\" were marketed as Britain's answer to the Everly Brothers, a pair of clean-cut crooning siblings. They came in second place at Eurovision with a distinguished 24 points, and Are You Sure? became a minor hit. The pair climbed back into the top 40 singles chart the following year with Lessons in Love, but disbanded in 1963, making only a few reunion appearances. They gave their last concert together in 2012; Bob Day died a year later.\n\nThe Belfast-born plumber's son Ronnie Carroll is the only singer to have represented the UK for two straight years, reaching fourth place both times.\n\nHe went on to make a living performing on luxury cruise ships including the QE2, and released a comeback album, Back on Song, in 2005. He went bankrupt twice; after the second time, he set up a food stall in Camden Market.\n\nMore surprisingly, Carroll brought his sense of humour and showbiz to the world of British politics. He stood for as a candidate for the tiny Rainbow Alliance party in the 1997 General Election, and again in a 2008 by-election for the Make Politicians History party. That name proved horribly prophetic: when he tried his luck again in the 2015 general election, he died four days after nominations closed, but crucially before polling day. As a result, \"The Eurovisionary Carroll\" was a candidate on the ballot.\n\nAt the time of his Eurovision appearance, London singer Monro (nicknamed \"the man with the golden voice\") had already lent his vocal talents to a Bond movie, singing the theme tune for 1963's From Russia with Love.\n\nAfter placing second in Eurovision, he went on to sing the Oscar-winning title song for 1966 drama Born Free (about the life of Elsa the Lioness), and continued to record and perform until his death from liver cancer in 1985.\n\nOnce the highest-paid female singer of her generation, the Marilyn Monroe-esque Kirby brought a radical touch of Sixties spice to Eurovision in 1965, only to finish in second place behind a still more controversial song, Serge's Gainsbourg's edgy and satirical Poup\u00e9e de cire, poup\u00e9e de son, performed by Luxembourg's entry France Gall.\n\nPost-Eurovision, Kirby had two prime-time BBC television hits, The Kathy Kirby Show and Kathy Kirby Sings. She toured with stars including Cliff Richard and Tom Jones, and reportedly had an affair with Bruce Forsyth.\n\nBut after the death in 1971 of her manager and lover Bert Ambrose (42 years her senior), Kirby's career suffered. She was declared bankrupt in 1975, and, having been diagnosed with schizophrenia, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 1979. After being discharged, she moved in with a female fan called Laraine McKay, and caused a media storm when she announced they were planning to marry each other; the relationship came to an end when McKay was arrested and imprisoned for fraud.\n\nKirby retired from singing in 1983 after a glitzy farewell concert in Blackpool, and died in 2011.\n\nScottish pantomime star McKellar shocked Eurovision audiences by performing in a kilt (a last-minute costume decision). It went down badly: he placed ninth, Britain's worst result at the time.\n\nDespite his Euroflop, McKellar's eclectic singing career endured until the mid-Nineties, highlights including an acclaimed musical setting of Robert Burns's poems, and his popular recording of Song of the Clyde, used as the opening theme for 1963 film Billy Liar.\n\nMore surprisingly, he recorded an Afrikaans-language album in 1970, and wrote a comedy sketch that Monty Python performed at the Secret Policemen's Ball. He died in the USA in 2010, and was brought back home to be buried in Paisley.\n\nBritain's first Eurochamp was a likely winner from the outset; she'd already had a UK number one in 1964, and having also recorded her hit singles in French, Italian, German and Spanish, she was equally popular on the continent.\n\nBut she wasn't proud of her Eurovision-winning song. \"I hated it from the very first oompah to the final bang on the big bass drum,\" she once said. \"I was instinctively repelled by its sexist drivel and cuckoo-clock tune.\" Still, it didn't hamper her pop career, with further hits well into the Eighties (prompting fan-mail from The Smiths' Morrissey and Johnny Marr).\n\nSince the Nineties, however, Shaw has worked as a psychotherapist; she finally announced her complete retirement from music in 2013. In 2017, she received an MBE for services to music. She has also been a political campaigner: in 2012, she joined an Amnesty International push against human rights abuses in Azerbaijan, that year's host country; and she campaigned against Brexit in 2016.\n\nBorn Harry Webb in Lucknow, now Sir Cliff (OBE), the octogenarian is still going strong, having sold over 21 million singles in the UK across his half-century career. He did rather well at Eurovision, too, reaching second (1968) and third place (1973).\n\nHe has been a fixture of British cultural life ever since. In 2018, he released his first studio album of new material for 14 years, Rise Up, which dealt with his acrimonious legal battle with the BBC. (In 2014, Richard had been investigated as part of Operation Yewtree over allegations of historical sexual abuse, but he was never arrested for any offence. The BBC controversially broadcast a search of his home, and have since been forced to pay out substantial damages.)\n\nScottish pop supernova and TV personality Lulu won 1969's Eurovision in a four-way tie with Spain, France and the Netherlands.\n\nShe went on to score number one singles in the UK and America, and sang the theme for 1974 Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun. (That said, in America she's perhaps better known as the voice behind the chart-busting title theme for the 1967 film To Sir, With Love.)\n\nIn 2011 she took part in Strictly Come Dancing, and in 2014 sang at the closing ceremony for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. In 2018 she returned to the London stage in West End musical 42nd Street, and was a special guest on Take That's Greatest Hits Live tour. She was honoured with a CBE in 2021.\n\nWelsh folk singer Hopkin gave the UK another second place at Eurovision, after a string of hit singles including Goodbye (written and produced by Paul McCartney).\n\nAfter she married top producer Tony Visconti in 1971, she withdrew from the limelight, but still sang on several albums he produced, including David Bowie's Low. After a late-Seventies comeback, she joined a group called Oasis (not the Gallaghers' band), and sang on Vangelis's soundtrack for Blade Runner. .\n\nIn 2018, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of her break out single Those Were the Days, produced by Paul McCartney, Hopkin released a new acoustic version of the track. She is still recording, and released her last studio album in 2023 on her 73rd birthday with her daughter Jessica Lee Morgan\n\nYoung Northern Irish singer Clodagh Rodgers received death threats from the IRA when she agreed to represent the UK at the 1971 Eurovision, staged in Dublin. She took the stage nonetheless, and finished in a decent fourth place.\n\nShe only had one post-Eurovision chart single (Lady Love Bug, in late 1971), but continued a ropey recording career for several years, releasing her last new studio album in 1977. She would have better luck on stage, touring with the West End musical Blood Brothers in the Nineties before retiring from the music business in 2015.\n\nThe New Seekers were only tenuously linked to their Australian parent-group by original Seeker Keith Podger, who left the band before it brought Britain yet another second-place result with its saccharine harmonies. They disbanded in 1974, but have reappeared in various shifting incarnations over the years, most recently in a 2006 tour, which only featured one member of their Eurovision line-up (Paul Layton).\n\nAfter taking Britain to fourth place in Eurovision (beaten by ABBA's Waterloo), Newton-John was immortalised on the big screen as Sandy in 1978's Grease. She found further chart success with the soundtrack to Electric Light Orchestra musical Xanadu in 1980 (though the film itself was a flop) and solo recordings including I Honestly Love You and Physical. She won four Grammys and became one of the best-selling female artists of all time. Newton-John was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992 and became a passionate advocate for cancer research. She battled the disease three times before her death aged 73 in 2022.\n\nFormerly Cliff Richard's backing band, The Shadows were best known for instrumental hits such as Apache, but made an impressively laid-back foray into vocal harmonies for Eurovision, placing second (again!) despite obviously forgetting the words at one point.\n\nThe band went on to considerable worldwide success, and the then-current members were all offered OBEs in 2004 (though lead guitarist Hank Marvin declined his). They played their farewell tour in 2009. \"Everyone thinks screaming was invented with Beatlemania,\" the band told The Telegraph, \"but Cliff had his own mania.\"\n\nAfter winning Eurovision, the ABBA-esque Save Your Kisses for Me became the biggest-selling Eurovision winner to date, prompting a series of international tours, but the Brotherhood's hits dried up by the end of the decade. They have reunited sporadically since splitting up in 1984 but decided to retire from touring in 2022.\n\nBritain came second (yup, it's catching) with this jaunty honky-tonk duet, though after a few follow-up singles the pair went their separate ways. Afterwards, Moran became the producer of the long-running children's music TV show Get It Together, while de Paul (after a few pop releases) moved into classical music, releasing albums of Bach and Handel. In 1982, she starred with Ian McKellen, Joanna Lumley and Helen Mirren in a West End panto production of Cinderella.\n\nDe Paul also made a police-approved self-defence video, worked as OK! magazine's staff cartoonist, and once released a concept album of children's pop songs about the Channel Tunnel. She died in October 2014.\n\nOriginally called Mothers Pride and finishing in 11th place, Co-Co split up soon after their Eurovision humiliation, having only released one album. But their real importance is as a prelude: band member Cheryl Baker would be back just three years later with her new group, Bucks Fizz, and would win the competition.\n\nNovelty foursome Black Lace may have made little impact at Eurovision (placing seventh), but they would achieve undying notoriety five years later, when they released the hellishly catchy earworm Agadoo (once heralded by Q Magazine as The Worst Song of All Time, according to a panel of expert music writers). Another dubious career highlight came in 2003, when band member Colin Gibb put out an X-rated Black Lace album called The Blue (released in Tenerife). In 2016, he reunited with singer Gordon King for what was billed as the band's 40th anniversary tour. Alan Barton died in a coach crash in 1995 while touring with Smokie, while Rob Hopcraft died as a result of a fall in May 2020.\n\nPrima Donna were part of a tangled Eurovision dynasty: one singer Danny Finn, was formerly in The New Seekers, our 1972 entry, while fellow band-member Lance Aston was the brother of Bucks Fizz singer, and future 1981 winner, Jay Aston. Prima Donna's Sally Ann Triplett, meanwhile, would return to Eurovision two years after that, as one half of UK entry Bardo.\n\nUnable to hold together such a powerful nexus of Europop talent, the band's flame burned only briefly; our 1980 hope had disbanded before the year was over.\n\nNotorious for their skirt-ripping dance routine, Bucks Fizz not only blazed to victory at Eurovision but also went on to sell 15 million records worldwide, with further UK number one hits including The Land of Make Believe and My Camera Never Lies.\n\nBut in 1984, tragedy struck: a bus crash broke the spine of band member Cheryl Baker, and sent fellow singer Mike Nolan into a three-day coma, causing injuries from which he has never fully recovered. Creative difference led to a legal battle over the rights to the band name in the late Nineties and early Noughties, in what The Telegraph later called \"one of the messiest break-ups in music history\".\n\nGoing by The Fizz, Baker, Nolan and Aston got back together in 2009 and embarked on a UK-wide tour. In the 2019 general election, Aston briefly became a politician when she stood for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in Kensington, but received less than 1 per cent of the vote. Their third studio album, Smoke & Mirrors, was released in March, reaching 29th in the charts. They are currently back on tour.\n\nCrackerjack presenter and former Prima Donna member Sally Ann Triplett only reached seventh place with this duet, joined by her real-life romantic partner Stephen Fischer. Fischer went on to work as a keyboardist with Boy George and Bob Geldof, while Triplett has found success in Broadway musicals and on the West End stage.\n\nThis now-forgotten teenage pop trio finished in sixth place. When their follow-up single failed to chart, the band split up just a few months after Eurovision. Pretty boy Bobby McVay became a local radio presenter, before joining Bucks Fizz on their 2015 reunion tour, while fellow dreamer Carrie Grant became a vocal coach, returning to Eurovision in 2014 to head the UK's expert jury.\n\nThe poor behaviour of British football fans at a 1983 Luxembourg match meant that this trio were greeted with boos as they took the stage in Luxembourg for Eurovision 1984. Their Supremes-like love song finished in seventh place, and the band split up soon afterwards, though \"Belle\" (real name: Kit Rolfe) would return to Eurovision in 1991 as a backing singer for Britain's Samantha Janus. Rolfe also recorded an unsuccessful novelty single with failed Olympic skier Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards.\n\nVictoria Watson was our first female Eurovision entry to perform a self-penned song. Her ballad only came in fourth place, but Watson has since used her ethereal vocals to great effect, after changing her name, moving to Los Angeles and rebranding herself as an Celtic-influenced ambient folk singer.\n\nShe hasn't made much of an impact on the pop world, putting out a string of online-only releases before a 2015 comeback album. But she's a big name in Hollywood sound-design: her atmospheric, wordless vocals have been used on more than 70 film trailers, including The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies and the 2016 Dan Brown adaptation Inferno.\n\nShe now performs under the name Aeone (pronounced \"ay-own\"). According to her website, the new name means \"an endless period of time that is essentially female, feeling without thinking\".\n\nThe pop sextet Ryder (led by singer Maynard Williams) were manufactured created purely to take part in Eurovision. The result was a disaster: their song only placed seventh in the competition, and didn't even scrape into the top 75 in the UK singles chart, making it the worst commercial flop of any British Eurovision entry. In 1987, Williams sang the theme tune for the BBC sitcom Truckers, also better forgotten. After popping up in a 1996 episode of Heartbeat, he seemingly retired from showbiz for good.\n\nLike \"Vikki\" before him and \"Emma\" after, the mononymous Scottish singer Rikki seems to have chosen his name with a view to future anonymity: it's not so much a pop rebrand as a Eurovictim protection programme, helping failed entrants to hide their shame.\n\nBorn Richard Peebles, he arrived at the door of Eurovision having previously written a few songs for a middle-of-the-road pop band called Middle of the Road. Rikki finished in 13th place, and never made it into the UK top 75 chart. After a botched 1987 debut album, he has avoided the limelight, writing songs for club performers.\n\nWhen The Mirror tracked him down for a 1996 interview, he recalled how badly he had been hurt by Eurovision. \"I cried,\" he said. \"I thought I had let my country down in front of all those millions of viewers. I would never, ever do it again.\"\n\nThe overwrought ballad Go was yet another second-place near-miss for the UK. It was written by Bruce Forsyth's daughter Julie, who joined Scottish singer Fitzgerald onstage for Eurovision in Dublin. Fitzgerald was raised on a Glasgow tenement where, in his early childhood, he befriended a girl called Marie Lawrie - who grew up to become the 1969 Eurovision winner Lulu. His own pop career stalled after his silver medal 19 years later, but his son Ki Fitzgerald has fared better - he's a founding member of Noughties boy band Busted.\n\nFor Eurovision voters, Live Report clearly got something right, receiving the most perfect 12-point scores from judges. Sadly, it wasn't enough to win: Britain came second (there's a theme emerging, here) to Yugoslavia. The band's lead singer Ray Caruana is actually Maltese, and was later a runner-up in the contest to represent Malta for Eurovision 1994.\n\nAt just 15 years old, Emma Booth remains Britain's youngest Eurovision contestant. Her song finished sixth and broke into the UK top 40, but, in what was by now a fine British tradition, her follow-up single failed to chart.\n\nAccording to the local news site Wales Online, as of 2004 Booth was making a living singing on cruise ships. Her other post-Eurovision work involved touring with the Chuckle Brothers, and supporting Keith Harris and Orville the Duck.\n\nAfter placing 10th in Eurovision, Brighton-born Samantha quit the pop world for a career in acting, playing Sandy in a West End revival of Grease. She is best known, however, for playing the icy Ronnie Mitchell in EastEnders from 2007-2017.\n\nAlready a successful West End musical performer, Ball took the UK to second place (again!) in Eurovision, before hosting his own ITV music show, and releasing a string of gold-selling albums. He still performs regularly, and presents a show on BBC Radio 2. In 2015, he received an OBE for services to musical theatre.\n\nIn March 2019, Ball released the album Coming Home To You, which became his first number one album as a solo artist in almost three decades. The same year, he performed in a placeholder production of Les Mis\u00e9rables with long-time collaborator Alfie Boe, while the West End production moved theatres. His NHS-fundraising cover of You'll Never Walk Alone, with Capt Tom Moore, topped the charts during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLiverpool singer Sonia Evans came second (again!) in Eurovision with this rock 'n' roll number, having already racked up several UK chart hits (most notably 1989's You'll Never Stop Me Loving You). When her recording career hit a post-Eurovision slump, she took to the London stage, briefly playing Sandy in Grease (before handing over the role to our 1991 entry Samantha Janus).\n\nAfterwards, she slid into reality television (ITV's Reborn in the USA, a 2003 vehicle for has-been pop stars) and regional panto. But in 2012, she had a one-off return to a major stage, performing at London's O2 Arena for a Hit Factory Live concert alongside Kylie Minogue. She signed a new record deal with Energise Records in 2019, and released the single A Night That's Never Ending later that year.\n\nAfter placing 10th in 1994 with We Will Be Free, Ruffelle followed several other Eurovisionistas into musical theatre. She has found success in the West End, appearing in Trevor Nunn's Tony Award-winning RSC Les Mis\u00e9rables, and playing the title role in Piaf. In 2017, she starred in the musical The Wild Party, at Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End venue The Other Palace.\n\nBritain's first foray into Eurovision hip-hop reached number seven in the charts, but only placed tenth in the contest. The group's rapper Stephen \"Beanz\" Rudden has since found work as a jobbing producer, writing the theme tune for 1998's forgotten Kelsey Grammer comedy The Real Howard Spitz.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul Hardy (who sang the chorus) tried to rise from the ashes by rebranding himself Paul Phoenix and signing up to compete on BBC One's The Voice in 2016. Sadly, he didn't even make it through the initial blind-audition round.\n\nBorn and raised in Australia, Gina Gardiner's saucy pop tune didn't go down well at Eurovision (placing seventh), but it became a UK number one. Despite a successful debut album, she left the music industry following a lengthy legal battle with her producer. She tried to make a comeback in 2005, competing unsuccessfully to represent Britain in Eurovision again. She then moved to Los Angeles to run her own record label, Stunt Girl Music.\n\nIn 1997, Katrina and the Waves were no longer Walking on Sunshine, with their Eighties heyday a distant memory. But winning Eurovision in 1997 brought them back into the limelight, giving them their biggest-selling UK single to date. Later that year, lead singer Katrina Leskanich caused a tabloid rumpus when she was photographed kissing comedian Caroline Aherne at a Sony Awards dinner. Leskanich left the band in 1998, finding work as a Radio 2 DJ, releasing several (non-chart) solo albums, and co-authoring a travel guide to London with her pet poodle, Peggy Lee. As of 2023, she was still touring.\n\nImaani's song Where Are You came a very respectable second to Israel's Dana International. Released as a single, it remained in the UK charts for over two months, but Imaani was dropped by EMI before a follow up single.\n\nShe continues to perform regularly alongside jazz-funk band Incognito. Her first solo album, Standing Tall, was released in 2014, but it failed to chart. No UK act since has exceeded her Eurovision score of 166, which remains her greatest career achievement to date.\n\nGirl band Precious split up the year after they competed in Eurovision, having released just four singles. The song they took to Jerusalem in 1999, Say It Again, gained only 38 points.\n\nTheir best-known member was Jenny Frost, who went on to join Atomic Kitten in 2000. Replacing Kerry Katona, Frost released three number one singles with the group before they split in 2004. Her more recent exploits have included appearing in I'm A Celebrity... in 2005, presenting the BBC Three show Snog, Marry Avoid? and becoming the face of homeopathic medicine company Nelson's. She would, in turn, be re-replaced by Katona in 2012.\n\nAmong the other Precious members, Sophie McDonnell had a brief spell as a presenter on CBBC, while lead singer Louise Rose went into acting, and has appeared in Moving Wallpaper and Luther. Kalli Clark-Sternberg is now a session-singer, while Anya Lahiri is a boot-camp trainer.\n\nFrench sang Don't Play That Song Again to the crowds in Stockholm in 2000. They seemed to agree, awarding the UK just 28 points.\n\nThese days, French performs at Pride events across the world, and has appeared on British theatre stages too, starring in Menopause: The Musical in 2007. Despite not coming out top in Eurovision, her entry was nonetheless released in a 2015 special edition EP, along with a four-disc anthology album, One Step Further.\n\nAt 16, Lindsay Dracass represented the UK with the song No Dream Impossible in 2001. The song placed 15th, and after one European tour and the single hitting number 32 in the charts, she went back to being a normal British teenager. She now works as a vocal coach. In November 2019, she released a new album, Waiting for You.\n\nAfter being among the last 10 contestants on Pop Idol 2002, Welsh singer Garlick represented the UK in Tallinn. Her score of 111 points made her the highest scoring British act of the 2000s, and won her (joint) third place. She featured in a number of subsequent Eurovision analysis programmes, including the following year's UK selection show, A Song For Europe.\n\nShe embarked on a solo career in 2009, but has never really escaped Eurovision, releasing her first single the day before the semi-final, and giving her first live performance at the Eurovision Preview Party 2009. Other notable appearances include featuring on the identity parade in BBC panel show Never Mind the Buzzcocks in 2006.\n\nAfter gaining notoriety for coming last in the 2003 contest in Latvia, gaining the dreaded score of \"nul points\" for Cry Baby, Liverpudlian duo Jemini were dropped by their record company. Gemma Abbey subsequently worked in a car showroom, while Chris Cromby found employment in a clothes shop.\n\nThat wasn't the end of their Eurovision career though. The pair were (for some reason) interviewed for the 2013 BBC special How To Win Eurovision, and reunited in 2014 for a Eurovision special episode of BBC game show Pointless Celebrities.\n\nIn 2016, Abbey was convicted of benefits fraud. The singer had claimed over \u00a367,000 in tax credits as a single mother, despite being married; officials found photographs of her wedding on Facebook.\n\nWelsh singer James Fox followed up his 16th-place finish by writing and recording the official 2008 FA Cup song for Cardiff FC. Since then he has become a fixture in musical theatre, recently playing Paul McCartney in the West End and Broadway runs of Beatles musical Let It Be. He has also supported a range of celebrities, including Tina Turner, Wet Wet Wet and Lulu. He is still energetically releasing new music.\n\nIn a shock vote, Javine was chosen to represent the UK over Katie Price's autotune-defying offering Not Just Anybody. Her song, Touch My Fire, came 22nd (of 24) in the final. She continued a career as an R&B singer and television personality, appearing on Never Mind The Buzzcocks and Skins. She won Channel 4 game show The Games in 2006, and came second in Celebrity Come Dine With Me in 2010. She is now the face of Javine Total Fitness, her own sports and fitness brand.\n\nDaz Sampson represented the UK in Eurovision after releasing several reasonably successful dance tracks in the UK and Europe. His co-written entry Teenage Life, featuring backing dancers dressed as school girls known as The Sampsonites, perhaps slightly misjudged the age and sexuality of the average Eurovision viewer and only scored 25 points. It proved more popular with the home crowd however, charting at 8 in the UK Top 40.\n\nIn 2011 Sampson re-launched himself as a hypnotist, telling the Manchester Evening News he intended to \"quit the recording studio and help make the world become a happier and a healthier place.\" A Twitter feed associated with Daz (which describes him as a fortune-teller, inter alia), announced in May 2015 that he would soon be \"back in the studio [...] i want to say sorry in advance for what comes out. but i have a family to feed.\" No new tracks have since emerged, so Sampson's family are presumably still peckish.\n\nSampson also works as a professional football manager and scout, with links to Scottish Championship side Ayr United and Stockport County in England's National League North.\n\nIt may surprise viewers of Scooch's airline-themed Eurovision appearance to learn that this was not the group's first TV performance. In fact, in 1999 they won the opportunity to have a single released after beating a rival band in a competition on TV show Live & Kicking.\n\nDespite mixed sentiment surrounding Scooch's entry (Charlotte Church described the act as \"absolute s---\", and Swedish singer Pandora accused Flying The Flag of plagiarism), the act were the first in five years to receive \"douze points\" for the UK, winning the maximum score from Malta.\n\nDisappointingly, none of the band now work for an airline. Natalie Powers is a singing coach at a performing arts school, David Ducasse works at a vets while Caroline Barnes and Russ Spencer started a relationship post-Eurovision, and became one of the longest lasting couples on series 4 of Channel 4 game show Coach Trip in 2010.\n\nX-Factor runner-up Andy Abraham's performance of Even If came joint last in Belgrade in 2008. But he remained on the UK stage, touring the show An Evening with Andy Abraham for two years after the contest. More recently, he played both Judas and John the Baptist in a touring revival of the musical Godspell, alongside his successor at Eurovision, Jade Ewen.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber led the UK selection programme which voted Jade Ewen as the 2009 UK entry, and played piano alongside her in the song It's My Time. Ewen placed fifth in the end, gaining points from 31 countries.\n\nLike 1999 contestant Jenny Frost, she went on to join a three-piece girl band that has a fairly constant rotation of members: the Sugababes. In 2013 she was the first celebrity to be eliminated on BBC game show Splash!.\n\nJosh Dubovie was the third UK entry to place last in 10 years, his song That Sounds Good To Me winning only 10 points.\n\nHe has since changed his stage name to Josh James, as searches including Dubovie only returned results relating to Eurovision, preventing him from forging a new reputation. His debut solo single was released in 2013, peaking at number 179. His website lists his current occupations as \"mindset coach, dreamer, dad and entrepreneur\".\n\nTen years after the boyband formed, Blue marked their return to showbiz by performing the song I Can. The song placed 11th, and the band complained they were the victims of political voting.\n\nTheir limited company, Blueworld Touring No1 Ltd dissolved in 2014, and since then every member of Blue has declared themselves bankrupt. Blue had a one album and one single deal with Sony for 2015's Colours, which sold over 8,500 copies in its first week on sale. Following the tour of Colours, members Lee Ryan and Duncan James went on to have acting careers in EastEnders and Hollyoaks respectively. The group released their sixth studio album Heart & Soul in 2022.\n\nTraditional crooner Engelbert Humperdinck was put forward to represent the UK through internal selection. Performing with no sequins on his outfit and no backing dancers at all, he placed second last with 12 points.\n\nNow in his eighties, Humperdinck has sold more than 140 million records and continues to tour, but Love Will Set You Free rarely makes an appearance on his set-lists.\n\nTyler may have been past her Eighties heyday (when she had a string of hit ballads such as Total Eclipse of the Heart), but she still won plaudits from the critics for her Eurovision single. Tyler was the first UK entrant to receive the Eurovision Song Contest Radio Awards for Best Song and Best Female Singer.\n\nThat didn't change the fact that her performance of Believe In Me came a lowly 19th. Unlike some previous entries, its poor performance at Eurovision was repeated in the UK market, only reaching a peak chart position of 93.\n\nNonetheless, she has continued to record and perform as if it never happened. She released her most recent album in April this year.\n\nChildren Of The Universe, Molly's self-penned ballad designed to \"break down political boundaries\", seemed a subtle attempt from the UK internal selection committee to actually make an impact, and before the final the UK was among the favourites to win. It was not to be however, with Smitten-Downes winning only 40 points on the night.\n\nHer musical career hasn't progressed a huge amount since then, her only noteworthy release being a guest appearance on a 2015 track by German DJ Zwette.\n\nThis likeable (and unfairly mocked) electro-swing duo comprised The X Factor and The Voice reject Bianca Nicholas, and Alex Larke, the Mick Jagger part of a Rolling Stones tribute act. Alas, after placing 24th in Eurovision, plans for a debut LP were shelved due to Nicholas's poor health. Nicholas, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, has become a prominent public face for people living with the condition, and in December 2016 she released a cover-version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. In February 2017, Larke released his debut solo single, Shine On.\n\nLight-rock duo Joe Woolford and Jake Shakeshaft (from Ruthin and Stoke-on-Trent, respectively) are still together and still gigging in small venues. In October 2016, the band played a charity fundraising gig at the Ruthin Farmers Auction to raise money for a local girl's medical treatment. That same month, they tweeted that they were recording \"lots of songs\", but only one follow-up to their Eurovision single has been released: 2017's Tongue Tied, which failed to chart.\n\nThe 27-year-old X-Factor contestant was the bookies' fifth-favourite to win the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest, but the singer finished in 15th place, blaming Brexit for her disappointing result. Since the show, Jones has turned her attention to musicals, appearing as Holly in the UK tour of The Wedding Singer, and reprising her role as Elle Woods in a nine-month run of Legally Blonde. In 2019, she was cast in the West End musical Waitress, and after a hiatus, returned to the role after the coronavirus pandemic closed the theatres. She won best takeover performance at the WhatsOnStage Awards in 2023, and starred in Wicked and Les Miserables.\n\nSuRie, born Susanna Marie Cork, finished 24th in 2018's Eurovision Song Contest. In 2015, she provided backing vocals for Belgium's Eurovision entry, and in 2017 she was the musical director for another Belgian contestant.\n\nHer own performance was notable for its interruption. SuRie was thrown off when a protester stormed the stage, took the microphone and shouted \"Modern Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom, war is not peace.\" She was diagnosed with PTSD after the incident.\n\nHer follow-up singles have failed to chart in the UK.\n\nMichael Rice finished dead last in the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest, the UK's fourth bottom-placed finish. Rice had previously won the BBC One singing competition All Together Now, and appeared in the 11th series of The X Factor in 2014.\n\nFollowing Eurovision, Rice released the single Somebody, which failed to chart, and performed in small venues across the UK. In the build-up to last year's aborted show, he appeared on a number of local radio stations to comment on James Newman's UK entry.\n\nNewman was due to represent the UK at the 2020 contest, but after that was nixed by the pandemic, he was instead chosen as our sacrificial lamb for Eurovision 2021. Sadly, a global pandemic didn't ameliorate Britain's chances and Newman's bland entry, Embers, joined a select club and scored \"nul points\".\n\nThe 37-year-old Londoner doesn't lack musical talent - he won a Brit award in 2014 for co-writing Rudimental's hit Waiting All Night - but his career hasn't exactly caught fire since Eurovision: to date, he has released no new music.\n\nRecognition at last! British glitter lovers could finally hold their heads high again as the genial 33-year-old romped home to second place behind that year's predictable (and deserved) winners Ukraine.\n\nCatchy and heartfelt, with an Elton John-esque belter of a chorus, his ballad was undeniably the best song we've submitted for some time. (In fact, the last time we placed so highly was in 1998 with Imanni's Where Are You.)\n\nBut what sealed the deal for Ryder was his Tigerish bounce and unmistakable joy at the whole shebang. An inspiration.\n\n... And what a bruising experience that proved. Muller's entry was a decent hit of affirmative revenge pop, sending up a needy ex-boyfriend in fine style - a nice representation of her appeal to the Gen Z, TikTok crowd.\n\nAlas, the UK's flame-out into second-last place all-but-killed her singing career. Muller released a follow-up album, but it was a damb squib and in January this year she dropped her label and announced her intention to work as a solo artist. So far, the 26-year-old singer has released no new music, though her social media has been teasing its appearance.\n\nBut if that comes to naught, she can always fall back on her acting: she appeared in street gang drama Gassed Up in February.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Credit - Jessica Gow -- TT News Agency/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPerformers from across Europe and beyond will compete in the first semi-final of the 68th Eurovision Song Contest on Tuesday, amid heightened security prompted by pro-Palestinian protesters objecting to Israel's participation in the competition.\n\nThe international songwriting competition kicked off over the weekend in Malmo, Sweden. The city already expected about 100,000 fans to visit, and amped up security for the event in anticipation of thousands of people protesting Israel's participation in the contest. Protests are expected to take place Thursday and Saturday, coinciding with the competition's second semi-final and the grand final, Associated Press reported.\n\n\"I think it's obvious that the world's insecurity has also affected Eurovision,\" Malmo Police Chief Petra Stenkula told BBC a few days before the event began. \"In Sweden, and Malmo in particular, there have been protests against Israel taking part in the competition.\"\n\nWhile Stenkula told BBC that there were no specific threats to the contest, additional security officials have been called in from across Sweden, in addition to Denmark and Norway. Some officers may carry larger weapons as a precaution, and officials have also set up cameras around the venue.\n\nSweden had already been \"on a terror level of four out of five,\" Stenkula told BBC. The country increased the alert level in August 2023, after a spate of Quran-burning incidents sparked outrage and triggered protests in many Muslim-majority countries.\n\nMore than 150 million people from around the world watch Eurovision. Organizers insist the event is apolitical, and recently branded it with the slogan \"United by Music.\" Organizers have long banned most flags and signs from the contest -- the only exceptions are participants' national flags and the pride flag, meaning that Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols are not allowed inside the Malmo Arena venue.\n\nJean Philip De Tender is the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the competition, and he told Sky News that barring Israel from the competition \"would have been a political decision, and as such (one) which we cannot take.\"\n\nOrganizers did previously tell Israel to change the lyrics of its song, initially called \"October Rain,\" because of its apparent reference to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,200 Israelis. Organizers had said that they would disqualify participants who didn't abide by Eurovision's apolitical nature, according to Reuters. Israeli singer Eden Golan will still perform the song at Eurovision, but it's since been renamed to \"Hurricane,\" Associated Press reported.\n\nThe war in Gaza has killed nearly 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TT_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TT News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petra"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health, Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_time_773/2f4dfefedc6fbaa162df83418214795e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2739, "textEnd": 2745}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

He wrote on social media that the European Broadcasting Union was \"disgraceful,\" and accused it of disseminating \"Israeli propaganda.\"\n\nIn response to a request for comment by The Times of Israel, the EBU noted that the show is live and that \"all performers are made aware of the rules of the contest.\" The EBU added that \"we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nSaade did not wear the keffiyeh in his rehearsals for the show. As he is not a contestant in this year's competition, it is unclear if he will face any repercussions for violating the Eurovision rules.\n\nOn its official social media, the Eurovision posted clips of the performances of the other two opening acts -- Eleni Foureira and Chanel -- but not of Saade.\n\nEurovision organizers have been on high alert for disruptions and protests this week as the competition has been overshadowed by political conflict, with major rallies expected in Malmo against Israel's participation. The city has significantly beefed up its police presence, including bringing in reinforcements from Denmark and Norway, and has even cleared out local jail cells in case of mass arrests.\n\nThe biggest protests are expected on Thursday, when Israel's Eden Golan will appear in the second semifinal of the competition with her song \"Hurricane.\" Police have said that no protests will be allowed in the vicinity of the arena.\n\nGolan has been largely confined to her hotel room throughout the week, with a heavy security detail amid a series of threats against the delegation. In an unusual move, the head of the Shin Bet even visited Malmo last week to coordinate security ahead of the event.\n\nAt the culmination of Tuesday's semifinal, 10 nations advanced to Saturday's grand final, including the Israeli-born singer representing Luxembourg, Tali Golergant, who goes by the mononym Tali.\n\nLuxembourg returned to the competition this year after a 31-year absence with the French and English song \"Fighter.\" Tali, who was born in Israel and raised in Chile, Argentina and Luxembourg, told The Times of Israel in an interview last month, Tali said she has faced online hate over her background, but doesn't let it affect her.\n\nThe other countries who qualified on Tuesday were Ireland, Croatia, Cyprus, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland, Serbia, Portugal and Slovenia.\n\nIn a post-competition press conference, Irish contestant Bambie Thug told reporters that they were forced to change a subliminal message calling for a ceasefire in Gaza after a complaint from organizers.\n\nA question from a local reporter asked the singer about the messages written on their face and leg in Ogham, an ancient Irish language, which read \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine.\"\n\nIn response, they said that they wanted to send that message because \"I am pro-justice and pro-peace,\" but said that \"unfortunately, I had to change those messages... on order from the EBU.\"\n\nTwenty-six nations will compete on Saturday evening for the chance to win the top prize at the contest. The betting odds heavily favor Croatia, which has never won the competition before. Israel has won four times, most recently in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Only ten countries from each show will progress to the grand final which means 17 representatives will be axed.\n\nThis year has seen some massive changes implemented. 'The Big Five' and host nation Sweden will perform during the semi-finals for the first time to give them a fairer standing in the eyes of the audience.\n\nREAD MORE: Get information on summer events sent straight to your phone\n\nREAD MORE: I ate at the restaurant on its way to gaining a Michelin star\n\n'The Big Five' consists of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Every year they get a pass to the final because of their contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The host nation joins the Big Five in progressing to the finals as a courtesy from the contest but this year all six countries will perform in the semi-finals.\n\nIn previous years, only a short clip of their rehearsal performances was shown during the semi-finals. In a historic move for the contest, The Big Five and the host nation will perform regardless of their already qualifying conditions to evenly balance all of the acts in the eyes of the audience.\n\nEbba Adielsson, executive producer of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 said: \"We think that this change gives the Big Five countries and the host country a fairer playing field in the Grand Final, as they now have the opportunity to perform \"for real\" on stage in the semi-finals.\n\n\"It is also a win for both the audience in the arena and the viewers at home, in that they get to see all the acts competing this year live before the Grand Final.\"\n\nThe UK's representative, Olly Alexander, will perform his melodic pop banger 'Dizzy' fifth in the running of the first semi-final.\n\nHow to vote in Eurovision semi-finals and final\n\nViewers can cast their votes via the official Eurovision Song Contest app (or by following instructions on screen) during the live broadcast. The app is available for your iOS, Android or Windows device, and if you vote via the app you will receive a special video message from your favourite artists.\n\nOn Saturday, May 11, voting will open just before the first song is performed. Viewers at home will be able to cast their votes as the songs are performed, rather than waiting until all entries have been presented, as has been the case since public voting was introduced in 1997 (except in 2010 and 2011 when voting also began at the start of the show).\n\nAdditionally, fans in non-participating countries will now have nearly 24 hours to vote for their favourite songs before each of the live shows begin. Online voting will open for the rest of the world immediately after the second dress rehearsal for each semi-final and rehearsal for the Grand Final has finished and will stay open until the live shows begin.\n\nReceive top stories on everything going on in Merseyside including events, shopping and food and drink through our newsletter by signing up here", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_megrath@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Christopher Megrath", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelin Guide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29109259.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/20525_Sarah-Louise-Bennett_EBU_21926-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 100, "textEnd": 106, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 154, "textEnd": 159}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 199, "textEnd": 204}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

2024, 9:32 PM Last updated: Tue 7 May 2024, 9:48 PM\n\nBy Charlotte McLaughlin, PA Senior Entertainment Reporter in Malmo, Sweden\n\nThe organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have said they \"regret\" the opening act making a political statement over the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nFormer Swedish Eurovision contestant Eric Saade was not competing and had the keffiyeh symbol, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm on Tuesday as he performed his 2011 entry Popular.\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show.\n\n\"All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nAhead of the event at Malmo Arena, fans were warned not to bring Palestinian flags, symbols or bags and were told that there will be \"vigorous security checks\".\n\nSaade had earlier seemed to hit out at the restrictions.\n\nHe wrote on Instagram questioning if freedom is \"controversial\" and why people keep asking if it is \"political\".\n\nThe terrorist threat level is on four points out of five, but the Swedish Police Authority has said that this is not related to the contest.\n\nThere have been several calls and protests urging a boycott of Eurovision this year as Eden Golan competes for Israel.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 7 May 2024, 9:32 PM Last updated: Tue 7 May 2024, 9:48 PM", "source": {"uri": "meathchronicle.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Meath Chronicle"},

THE DENMARK KISS - 1957\n\nDenmark's Birthe Wilke and Gustav Winckler enjoy the longest on-screen kiss in the contest's history in 1957\n\nEurovision has seen its fair share of sexy moments over the years but one of the first - and most shocking - came in 1957 courtesy of an on-stage kiss between Danes Birthe Wilke and Gustav Winckler.\n\nHaving performed Skibet skal sejle i nat (The Ship Will Be Leaving Tonight), the pair ended their routine with a kiss that went on for 11 seconds - the result, reportedly, of a stage hand failing to give them the cue to stop.\n\n2. CLIFF RICHARD'S VOTE-RIGGING SCANDAL - 1968\n\nCliff Richard is thought to be the first victim of political voting after he lost to Spain by one point\n\nPolitically motivated vote-rigging has left a bitter taste in many a Briton's mouth over the years, with the UK able to rely only on fellow nil points specialist, Ireland.\n\nOne of the most memorable instances came in 1968 when Cliff Richard's Congratulations lost out to Spain's Massiel singing La La La by just one mark.\n\nRumours at the time suggested Spain's General Franco had sent emissaries to bribe participating countries with offers of buying their home-grown TV series.\n\nRegardless of their veracity, Cliff has since gone on to sell more than 250 million records and is still loved today, while Massiel, although still a singer, has enjoyed a rather less stellar career.\n\n3. JAHN TEIGEN'S NIL POINTS - 1978\n\nEurovision's point scoring system is notoriously unforgiving, with the leader board proving a source of anxiety for those languishing at the bottom.\n\nOne contestant who knows all-too-well how that feels is Norway's Jahn Teigen, who in 1978 became the first person to achieve the infamous nil points.\n\nHis entry Mil etter mil (Mile After Mile) didn't fare well with voters, leaving him red-faced when the rankings were announced.\n\n4. BUCKFIZZ'S OUTFIT CHANGE - 1981\n\nBucks Fizz won the contest for the UK at the Dublin final in 1981. But while the song made headlines, the performance is remembered for a risqu\u00e9 outfit change halfway through.\n\nWhile singing Making Your Mind Up, the male members of the group whipped off Jay Aston and Cheryl Baker's skirts in what has now become known as the 'skirt rip routine'.\n\nSo memorable did the manoeuvre prove, it has repeatedly been referenced in sitcoms and sketches by comedians such as Miranda Hart.\n\n5. DANA INTERNATIONAL - 1998\n\nDana International became the first transgender winner when she bagged first place for Israel in 1998\n\nIsraeli Dana International wasn't expected to win in 1998 but has since become one of the most prominent symbols of Eurovision.\n\nBorn male, Dana's Birmingham triumph has arguably led to greater acceptance of transsexuals, both within Eurovision and without.\n\n'Winning was huge for me and my country,' says Dana, now 55. 'But also for the gay and transsexual community all over Europe. I became a big gay icon all over Europe.'\n\n6. TATU'S FROSTY RECEPTION - 2003\n\nDisliked: t.A.T.u were famously booed during rehearsals after turning up late and insulting other contestants\n\nHowever bad the song might be, most entrants get a warm reception and a smattering of applause from the Eurovision crowd.\n\nOne entry that didn't was Russia's t.A.T.u who, in 2003 got a frosty reception after failing to turn up to rehearsals and insulting the other entrants, including calling Germany's Lou a 'witch'.\n\nWhen the pair finally did make an at appearance at rehearsals they were met by boos and jeers from the audience.\n\n7. KATIE PRICE'S ENTRY - 2005\n\nKate Price (pictured in 2005) failed to qualify for the Eurovision Song Contest - a moment she later claimed to regret\n\nIn 2005, the mother-of-five famously made a bid to represent the UK at the Eurovision pre-selection show, Making Your Mind Up.\n\nSinging a song entitled Not Just Anybody, the reality star was heavily pregnant at the time and emphasised the fact in a ghastly pink latex cat suit that had a Teletubbies vibe to it.\n\nNeedless to say, the song failed to make the cut and during her appearance on last year's Celebrity Big Brother, Ms Price admitted it was one of her biggest regrets.\n\n'I wouldn't change anything apart from Eurovision,' she said. 'I looked shocking, I sounded shocking and I couldn't sing the song now, I couldn't sing it then!'\n\n8. LORDI'S SHOCK WIN - 2006\n\nLordi (pictured), the winners of Eurovision Song Contest, raised eyebrows with their performance in 2006\n\nThe Finnish heavy metal band Lordi caused quite a stir in 2006 with their entry Hard Rock Hallelujah.\n\nLooking like a quartet of orcs from Lord of the Rings, the band screamed themselves to first place at the Athens final.\n\nWhat's more, they also managed to rack up a record-breaking 292 points and remain the first and only entrant to take first place for Finland.\n\n9. THE CYNDI/ SCOOCH MIX-UP - 2007\n\nHe might have been much loved during his 37-year stint fronting the Song Contest in the UK but Terry Wogan doesn't have an entirely unblemished record.\n\nIn 2007, the presenter made his most famous faux pas when he announced that the wrong act had been chosen to represent the UK at Eurovision.\n\nWhile his co-host Fearne Cotton announced the correct name, Scooch, Wogan simultaneously shouted 'Cyndi' leaving the audience confused and Cyndi less than impressed.\n\n10. VERKA SERDUCHKA'S SPACE-AGE MADNESS - 2007\n\nColourful: Ukraine's Verka Serduchka proved popular in 2007 - apart from in Russia where she was banned\n\nPrior to Conchita Wurst's winning turn, the title of Eurovision's most memorable drag artist belonged to Ukraine's 2007 entry, Verka Serduchka.\n\nHer bizarre offering, Dancing Lasha Tumbai, saw her emerge clad in a tinfoil ensemble and singing an unfortunate tune, which nevertheless proved surprisingly popular.\n\nDespite her popularity at Eurovision, the music fans of Russia had other ideas and she was banned from performing there for one year.\n\n11. FINLAND'S LESBIAN KISS - 2013\n\nKrista Siegfrids of Finland sparked backlash after she kissed her girlfriend during her performance to comment on her country's ban on gay weddings\n\nIn 2012, the Finnish entry Marry Me by Krista Siegfrids sparked controversy after the singer engaged in a kiss with her girlfriend during the performance in protest of her country's ban on gay weddings.\n\nMiss Siegfrids chose her song, Marry Me, as a protest against the Finnish parliament's decision to turn down a vote on gay marriage legislation in 2012.\n\nGreek and Turkish newspapers published furious responses, complaining the kiss breaks Eurovision rules.\n\nThe competition's rules forbid 'lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature'.\n\nThey added: 'The lyrics and/or performance of the songs shall not bring the Shows, the ESC [Eurovision Song Contest] as such or the EBU [European Broadcasting Union] into disrepute.'\n\nHowever, Miss Siegfrids denied her protest was political, saying: 'Homophobic people are angry with me for doing this. But I'm planning a surprise at the end of my performance. It's live on TV, so nobody can stop me.\n\n12. CONCHITA WURSTS BEARDED TRIUMPH - 2014\n\nBearded drag queen Conchita Wurst (pictured) representing Austria, caused controversy in 2014\n\nWhen Austria announced that a bearded drag queen would be representing them in the Eurovision Song Contest it is fair to say that a few eyebrows were raised.\n\nHowever, far from the novelty act that had been expected, Conchita provided a flawless vocal performance and attracted votes from countries which actively inhibit LGBT rights.\n\nAhead of her smash hit performance, several countries threatened to cut the song until they were forced into a U-turn by the European Broadcasting Union. Conchita came first and has since become a symbol of tolerance and freedom in the EU.\n\n13. AUSTRALIA ENTERS THE CONTEST - 2015\n\nIn 2015, Eurovision competition raised eyebrows when Australia entered the competition with Guy Sebastian's (pictured) performance in Vienna\n\nNo, you're not going mad -- Australia is definitely not in Europe. But in 2015, the country was invited to take part to mark Eurovision's 60th anniversary. However, the Land Down Under wasn't chosen at random.\n\nThe contest's organisers revealed they allowed the Antipodean nation into the event because Eurovision is absolutely huge in the country. The Australian network SBS had been broadcasting the contest for more than 30 years at that point.\n\nAustralia's entry was Guy Sebastian, who scored an impressive 196 points, with the country coming in fifth. The Aussies were invited back the following year and nearly ended up winning the whole thing, just losing out to Ukraine!\n\n14. UKRAINE BAN RUSSIA FROM PERFORMING - 2017\n\nDespite being promoted as a non-political event, Eurovision was mired in geo-political controversy in 2017 when the host nation, Ukraine, banned Russia's entry, Yulia Samoylova, from entering the country because she had previously performed in the Russia-occupied region of Crimea.\n\nA few weeks later, Russia decided to pull out of the contest completely, with the Russian TV station Channel One announcing that it would not broadcast the contest or take part.\n\n15. STAGE INVADER RUINS UK'S SURIE'S PERFORMANCE - 2018\n\nA fan invades the stage during the performance of SuRie at the 63rd annual Eurovision Song Contest in Lisbon\n\nThe UK's SuRie was performing ninth on the billing of 26 entries at last year's competition when she was rudely interrupted.\n\nHalf-way through her performance of Storm, a stage invader ran on, took her microphone and shouted: 'For the Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom,' before being tackled by security.\n\nSuRie opted to carry on with her performance and had to wait for a new microphone to be brought to her.\n\nDespite coming in 24th out of 26th, SuRie was praised by everyone for her professionalism, with Graham Norton describing her as a 'national heroine'.\n\n16. WINNERS DENY TAKING DRUGS - 2021\n\nDavid (second left), the lead singer of Maneskin has said that he is 'really offended' after speculation from viewers that he was taking cocaine during the Eurovision live final\n\nIn 2021, Damiano David from Italy's winning Eurovision band Maneskin denied taking cocaine following suggestions that he was caught on camera taking drugs during the broadcast.\n\nDamiano said: 'Thomas (guitarist Thomas Raggi) broke a glass ... I don't use drugs, please guys, do not say that.'\n\n17. RAUNCHY ACTS - 2024\n\nFans have slammed this year's Eurovision contest for being too 'provocative', including the UK's Olly Alexander (centre)\n\nEurovision fans have blasted this year's song contest for being too 'provocative' and 'raunchy', claiming that the prestigious show is now pandering to Gen Z audiences with flashy 'X Factor' style semi-finals.\n\nFans of the competition, which will be hosted in Malmo, Sweden this year, have been critical of acts including Slovenia's scantily clad Raiven and Olly Alexander for outfits and dance routines that aren't 'family friendly'.\n\nOlly is representing the United Kingdom with his catchy tune Dizzy, and performed the song with plenty of raunchy dance moves.\n\nIreland's entry Bambie Thug, 31, a non-binary artist from County Cork has also been criticised for their performance which sees them joined on stage by a male dancer wearing demonic makeup and fake teeth.\n\nSome Eurovision fans tuning into the semi-finals have been left aghast by the adult content on display in the build up to the event and criticised organisers and performers for not reading the room.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

During rehearsals, he did not wear the scarf. He put it on without anyone noticing before the live broadcast,\" they said.\n\nThe statement followed an earlier one immediately sent to the teams after Saade, who represented Sweden at the 2011 competition in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, performed the provocation.\n\n\"The Eurovision is a live TV show,\" they wrote. \"All the performers are aware of the rules of the competition, and we regret that Eric Saada chose to ignore the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nLast week, the Eurovision organizers said that they would remove any Palestinian flag or pro-Palestinian symbols during the competition.\n\nOfficials responsible for securing Israel's delegation to the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden are bracing for pro-Hamas provocations targeting Israeli contestant Eden Golan during the musical extravaganza's second semifinal on Thursday.\n\nIsrael Security Agency (Shin Bet) head Ronen Bar visited Malm\u00f6 last week to approve plans and coordinate with local officials to ensure the security of the delegation.\n\nGolan will perform the song \"Hurricane.\"\n\nSpeaking via video link from Malm\u00f6 to a Ynet and Yediot Ahronoth \"People of the State\" conference at Expo Tel Aviv, Golan said that \"we cannot at any moment forget what is happening in Israel, I am here on a very important mission and to show what kind of people we are -- beautiful and strong.\"\n\nIsraeli-born singer Tali Golergant advanced to Saturday night's Eurovision grand final after Tuesday's performance of \"Fighter\" in the southern Swedish coastal city.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who goes by the mononym Tali, was born in Jerusalem to a Peruvian Jewish father and an Israeli mother. She is representing Luxembourg. The country has returned to the competition after a 31-year absence.\n\nIsraeli flags, like those of all participating countries, are allowed in the arena, something that Golergant noted after her performance.\n\n\"It was impossible not to notice the flags. Please tell the Israelis that I love them and that we will see each other in the final,\" she told Ynet.\n\nThe Israeli delegation celebrated her qualification at the hotel. Upon hearing that team Israel was rooting for her, Golergant said that it was \"very exciting.\"", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_marks@jns.org", "name": "Josh Marks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keffiyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6 Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_Television", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sveriges Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronen_Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronen Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_Tel_Aviv", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expo Tel Aviv"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yedioth_Ahronoth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yedioth Ahronoth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ynet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ynet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luxembourg"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Luxembourg"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Busking_and_Street_Performing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Busking and Street Performing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://cdn.jns.org/uploads/2024/05/shutterstock_2411088345-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

But the grand final on Saturday evening (May 11) is just around the corner and will see 26 acts compete in the ultimate music contest to try and win fame and glory, as well as a pretty nifty trophy.\n\nTaking place in Malm\u00f6 in Sweden, following Loreen's triumphant win with Tattoo in Liverpool last year, the event is set to feature an assortment of performers as well as a Swedish twist to proceedings.

Like Germany, France, Italy, Spain and host nation Sweden, the UK automatically made it through to the final - with the rest of the grand final's performers having had to successfully get through their semi-final first.\n\nAs always, Eurovision fans celebrate the contest in a number of ways whether that it through house gatherings (with individual point systems for each attendee), or all-out parties and events. Thankfully, Manchester is one of the best places to be when it comes to celebrating Eurovision.\n\nThis year, there are plenty of viewing parties, silent disco events, DJ takeovers and quiz nights where you can root on your favourite performers, dress up in spectacular fashion and just have a generally amazing Eurovision-themed time.

Following Israel's fifth win in 2018, when singer Netta Barzilai roamed the stage with her infamous chicken impersonating song -- \"Toy\" -- many Irish celebrities lined up the following year to call for an Irish boycott of the competition hosted by Jerusalem.\n\nEurovision, of course, has never been far from politics. From the weary annual faux indignation at regional voting blocs to the now legendary story of the Portuguese entry song 50 years ago, \"E Depois do Adeus\" (And After The Farewell), when played over the radio in Lisbon on the night of April 25, 1974, it apparently gave the signal for the beginning of a military coup in Portugal.\n\nUkraine's emphatic victory in 2022, less than three months after the Russian invasion was another high political watermark. Its winning entry, attracting a wave of European empathy, garnered the top 12 or 'Douze Points' in the popular vote from 28 countries, an impressive 94% of the maximum vote possible from the voting public across Europe (and Australia!).\n\nIncidentally, the EBU in 2007 chose not to censor the obvious politically charged words of the Ukrainian entry \"Russia-Goodbye\", which came in a close second.\n\nThe chances of even more heightened political musical drama at this year's competition -- a Palestinian, Israeli showdown in the final -- were dashed when Jerusalem-born Palestinian artist Bashar Murad unexpectedly lost out to represent Iceland.\n\nMuch to the chagrin perhaps of many in the Irish music industry, who have been championing a boycott of the Eurovision, Israel's entry \"Hurricane\" sung by 20-year-old Eden Golan is currently 8th favourite to win. Ireland's Bambie Thug is just ahead in 7th place.\n\nDespite those betting odds, Israelis are not expecting many votes. Their mere presence at the competition this year is seen as a victory of sorts by those tasked to battle the BDS (Boycotts Sanctions Disinvestment) against Israel.\n\nThe Examiner spoke directly to the Israeli Ambassador in Sweden, Zvi Nevo Kulman, an apparent ardent fan of Eurovision. He had a direct message to those calling for a boycott in Ireland.\n\n\"Israel, like Sweden and Ireland, is one of the most successful countries in the history of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nIt is regrettable that a bunch of extremists -- like the kind of Islamic Jihadists who danced in the streets of Malmo after the October 7th massacre, combined with radical supporters of the BDS movement are hijacking all the attention.\n\nHe somewhat provocatively added that \"they are united by hate and have nothing to do with the values of the competition\".\n\nEven the President of Israel, Issac Herzog, has weighed in on the controversy with the Times of Israel quoting the President in February, saying: \"I think it's important for Israel to appear in Eurovision, and this is also a statement because there are haters who try to drive us off every stage,\".\n\nNo warm welcomes are expected for Israel however with reports that the customary red-carpet welcome for each contestant is to be shelved for the Israeli singer. Security is expected to be tight with a large Israeli security entourage accompanying Golan.\n\nThere are also reports that the authorities in Malmo, home to a large Muslim and Palestinian population, have sought police reinforcements, equipped with submachine guns, from neighbouring Denmark and Norway.\n\nThe Eurovision success of Israel, four-time winners of the competition, seems curiously linked to the backdrop of the Israel-Arab politics. In the year preceding Israel's last win in 2018, Palestinian deaths at the hands of Israel Forces in the Occupied West Bank and Gaza -- a total of 66 -- was lower than in every previous year, bar one, since the year 2000.\n\nIn 1979, Israel hosting the competition in Jerusalem won for the second year in a row with the song \"Hallelujah\". The victory took place just five days after the signing of the Israeli-Egypt peace treaty on March 31, proof perhaps that the fortunes of Israeli Eurovision entries are not unrelated to the Israeli Palestinian conflict.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the bookies have called the odds on this year's competition right, and whether the expected backlash to the Israel entry will materialize onstage or off in Malmo or indeed in the living rooms of the voting public across Europe.\n\nOf course, the public cannot vote against any one country, and minority vocal pro-Israeli sentiment may in fact play an unexpected outsized role in the voting this year.\n\nCroatia remain the favourites, with Ukraine once again, battling it out, according to the bookies, for a top five position.\n\nIt's worth noting that Russia was ejected from the competition in 2022, and remains banned, not because it invaded Ukraine, per se, but because the state broadcasters were deemed to have flouted EBU \"membership obligations\" in part because the same Russian state broadcasters were accused of having acted as mouth pieces for the regime's actions in Ukraine.\n\nIt would appear nobody in the EBU HQ has been watching Israel's state broadcaster, Kan, and its coverage of the Israeli war on Gaza on Israeli television Channel 11.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType":

Meet the Moldova Eurovision 2024 entry", "body": "With the song Fight, Barbu brought Moldova all the way to tenth place with 109 points. But the country's best result was from 2017, where SunStroke Project came second with their song Hey Mamma.\n\nYet, Natalia is hoping that it'll be second time lucky as she gears up for the competition at Malm\u00f6 Arena in Sweden. This year, the contest takes place between 7th and 11th May.\n\nBut who is Natalia Barbu? Does she have what it takes to bring Moldova to victory? Here's everything that we know.\n\nMulti-talented Natalia Barbu isn't just a singer-songwriter: she's also a composer and violinist. She's spent a lot of her career working closely with experimental folk/jazz band Trigon, and has released a total of 20 singles and four studio albums.\n\nAs well as representing Moldova in 2007, Natalia participated in the Romanian national selection for 2013's Eurovision with the song Confession. So it's safe to say she definitely knows her stuff.\n\nMoldova came 18th overall with 96 points. Pasha Parfeni performed the song Soarele \u0219i Luna.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_colombo@radiotimes.com", "name": "Charlotte Colombo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Barbu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natalia Barbu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moldova"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Moldova"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunStroke_Project", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SunStroke Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6 Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Experimental music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Composer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Violin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/04/Natalia-Barbu-2-da669d7.png?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "dateEnd": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 357, "textEnd": 373}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

It and a second semifinal on Thursday will winnow a field of 37 nations to 26 who will compete in Saturday's final against a backdrop of both parties and protests.\n\nAmong the 15 acts performing Tuesday are Croatian singer-songwriter Baby Lasagna, whose infectious electro number \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" is the current favorite to win, and Ukrainian duo alyona alyona and Jerry Heil, flying the flag for their war-battered nation with the anthemic \"Teresa & Maria.\"\n\nOther bookmakers' favorites include nonbinary Swiss singer Nemo, goth-style Irish singer Bambi Thug, Italian TikTok star Angelina Mango and the Netherlands' Joost Klein with the playful pop-rap song \"Europapa.\"\n\nSecurity is tight in the Swedish city, which expects an influx of some 100,000 Eurovision fans, along with tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters. Israel is a Eurovision participant, and demonstrations are planned on Thursday and Saturday against the Israel-Hamas war, which has left almost 35,000 Palestinians dead.\n\nIsrael's government warned its citizens of a \"tangible concern\" Israelis could be targeted for attack in Malmo during the contest.\n\nOrganizers told Israel to change the lyrics of its entry, originally titled \"October Rain\" in apparent reference to Hamas' cross-border Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and triggered the war. The song was renamed \"Hurricane\" and Israeli singer Eden Golan was allowed to remain in the contest.\n\nJean Philip De Tender, deputy director-general of Eurovision organizer the European Broadcasting Union, told Sky News that banning Israel \"would have been a political decision, and as such (one) which we cannot take.\"\n\nPolice from across Sweden have been drafted in for Eurovision week, along with reinforcements from neighboring Denmark and Norway.\n\nSweden's official terrorism threat level remains \"high,\" the second-highest rung on a five-point scale, after a string of public desecrations of the Quran last year sparked angry demonstrations across Muslim countries and threats from militant groups. The desecrations were not related to the music event.\n\nEurovision's motto is \"United by Music,\" but national rifts and political divisions often cloud the contest despite organizers' efforts to keep politics out.\n\nFlags and signs are banned, apart from participants' national flags and the rainbow pride flag. That means Palestinian flags will be barred inside the Malmo Arena contest venue.\n\nPerformers are feeling political pressure, with some saying they have been inundated with messages on social media urging them to boycott the event.\n\n\"I am being accused, if I don't boycott Eurovision, of being an accomplice to genocide in Gaza,\" Germany's contestant, Isaak, said in an interview published by broadcaster ZDF. He said he did not agree.\n\n\"We are meeting up to make music, and when we start shutting people out categorically, there will be fewer and fewer of us,\" he said. \"At some point there won't be an event anymore.\"\n\nOne person who knows how Eurovision unity can collide with bitter reality is singer Manizha Sangin, who represented Russia at the contest in 2021. The country was expelled the following year over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nManizha, who performs under her first name, spoke out against the war. As a result, her performances were canceled in Russia and her music banned from public spaces. The singer remains in Russia but has found it all but impossible to work.\n\n\"People are afraid to work with me here because they're afraid to have consequences after, problems after that,\" she said.\n\nDespite the difficulties, Manizha has recorded a single, \"Candlelight,\" which she is releasing on Wednesday as \"a message of hope.\"\n\n\"Music cannot stop war,\" she said. But \"what music can do is inspire people.\"\n\nManizha thinks Russia will one day return to the Eurovision fold - but not soon.\n\n\"Maybe next generation,\" she said. \"But for now, relationships are too complicated. And then that makes me sad, you know, because that's why people are not hearing each other. Because we are separated from each other. And the thing, is music should unite.\"\n\n___\n\nLawless reported from London. Associated Press writers Stephen Graham in Berlin, Hilary Fox in London and Jan M.

Here's how!", "body": "The countdown is on. Starting at 9pm Tuesday evening, Tali, Luxembourg's representative, will face off against 14 other competitors in the first Eurovision semi-final in Malm\u00f6.\n\nFifteen countries, including Luxembourg, will compete on 7 May in the first semi-final of this year's Eurovision Song Contest at the Malm\u00f6 Arena. Only 10 will continue to the finale on Saturday night.\n\nPerforming with the evening's second round of competitors, the final contender in tonight's contest will be Luxembourg's own Tali.\n\nThe first semi-final will be broadcast live with English commentary on RTL Today this Tuesday 7 May. To place your vote, a link via www.esc.vote will take you directly to the Eurovision voting page for Luxembourg.\n\nThis bespoke voting page is where you can vote for your favourite performance; it will automatically provide the correct voting methods for eligible countries.\n\nAt the semi-finals, it's up to the audience and spectators to decide which contestants will qualify for the final.\n\nDuring the Eurovision Song Contest Final, the producers' votes count just as much as those from the audience. The jury and the public each award 58 points -- from 1 to 12 points -- for the 10 best songs.\n\nThis year, voters from countries not taking part in the Eurovision final will also be able to vote. They will award 58 points, just like any participating country. In the event of a tie between two or more countries, the public will decide.\n\nIn the semi-final, voting only starts once the last song has been performed on stage, and will remain open for around 15 to 25 minutes.\n\nFor Saturday night's final, voting starts as soon as the first song begins, and remains open for around 25 to 40 minutes after the last performer has taken to the stage.\n\nFor each semi-final, only 10 artists will qualify for the final. As mentioned, tonight and Thursday's semi-finals will be 'audience only' votes -- and only for the contestants performing on that evening.\n\nSimilarly, the 'Big Five' (Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy) as well as the host country, Sweden, cannot be chosen. They're already in the final.\n\nOne vote will cost you 0.99 euro. Payment can be made by credit card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. A credit card is necessary to cast your vote and you can vote a maximum of 20 times per registered credit card.

Only ten countries from each show will progress to the grand final which means 17 representatives will be axed.\n\nThis year has seen some massive changes implemented.

Last year, the contest confirmed a jury vote would no longer be implemented in the semi-final results which means the acts will be judged entirely by televote.

Every year they get a pass to the final because of their contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The host nation joins The Big Five in progressing to the finals as a courtesy from the contest but this year all six countries will perform in the semi-finals.\n\nIn previous years, only a short clip of their rehearsal performances was shown during the semi-finals. In a historic move for the contest, the Big Five and the host nation will perform regardless of their already qualifying conditions as a way to evenly balance all of the acts in the eyes of the audience.\n\nEbba Adielsson, executive producer of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 said: \"We think that this change gives the Big Five countries and the host country a fairer playing field in the Grand Final, as they now have the opportunity to perform \"for real\" on stage in the semi-finals.\n\n\"It is also a win for both the audience in the arena and the viewers at home, in that they get to see all the acts competing this year live before the Grand Final.\"\n\nHow to vote\n\nViewers can cast their votes via the official Eurovision Song Contest app (or by following instructions on screen) during the live broadcast. The app is available for your iOS, Android or Windows device, and if you vote via the app you will receive a special video message from your favourite artists.\n\nOn Saturday, May 11, voting will open just before the first song is performed. Viewers at home will be able to cast their votes as the songs are performed, rather than waiting until all entries have been presented, as has been the case since public voting was introduced in 1997 (except in 2010 and 2011 when voting also began at the start of the show).\n\nAdditionally, fans in non-participating countries will now have nearly 24 hours to vote for their favourite songs before each of the live shows begin. Online voting will open for the rest of the world opens immediately after the second dress rehearsal for each Semi-Final and Grand Final has finished the previous night, and will stay open until the live shows begin.\n\nReceive top stories on everything going on in Merseyside including events, shopping and food and drink through our newsletter by signing up here", "source": {"uri":

Could it be Olly this year? It doesn't take a genius to figure out why the BBC Eurovision selection committee almost bit off Olly Alexander's hand when he dropped them a line last summer. Lest we forget, these past decades, the Chernobyl Tourist Board has had more luck filling charter flights than we've had at getting actual pop stars to compete in the event.\n\nFormer pop stars? Well, that's a different story. Blue sang I Can in 2011, only to find that, actually, when it came to landing a top ten placing, they couldn't. Bonnie Tyler spent much of the 2013 final holding out for something more than a zero, finally scraping a paltry 23 points. Future pop stars? Sure, Sam Ryder became a household name in 2022 thanks to his cosmological cri de coeur, Space Man. But when newly solo Years & Years frontman Olly Alexander takes to the stage in Malmo this Saturday to sing Dizzy, he will do so as someone whose band's most-recent album, Night Call, landed at number one in the first of its 23-week run in the UK charts.\n\nTo understand why Eurovision can now attract a pop star at the top of his game, we need to step back and look at what, almost by stealth, Eurovision has become over the past 25 years.\n\nA tournament that was once a byword for naffness, synonymous with sexless balladeering, baffling schlager ditties and cabaret corn, has become the music television event of the year. In the UK last year, it secured its highest audience share since records began, while over in Sweden almost a third of the population saw their country triumph with Loreen's pneumatic power ballad, Tattoo.\n\nThe staging of the event has evolved to mirror its growing importance, with this year's production designers having worked on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour and Abba Voyage. What you'll see when you tune in is the most ambitious presentation the contest has ever seen: a cross-shaped stage positioned in the middle of the Malmo Arena made up of moveable LED cubes and floors.\n\nRight at the centre of that revolution is the music itself. As we go to press, the bookmakers' favourite is Swiss offering The Code by singing, rapping, violin-playing force of nature Nemo, in which they detail the turbulent journey to realising their non-binary identity.\n\nAlso in the frame is Croatia's Baby Lasagna, whose stirring immigration anthem Rim Tim Tagi Dim issues a powerful reminder that sublime and ridiculous don't have to sleep in separate beds. \"Ay, I'm a big boy now,\" intones the Croat poet. \"I'm going away and I sold my cow.\"\n\nWhen it comes to risk-taking pop, the Swiss and Croatian entries are by no means alone. As Eurovision memoirist William Lee Adams explains, \"More than any other year, Eurovision 2024 is a wild rodeo ride. You've got Angelina Mango from Italy singing Cumbia music with hot, spicy passion and then there's Joost from the Netherlands with Europapa, a bonkers but passionate anthem to free movement around Europe.\"\n\nPerhaps it's finally time to set aside our accumulated memories of the whimsical commentary box put-downs that came as standard in the days when Terry Wogan was our guide to the madness on stage. Just because we thought that Eurovision was naff, it didn't mean other countries felt that way.\n\nAccording to Dr Dean Vuletic, author of Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest, the very question itself says a lot about the way we still view ourselves, with perhaps a certain sense of entitlement when it comes to our status as a pop nation.\n\nHe mentions the response in 1968 when Cliff Richard's Congratulations lost out to Spain by just one point, prompting newspapers to imply that Spanish state television had rigged the vote on behalf of General Franco's fascist regime: \"All that soft power you didn't know you had, because you never lacked it? The visibility Britain had through its language and its pop culture - for other countries, there are few international platforms that allow them to have that same visibility.\"\n\nBy contrast, Vuletic talks about the way Abba's Waterloo suddenly amplified Sweden's reach after the 1974 contest. \"No country has done better out of Eurovision than Sweden with Abba. Prior to Abba, Sweden was not a power when it came to popular culture. Now its third-biggest export industry is popular music. And when you combine that with the soft power potential of companies such as H&M and Ikea, then that's pretty amazing.\"\n\nWhat Sweden seemed to realise accidentally with Abba's victory 50 years ago was something that the group themselves knew all along - that this could be the cannon that would blast them to huge international success. That when the world is watching, you need to supplant all their preconceptions about you and replace them with something way better.\n\nAbba studied the British pop charts and set about planning their moment like a world-class bank robber would plan a heist. Bjorn Ulvaeus recalls, \"I know that we wanted to pack it with energy. It's all energy, energy, energy. That was during the glam-rock era and groups like Slade and Sweet, those British bands... All those records were so full of energy. And we wanted to pack that much energy into Waterloo as well.\"\n\nIn a poll conducted by BBC One for the channel's 2020 TV special Eurovision: Come Together, Waterloo was voted the greatest Eurovision song of all time, followed by Conchita Wurst's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix.\n\nWhat does that tell us about what it takes to come up with a winning formula in 2024? Not much, according to Katrina Leskanich of Katrina and the Waves, whose Love Shine a Light was the last British winner, back in 1997.\n\n\"Was Love Shine a Light really the best song?\" ponders the singer, most remembered for her group's 1985 hit Walking on Sunshine. \"I'm not sure. I'll tell you something, though. It wasn't even written for Eurovision. It was written for the Swindon branch of Samaritans. Our drummer's brother worked there, and they needed a theme tune for their 50th-anniversary celebrations. So our guitarist Kimberley Rew wrote it and we shoved it in the bottom drawer, thinking it was too Eurovision to put on one of our records. So when we got an approach to submit a song, we submitted it.\"\n\nLeskanich remains proud of Love Shine a Light, but adds that \"so much of what happens depends on the night, on what all the other songs are. There was a good feeling about the UK that week, because Tony Blair had just come to power and he was hugely popular across Europe. All that stuff plays a part.\"\n\nIn other words, context and politics matter. Without it, would Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra have secured an outright win in 2022 for their entry Stefania? The prospect of three minutes broadcasting to an entire continent is a chance to influence the narrative - and occasionally, argues Adams, turn Eurovision into a propaganda tool.\n\nBy way of example, he cites A Million Voices, Russia's 2015 near-winner by Polina Gagarina - who subsequently became a prominent figure at pro-Putin rallies - which promoted the notion that Russia was a peacemaker in that part of the world. The uneasy truce in the old Soviet Union was something that didn't go unnoticed by Terry Wogan back in 2008, when Russia received 12 points from Ukraine. In remarks that now seem prescient, he muttered: \"Ukraine just want to be sure that the old electricity and the oil flows through.\"\n\n\"Anyone who feels that politics has no place in Eurovision probably hasn't been paying that much attention,\" says Adams when asked about calls from Swedish musicians such as Robyn and First Aid Kit to exclude Israel's Eden Golan from this year's contest. Golan's song was originally called October Rain and featured lyrics directly referencing Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, but was rejected by the Eurovision Broadcasting Union, prompting a new lyric that now answers to the name of Hurricane.\n\nEurovision has always, to a greater or lesser extent, acted as a detailed tapestry of what's happening across the continent at any given time. That has been a constant going back to the very first contest in 1956, when West Germany fielded an entry by Holocaust survivor Walter Andreas Schwarz with a self-composed autobiographical song in the chanson style whose title translates as Luckily in the Waiting Room.\n\nSo how best to think of Eurovision and the place it holds in the collective psyche? Rather like Camp chicory coffee and those people who walk around pubs with a tray of seafood, if we didn't already have it, no one would invent it. It's a space that exists to be claimed by anyone who needs it badly enough. And since 1998, when Dana International emerged victorious with Diva, the biggest driver of Eurovision's resurgence has been the visibility of LGBTQ+ singers in the contest.\n\nThe sight of the Israeli singer emerging victorious that May night had an unforgettable effect on the then nine-year-old Rylan, watching in Stepney, east London. \"I didn't entirely understand why it was such a big deal,\" recalls the Radio 2 presenter, who was a member of the UK's song selection committee this year. \"But then to find out, obviously, that Dana was trans... my brain was a bit, like, 'Oh, so that woman has not always been a woman'. That was my first connection with Eurovision, seeing everyone talking about it. It was fun, but also there was a sort of gravity to that moment.\"\n\nThe success of Diva is a splash whose ripples continue to push outwards and was followed by winning turns from Serbia's Marija Serifovic in 2007 and Austria's Conchita Wurst in 2014.\n\nIf anything, then, it feels overdue that finally in 2024 Britain gets to be represented in Eurovision by an LGBTQ+ singer. Russell T Davies, who selected Olly Alexander as the lead in his 2021 Channel 4 drama It's a Sin, says: \"Look, I'm biased, I love the man. And I'm fascinated to see how much his appeal transcends borders. There's something so unusual about Olly, something shifting and elemental. He's like a sprite. Or a devil. I never quite know what's going on in his eyes. I wonder how that'll come across on a tough, huge production like Eurovision.\n\n\"I worry that big, huge voices win on the night. He's more interesting than that. But Eurovision keeps changing - just when you think it's all about big ballads and key changes, along comes Netta [the defiantly outlandish Israeli 2018 winner]. So my hopes are high!\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAlexander himself says he has \"put all thoughts of winning to one side\". Expectation management is wise at this stage. Although the surging happy-sad Europop of Dizzy will surely see his star rise across Europe - with a projected 200 million streams of the song on just that one night - current betting doesn't have Alexander right up there with the leaders. But as Rylan points out, \"A lot can change in the fortnight leading up to the contest. Staging is definitely a factor.\"\n\nRegardless of what happens on the night, as Alexander says, \"It really isn't about coming first. So many Eurovision moments that have stayed with me and inspired me happened with songs that didn't even go beyond the semi-finals. That's not what it's about.\"\n\nSo what is it ultimately about? \"It's not real life,\" says Adams. \"It's the opposite. For three minutes on the Eurovision stage, everything is perfect. This is a moment where you can put aside all the drama, all the trauma, sing your heart out and be appreciated. Because every Eurovision performance - whether it's difficult, whether it's easy - ends with applause.\"\n\nThe new issue of Radio Times magazine is out now - subscribe to Radio Times here.",

Never mind the show-stopping performances, it all comes down to the climactic section when first the jury voters are added up, only for the scoreboard to be totally rearranged by the addition of the public votes that can change everything.\n\nThirty-seven entries are competing in this 64th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden and 26 of those will be going all-out to win in the Grand Final. These include the UK, one of the Big Five nations that make the biggest financial contribution to the event.\n\nOlly Alexander, lead singer of Years And Years, has been chosen as the UK's representative with his dance number Dizzy, performed with rotating cameras to create a mind-bending piece of musical mesmerism. Fans think it stands a good chance of being on the better side of the board but with the UK currently pegged as 50/1 outsiders by bookies, Alexander certainly has his work cut out for him.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nEurovision 2024 full guide to dates, times, how to watch and how to vote UK Foreign Office issues travel warning ahead of Eurovision as journeys 'may be affected' Birmingham Pride loses \u00a315k sponsorship as funds pulled by 'bankrupt' city council\n\nSo has Brexit really affected our chances and relegated us to be the forever outsiders? Statistician Charlie Mullan has delved into the UK's Eurovision history since the inaugural contest in Switzerland in 1956. He said: \"When the UK voted to withdraw from the European Union, many pundits wondered whether this would have an impact on Eurovision voting. The answer is: not really.\n\n\"The UK's decline in Eurovision had started long before the referendum on June 23, 2016. In the six years since Brexit, the UK has received a total of 428 votes (not including televotes), 194 more than in the six contests before the referendum. Four countries - Albania, Israel and fellow Big Five countries France and Germany have given the UK 18 points each in those six years since the historic vote - the most of any of the countries.\"\n\n\"Andorra, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Turkey have not given the UK a point since Brexit but they have not had a chance to because they have not participated. Belarus and Russia each have had three opportunities to award the UK points, but they failed to do so. However, it must be noted that both those countries are not participating this year.\"\n\nHe added: \"As the UK has discovered over the years, it often doesn't matter how good their songs might be, they just won't get the votes needed to be successful.\n\n\"Political voting plays a massive role in the Eurovision Song Contest and for whatever reason, the UK struggles to win friends and votes across Europe. Ireland's jury has been the most generous towards the UK with 205 total points given over the years, with Austria second. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the jury from Belarus has only given the UK six points, one fewer than Montenegro, before the televoting kicks in.\"\n\nSo who will get the UK's votes this year?\n\nOne of the UK's favourite countries over the last 10 years has been Sweden, says Charlie. There has always been a strong connection between the two countries throughout the history of the contest.\n\nThe UK jury has given more points to Sweden (222) than any other nation, although the Scandinavian country has only sent 145 points in the opposite direction. In the last eight contests, Sweden has been awarded maximum points from the UK three times, including in the last two competitions.\n\nCharlie points out: \"However, it's been a while since Sweden returned the favour - the last time they gave the UK 12 points was back in 1997, which coincidentally was also the last time the UK won. Australia, who joined the competition in 2015, has also fared well with the UK, receiving three scores of 10. These trends are expected to continue this year.\"\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp. Join our dedicated community to get the latest updates.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk",

This year is different.", "body": "Alex Abad-Santos is a senior correspondent who explains what society obsesses over, from Marvel and movies to fitness and skin care. He came to Vox in 2014. Prior to that, he worked at the Atlantic.\n\nFor taxonomic purposes, Eurovision is an international song contest. Technically, the European Broadcast Union (EBU) created the event in 1956 to foster post-WWII European unity, but has largely expanded beyond that function and Europe itself, with countries like Australia and Israel participating. The closest reference point for people in the US is American Idol, the extremely popular reality television singing contest that once crowned national treasure Kelly Clarkson.\n\nThink: polarizing and sometimes very disparate musical acts from each represented country, a public vote, and a night of live performances, but with the added elements like spooky Austrian comedy and whispers of devious Swedish sabotage.\n\nIs there any better way to symbolically present peace than getting in costume and singing a silly pop song in a lighthearted musical competition? What if I told you that there is no prize money for the winning country's band -- only bragging rights, a trophy, and national hosting duties for the next Eurovision?\n\nThere is absolutely nothing like Eurovision.\n\nWith nothing and seemingly everything on the line, Eurovision has become an international spectacle, perhaps the international spectacle aside from the Olympics. It's a fantasy that both undergirds and undermines everything you think you know about Europe and pop music. But as we gear up for another chapter of ostentatious music acts sing-fighting for zero money, the biggest story heading into this week's (May 7 to May 11) contest in Malmo, Sweden, threatens that escapist reputation. Protests over Israel's participation have punctuated the lead-up to the event, with activists asserting that Israel should be barred, given its military assault in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands.\n\nIt's far from the first time that politics and war have made their mark on the proceedings, but now Eurovision faces a huge question over its existence, its history, and who is and isn't allowed to take part in a competition that's supposed to really be about European novelty.\n\nEurovision usually bends toward more conventional, meaningful winners like last year's Loreen (who has won twice), 2016's Jamala, and 2021's M\u00e5neskin. ABBA and Celine Dion have also won the competition, and are its most famous alums. This year the UK's Olly Alexander, from the successful pop band Years & Years, seems like a ringer.\n\nBut the winners only tell part of Eurovision's story. Eurovision can feel vaguely psychedelic, which is what makes it a joy to behold. And the contest is at its best when it leans into unmitigated absurdity and the unexpected.\n\nTake, for example, Austria's 2023 entry: \"Who the Hell is Edgar?\" by Teya & Salena. The female duo met on Starmania, a talent show in their native country, and wrote \"Who The Hell is Edgar?\" to address \"an industry that all too often doesn't give women enough credit for their hard work and expertise,\" according to the official Eurovision website.\n\nSo how did Teya and Salena use their talents to discuss an industry that overlooks the female experience?\n\n\"Who the Hell is Edgar?\" is about Teya and Salena being possessed by the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe. Yes, that Edgar Allan Poe. Instead of writing another short story like \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" or \"The Raven,\" Poe has commandeered their bodies to write a fantastic pop song that they believe will make them rich and famous. At one point in the tune, a spooky pop polka, the two wish that they could wrangle Shakespeare and get him to ghostwrite an even bigger hit. But alas, because it's so hard to make money in the music business -- they sing that they can only make \"$0.003\" per listen -- not even these famous ghosts could make the women stars.\n\nPop music today doesn't usually make room for the kind of camp storytelling that characterizes \"Who the hell is Edgar?\" but it works in Eurovision. There, weirdness and cheekiness is celebrated. This is, after all, a competition that has had entries like DJ BoBo's \"Vampires Are Alive\" (Switzerland) and Verka Serduchka's \"Dancing Lasha Tumbai\" (Ukraine), a techno-inflected pop-folk number where the performers looked like someone zapped The Wizard of Oz's Tin Man with a Liberace laser beam:\n\nAs my colleague Zack Beauchamp has previously detailed, voting is split between a popular call-in vote from the public and a jury that consists of music industry professionals from each participating country. Thirty-seven participants will compete in semifinal rounds -- beginning on May 7 -- in hopes of qualifying for one of the 26 total spots in the grand final on May 11.\n\nJury voting is like Olympic judging, with each country giving out a maximum of 12 points (and all the way down to one) to the twelve best of the night in the grand finale.\n\nSometimes, the jury vote -- the vote from music professionals -- doesn't exactly coincide with the televote. Last year, the judges picked Loreen from Sweden's \"Tattoo\", while the public selected K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4 from Finland's \"Cha Cha Cha\" as the best of the night. The jury placed Finland fourth, which spawned a conspiracy theory about rigging Sweden's win so the country could host in 2024, the 50th anniversary of when ABBA won.\n\nThe low-ish stakes make for a fun bit of drama, but the disconnect between the jury and the popular vote has led to questions about why the jury votes have as much sway as the millions of calls coming through. Perhaps they shouldn't; the winner would likely be a little more out of the box if the more conventional jury votes didn't carry equal weight.\n\nSweden's alleged rigging is also not unlike some previous bits of Eurovision history, like the time Switzerland picked noted Canadian Celine Dion to represent the famously neutral country in 1988. Rules at the time did not specify that a singer had to be born in the country they represented, and Dion was a burgeoning star internationally. Dion, of course, won the whole thing.\n\nThat said, while Eurovision is a \"competition\" and a winner is crowned, megastars like ABBA and Dion are exceptional exceptions of Eurovision victors. Eurovision winners don't usually become worldwide superstars. The list of winners -- 1982's Nicole? 2002's Marie N? 2006's Lordi -- are probably blue Wikipedia links for normies. That should underscore the idea that Eurovision is really about the entertainment of the night, the stunts, the scintillating swing for the fences, rather than the actual score.\n\nAhead of the competition in Malmo, the lead-up to Eurovision this year has been a series of protests and proposed boycotts against Israel's participation in this year's competition. The gist: Israel should not be allowed to participate in Eurovision because of its continued attacks in Gaza. A country at war shouldn't perform at an event about unity and peace.\n\nThe opposition to Israel's inclusion -- Israel has participated in Eurovision since 1973 -- isn't without precedent. Critics of Israel's participation point out that just two years ago, Eurovision disallowed Russia in a similar situation.\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Eurovision banned Russia a day after its invasion of Ukraine. At the time state broadcasters from participating countries like Iceland, Finland, Norway, and The Netherlands called for Russia's ban, which the EBU ultimately granted, citing Eurovision's mission to protect \"the values of a cultural competition which promotes international exchange and understanding\" and saying that the event \"unites Europe on one stage.\"\n\nSpeaking on the ban, Eurovision's executive supervisor Martin \u00d6sterdahl said that Russia's exclusion was a decision about upholding the core values of democracy and human rights core to the event's spirit. \"When we say we are not political, what we always should stand up for are the basic and ultimate values of democracy. Everyone is right to be who they are,\" he said in December 2022.\n\nSince then, Russia has suspended its EBU membership and has not returned to the competition.\n\nEarlier this year, more than 1,000 Swedish artists called for Israel's ban. Similarly, Finnish and Icelandic musicians have also called on Eurovision to block Israel's entry, stating that by allowing their participation \"a country that commits war crimes and continues a military occupation is given a public stage to polish its image in the name of music.\" Fans are also making pleas to Eurovision participants not to compete this year because of Israel's participation, and Sweden has ramped up security in anticipation of protests.\n\nYet, the ongoing protests and calls for action haven't convinced the EBU or Eurovision organizers. A young singer named Eden Golan will represent Israel and sing \"Hurricane.\" The song's original rejected title was \"October Rain,\" a not-so-veiled reference to the October 7 Hamas attacks. EBU officials rejected the title and asked Israel to alter the song before re-entry.\n\n\"I think it's important for Israel to appear in Eurovision, and this is also a statement because there are haters who try to drive us off every stage,\" Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, said in February. Before altering its lyrics, Israel had threatened to withdraw from the competition.\n\nAccording to EBU Director General Noel Curran, Eurovision is a competition between international broadcasters and not the countries themselves. \"It is not a contest between governments,\" he said, adding that though the EBU and Eurovision made a decision on Russia, it was not going to do so for Israel.\n\n\"Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make,\" he said.\n\nWhile Curran insists that the contest will be apolitical, its actions might not be interpreted as such. Palestinian flags will not be allowed at the competition nor will any pro-Palestinian symbols or signs referring to Israel and Hamas's war. The Israeli flag will be allowed because it's a member state and only participants' flags are permitted, with the exception being rainbow and LGBTQ flags.\n\nThe rules of what's allowed to be shown and who's allowed to support whom make for a jumbled message. Obviously no one expected Eurovision to solve the crisis in the Middle East. But in an attempt to appear apolitical and actively not reference the bloodshed, Eurovision organizers have made their decisions difficult to ignore and this event even harder to enjoy.", "source":

Over 1,000 Swedish artists called for Israel to be banned this year, such as Robyn, Fever Ray, and First Aid Kit, whilst over 1,400 Finnish music industry professionals recently signed a petition to ban the country from taking part in the contest as well.\n\nIn the buildup to the 2024 edition, individual artists such as Olly Alexander also faced calls to boycott the event. Alexander, the UK's entry this year, initially signed a statement last December calling Israel an \"apartheid state\" and accusing it of genocide.\n\nIsrael's entry also proved controversial. Originally titled 'October Rain', the song - performed by Eden Golan - appeared to contain references to the victims of Hamas' October 7 attacks and was barred from performance due to breaking rules on political neutrality. Israel was finally confirmed to compete after changes were made to the lyrics and the song's title was changed to 'Hurricane'.\n\nNow, organisers have doubled down on their stance saying that to exclude Israeli broadcaster Kan from the competition would have been a \"political decision\".\n\nSpeaking on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips on Sky News, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: \"I fully agree it is a family event and the great thing about this music competition is that it's all about values. It's about uniting onstage all of these young talents, these participants, and they do great. It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules. If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nDe Tender also added that the EBU, an apolitical member organisation, is \"in line\" with other international federations including sports bodies who are allowing Israel to participate in events.\n\nIt comes after Eurovision organisers also recently confirmed that that they reserve the right to remove Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols during the contest.\n\nTicket buyers will only be allowed to display the flags of competing countries - including Israel - and the Pride flag.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrations are expected to take place in protest of Israel's controversial participation in the contest following the current tensions with Hamas that have been ongoing since October. Protesters are expected to gather in downtown Malm\u00f6, several miles from the arena where Eurovision will be held.\n\nMore than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed and more than 77,000 wounded in Israel's current military operation, according to Gaza's Hamas-controlled health ministry, reports Sky News.\n\nAround 1,200 Israelis were killed in the October 7 attacks.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "damian_jones@nme.com", "name": "Damian Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycotts_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycotts of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karin_Dreijer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karin Dreijer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Aid_Kit_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Aid Kit (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel and apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_flag_(LGBT)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rainbow flag (LGBT)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Contests", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Eurovision-2024-Stage-design.-Credit-Peppe-Andersson_SVT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 275, "textEnd": 281}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1055, "textEnd": 1064, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

This semi-final, along with a second one scheduled for Thursday, will narrow down the 37 participating nations to 26 finalists who will compete in Saturday's grand finale amid a backdrop of both celebration and protests.\n\nTen out of the first semi-final's 15 acts were voted through to the final by viewers. Among them is Croatian singer-songwriter Baby Lasagna, whose infectious electro number \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" is currently a favourite to win, alongside Ukrainian duo alyona alyona and Jerry Heil, representing their embattled nation with the anthemic \"Teresa & Maria.\"\n\nAlso making the cut were goth-style Irish singer Bambie Thug, 1990s-loving Finnish prankster Windows95man, Portuguese crooner Iolanda, along with the entries from Cyprus, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Serbia, and Slovenia.\n\nIceland, Azerbaijan, Poland, Moldova and Australia were eliminated.\n\nIt didn't take long for the first on-stage pro-Palestinian protest to happen. Former Swedish Eurovision contestant Eric Saade, who wasn't competing, wore a traditional Middle Eastern keffiyeh scarf, which has become an international symbol of pro-Palestinian sentiment, around his wrist during the opening performance.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has stated: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show. All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nSaade, whose father is of Palestinian origin, has criticised the EBU's management of this year's controversy and has consistently expressed his opposition to Israel's participation in the competition.\n\nThe EBU, the organising body of the contest, has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded from the competition. However, it did order Israel to change the lyrics of its competing song, originally titled 'October Rain', as it was seen as a reference to Hamas' cross-border Oct. 7 attack.\n\nThe song was renamed \"Hurricane\" and Israeli singer Eden Golan was allowed to remain in the contest.\n\nJean Philip De Tender, deputy director-general of Eurovision organiser the European Broadcasting Union, told Sky News that banning Israel \"would have been a political decision, and as such (one) which we cannot take.\"\n\nSecurity is tight in the Swedish city, which expects an influx of some 100,000 Eurovision fans, along with tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters. Demonstrations are planned on Thursday and Saturday against the Israel-Hamas war, which has left almost 35,000 Palestinians dead.\n\nFlags and signs are banned, apart from participants' national flags and the rainbow pride flag.

This year's Eurovision Song Contest starts today. On Thursday, Israeli Eden Golan enters the Malmo Theater in the second semi-final, to perform the song \"Hurricane.\" On stage there is a performance, and in the background there is noise from the Israeli war on Gaza. But many who thought this was inappropriate, so inappropriate that Israel should have been excluded from the competition, did not win. Why not?\n\nLet's look at the difficult term \"political\". The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the union of public broadcasters that organizes the Eurovision Song Contest, wants more than anything else in the world to keep politics out of the competition.\n\nIt is clearly an illusion. The Eurovision Song Contest has always been political, even if here in the safe North West we're sometimes allowed to forget that. In many countries, especially those behind the Iron Curtain, participation in the Eurovision Song Contest is a heavy symbol. It's the sign that you live in a Western European country that is your equal.\n\nTake Estonia for example. When the country won the final in Copenhagen in 2001, there was public celebration for several days. Prime Minister Mart Lahr declared: \"We have liberated ourselves from the Soviet Union through song. Now we will sing our way to Europe.\"\n\nOr take Bosnia and Herzegovina, which first participated as an independent state in 1993. At that time, there was a full-blown civil war in the former Yugoslavia. The Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, was under siege, and the artists who were to take part in the final in Ireland were forced to flee the city in the middle of the night. They were shot.\n\nThe singer told the BBC many years later how he lost his shoes and had to run barefoot through the snow. What he remembers most is the feeling of doing something important. And the fact that it is also entertainment means nothing.\n\n\"We were the first to show our independence and prove it,\" he said. \"We were the first to represent Bosnia at the international level. We proved that our country exists.\"\n\nHowever, the EBU is trying everything it can to keep politics out. If the songs are too political, the lyrics should be changed. This may be necessary. Politics is by nature divisive. It is about power, conflicts, issues about which people disagree, and different visions for the future of countries and continents. Anyone who wants to create a unified event must be able to create a space where such conflicts are left at the door.\n\nBut then come situations in which the non-political becomes political. Not taking a position is no longer seen as neutral or inclusive. In Eurovision's recent history, twice have countries been banned in ways that may be related to this year's unrest.\n\nThe first was when Yugoslavia and Slobodan broke up Milo\u0161evi\u0107The Belgrade government went to war against the breakaway states. This banned Yugoslavia, what remained, from participating in the Eurovision Song Contest for twelve years, before participating again in 2004 as Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nBut it was just a formality that made it possible to keep the country out. The Yugoslav Broadcasting Corporation was dissolved in 1992, and when a new body was created, it was not allowed to join the European Broadcasting Union due to international sanctions imposed on the country. Milo\u0161evi\u0107Q system.\n\nIt is perhaps natural, then, to compare the discussion around Israel to Russia's exclusion in 2022. Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, it became known that the country would not be allowed to participate in Eurovision. It was not long before the European Union announced that Russia would be allowed to participate as usual.\n\nWhen they backed down, it seemed as if they had given in to pressure. Norway was then among the countries that requested the expulsion of Russia, along with Finland, Iceland and the Netherlands. Finland said it would not send any contribution to the final if Russia was allowed to participate.\n\nMany protesters this year point to this story. They raise questions about the reasons that prompted individual Member States to take this position two years ago, but not now. But for decision makers, attitudes may still be different.\n\nBecause it was not only the reactions of some member states that were decisive in 2022. In the period following the invasion of Ukraine, there was a wave of sanctions from the West. After some hectic talks and negotiations, a united Europe severed its political and cultural ties with Putin's Russia. Before UEFA could reach its decision, the country lost the UEFA Champions League final, which was moved to Paris. Not participating in the Russia boycott would likely seem more like active political activity, and more of a position taken, than participating.\n\nIn both Ukraine and Gaza, innocent civilians are dying in large numbers. For organizations that have to decide on the wars, punishing Russia may still be less complicated than imposing sanctions on Israel. It comes down to several things.\n\nNRK management has indicated that the Israel Broadcasting Corporation, not the State of Israel, is a member of the European Broadcasting Union. This radio is considered independent from the Israeli state, which cannot be said about the Russian media.\n\nIt also has a relationship with society and politics in general. Broadcasters are independent, but they are still reluctant to pursue their own policy that goes against what might be called the broad political consensus. To date, there is no widespread boycott of Israel in Western European countries, although many strong voices have called for it.\n\nIf including Russia had been seen as a \"political\" matter, it would likely have been seen as more \"political\" to exclude Israel. There will be talk of entering into a conflict that will extend for several decades. Perhaps it will be difficult on a continent with a dark history with the Holocaust, and which has a Jewish minority to care for.", "source": {"uri": "brytfmonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Eurovision 2024 bangers to watch out for", "body": "From a man with a mullet letting off fireworks to a Slovenian witch, this year's Eurovision has some of the wildest entries ever. It makes our own entry look rather bland ...\n\nThe bookies' favourite, and you can see why. For one thing, it addresses a hot-button social issue - the lyrics deal with Nemo Mettler's non-binary gender identity - that's also very Eurovision-friendly. In 1998, Eurovision had a transgender winner, Dana International, 34 years before Kim Petras became the first transgender woman to top the UK and US chart with Unholy. More importantly, it's that rare thing, an original-sounding Eurovision entry that's charmingly preposterous rather than straight-up daft - its drum'n'bass-influenced rhythm interrupted by high-drama mock-operatics and a vocal that shifts from rapping to falsetto melodrama. You could imagine it in the UK singles chart, which is something one seldom feels with Eurovision songs.\n\nSelf-conscious wackiness has triumphed at Eurovision before - clearly people thought Netta's performance of 2018's winner Toy, complete with chicken noises and much gurning to camera, was endearing, rather than wildly infuriating - so why not the be-mulleted Windows95man, who emerges from what appears to be a giant papier-mache egg, performs in his pants and sings in a voice that sounds like a cross between HP Baxxter of German pop-techno titans Scooter and a heavy metal \"death growl\"? In fact, he leaves most of the heavy vocal lifting on the pacy No Rules! to someone else, while he gets on with the more important business of waving fireworks around.\n\nDon't be fooled by the fact he's called Baby Lasagna, his habit of posting TikTok videos dressed as a Balkan answer to Ken from the Barbie movie, or indeed the none-more-Eurovision Boom-Bang-a-Bang-esque title. Rim Tim Tagi Dim deals with the exodus of young Croatians for better opportunities abroad - \"I'm going away and I sold my cow!\" Its combination of high camp and national pride, synthesisers and hard rock is charming. Moreover, it's based on a three note riff that, once heard, is basically impossible to dislodge from your brain without recourse to cognitive therapy.\n\nIreland has form with oddball Eurovision winners - Eimear Quinn's Kate Bush and Enya-inspired The Voice in 1996 - while the success of Lordi and M\u00e5neskin proves hard rock sometimes triumphs. Hence wraith-like gothette Bambie Thug's Doomsday Blue, which is all over the place: feedback-strafed metal one minute, a vocal that recalls Napoleon XIV's 1966 novelty hit They're Coming to Take Me Away Ha-Haaa! the next, then pounding industrial noise, followed by plinky-plonk acoustic guitar and Amy Winehouse-ish emoting. It perhaps amounts to Trying A Bit Too Hard, but that's definitely better than not trying hard enough.\n\nAlready stars in their homeland - the members (\"two feminine brothers\" in their own words) are both refugees from the Australian version of The X Factor - no one can accuse Electric Fields of talking down to their Eurovision audience: partly sung in Indigenous Australian language Yankunytjatjara, One Milkali (One Blood)'s lyrics are based on, wait for it, non-integer positional numeral system the golden ratio base. Perhaps more importantly, it's a great song, with a classiness that sets it apart from the wilfully tacky end of Eurovision: mid-tempo funk topped off with hands-in-the-air house piano, and soaring anthemic chorus.\n\nReaders of a certain vintage may dimly remember the 1986 novelty hit Holiday Rap, in which MC Miker G and DJ Sven did their Amsterdam-accented thing over the Madonna hit of the same name: they were, you might recall, going to ring-a-rang-a-dang for a holiday. Something of their spirit seems to rest with Joost Klein, who raps too, albeit in Dutch and German, over that Eurovision staple, a knowing take on warp-speed pop-techno. A lyric about pan-national brotherhood and a touching backstory involving the young Joost promising his now-deceased parents that he would one day represent Holland in Eurovision should boost its chances on the night.\n\nStarts out sounding - rather unexpectedly - like Laurie Anderson's O Superman, but soon slips into an appealingly leftfield take on reggaeton, decorated with what sounds like tsampouna, or Greek bagpipes, sundry electronic bleeps and weird vocodered vocals. It's really good, but possibly too odd to do well. That said, if the official video, which opens with the words \"GREECE IS BLISS\", encourages the watching public to visit the land of my forefathers - and it does everything to entice tourists short of coming round their house with a plate of homemade kataifi - then one suspects the Hellenic Eurovision committee will go home happy.\n\nThe only British entrant who made a decent Eurovision showing in recent years was Sam Ryder, perhaps because his Bowie-and-Elton-influenced glam ballad Spaceman was different from the usual Eurovision fare. Amazingly, we subsequently reverted to our standard tactic of sending a slightly more pallid version of whatever's happening in the charts, with inevitable results. Which brings us to the Pet Shop Boys-influenced Dizzy: not a bad song, but not a great one either, and insufficiently sparky to stand out. It's hard not to feel a bit sorry for Alexander, who seems like a good egg, and piloted enough great pop singles with Years & Years to know Dizzy probably won't cut it.\n\nAh, the reliable pop hitmaking formula that is a song about the death of a 15th-century Slovenian woman (who was accused of witchcraft after secretly marrying the heir to the throne of Celje) as a metaphor for modern-day feminism. I know, I know: for pity's sake, not that old chestnut again. But before you consign Veronika to the already-teetering pile of songs involving feminist readings of 15th century witch trials in north-eastern Slovenia, note that, as big, melodramatic, fetch-the-wind-machine-she's-getting-to the-chorus Eurovision ballads go, Veronika is a pretty classy example, with a gothy undertone, some intriguingly odd chattering voices in its rhythm track and as much impassioned vibrato from Raiven as anyone could wish for.\n\nSan Marino has a chequered history in Eurovision: its entrants have only qualified three times, it twice failed to field a song at all owing to financial difficulties, and it's never placed higher than 19th. But God loves a trier, and 11:11 - by Spain's self-styled proponents of \"fucksia rock\" Megara, who one suspects have noted the way Eurovision catapulted M\u00e5neskin to international stardom - is pretty striking. It's closer to pop-punk than metal (which, given the vogue for pop-punk in the work of Olivia Rodrigo et al, makes it quite timely), with a lot of ridiculous onstage business involving dancing skeletons.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexis_petridis@theguardian.com", "name": "Alexis Petridis", "type": "author",

The Swedish city joined by an 8km bridge to Copenhagen, Denmark is the perfect host for the competition as a cosmopolitan borer town and due to Sweden's heritage as seven-times champion.\n\nWhat began as a parochial bit of light entertainment - a mystery to the remaining six continents, including some Europeans - the competition has since become a global phenomenon. Last year the competition in Liverpool attracted 162 million viewers, inspired an acclaimed feature film with Will Ferrell and tallied votes from 144 countries. Considering New Zealand cast the fifth-highest number of online votes last year outside of the 37 participating countries, it appears the competition has turned a new global audience on to eurotrash pop music.\n\nOr maybe they're just also in on the joke now.\n\nAs the Euros return to Sweden 50 years after Abba won with Waterloo - and prepare to enter an eighth decade of sequin-coated extravagance - it's worth pointing out the song competition goes back a lot further than that.\n\nThe competition was founded by Swiss broadcaster Marcel Bezen\u00e7on in 1956. Though sometimes divisive and often controversial, the song contest was founded to promote peace and unity in Europe, pitting countries against each other in friendly competition, less than a decade after the end of World War II. A less idealistic motive was to test new live television broadcast equipment with a relatively cheap-to-produce variety show.\n\nIt was supposedly inspired by the Sanremo Song Competition, although the 1950s song contest held in the casino close to Monte Carlo had a very different vibe to today's TV extravaganza. Think dinner jackets and crystal candelabra, with far fewer pyrotechnics and bearded queens.\n\nSome 68 years later it has morphed from something resembling an Ian Fleming novel into a camp gala of pop culture. Hosted by the previous winning entry's home nation, each year it puts the spotlight on their millions of prospective tourists.\n\nThis year it's all to sing for.\n\nGood question. Neither are geographically in Europe.\n\nDespite Australia being on the opposite side of the globe from the Continent, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) extended an invitation to Canberra and broadcaster SBS 10 years ago.\n\nAustralia officially entered the competition in 2014, although Eurovision had been broadcast Downunder since 1981.\n\nThis year Electric Fields will represent Australia at the Eurovision contest. While under normal rules the winning entry's country has to host the competition the following year, an Aussie victory would require them to nominate another country in the bloc to host it for them.\n\nIsrael was the first non-European country to participate, first taking part in 1973 because the Israeli national broadcaster was already an EBU member. Having hosted the competition in Jerusalem three times off the back of three victories, Israel last won the competition in 2018 with performer Netta.\n\nThere are still no offers for New Zealand to compete.\n\nAfter Loreen of Sweden won the 2023 event - as only the second person ever to win the title more than once - this year's hosts and Ireland are now level-pegging with seven titles each.\n\nAlthough Ireland has a long history of success, it hasn't had a winning entry since 1997.\n\nAbba might be the host nation's most famous export and Waterloo the first Eurovision song that comes to mind.\n\nCanadian singer Celene Dion won in 1988 as honorary entry for Switzerland, singing Ne partez pas sans moi.\n\nHowever, the most famous song to debut at Eurovision is arguably Domenico Mudugno's Nel Blu Di Pinto Di Blu, which you'll otherwise known as Volare. From Pavarotti to David Bowie and Dean Martin, it's an Italian crooner for the ages.\n\nUnlike other international competitions, there are no cash prizes or rewards. First place earns exactly the same reward as 37th place - each country's entry is in it \"pour l'honneur seulement\".\n\nIn fact, if you win your home nation be expected to pay to host the competition.\n\nA long-held joke is that the real winners of the ESC are the runners-up. It's a view that backfired spectacularly on second-placed UK in 2022, who were forced to pay an estimated $50 million to host the competition in Liverpool after winners Ukraine could not host the competition.\n\nDespite having one of the most active voting blocs outside the competing country, New Zealand has never been part of the competition.\n\nLast year, EU Ambassador to New Zealand Nina Obermaier hinted that Kiwi artists could one day join the competitors.\n\n\"If you build on the music that has come out of New Zealand in recent time and over the last couple of decades, there's certainly a strong chance,\" she told RNZ.But who would we enter?\n\nLorde - the Solar Power singer might have the biggest name recognition but an entry by her could backfire. Despite bangers galore, her biggest handicap is her republican streak and disapproval of Royals. \"That kind luxe\" might not be for us, but Europeans love that stuff. 3 / 10\n\nStan Walker - edgy, unapologetically M\u0101ori and with a fashion sense that would put Stockholm to shame, Stan could be the man. And shark tooth earrings on Eurovision would be a proud moment for Aotearoa TV. 9 / 10\n\nThe Topp Twins - not an obvious choice, but Eurovision has a long history of novelty acts. Plus, sending the yodelling twins back to ze Vaterland would be a win for all. 10 / 10\n\nThe song competition finals are set for Sat, 11 May 2024 Malmo time, so the party is set to kick off on Sunday Morning here. Here's what to look out for.\n\nAs sure as spring follows winter, and the public vote follows jurors scores, there are some Eurovision cliches that are sure to turn up.", "source": {"uri":

Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain, known collectively as the Big Five, already know the order of performance in the final to be held at the Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\nThis year, the order of performance was determined through a novel drawing system that took place in a public session on Reddit. During this event, each Big Five country drew a ballot that would decide their fate on the big night of May 11. While some countries were awarded a fixed position, others, such as Spain and Italy, left their fate in the hands of the Eurovision producers.\n\nThe decision to incorporate a producer's choice option into this year's draw, approved by the European Broadcasting Union Reference Group, adds a bit more intrigue.\n\nUnder this system, producers have the power to decide the order of action of the countries that obtained blank ballots. Thus, Nebulossa, like the Italian candidacy, will have to wait to find out when it takes the stage in Malm\u00f6. The final decision on Spain's performance will be announced in the second semi-final, on the night of May 9-10.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the members of the Big Five have already been assigned their positions.

In 2022, the EBU expelled Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement on the Eurovision website, the EBU said: \"The Russian public service broadcasters had their EBU membership suspended in 2022 due to consistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service media values.\"\n\nThere have also been calls for artists due to perform to boycott the contest and withdraw in solidarity with Palestinian people.\n\nLast month, 400 Irish artists wrote a letter addressed to Bambie Thug, calling on them to boycott the contest. Tonight, Ireland's non-binary entrant said people looking for them to boycott should \"be contacting the EBU and RT\u00c9 more than me\".\n\n\"We are easy targets as artists. I don't think it's entirely fair to bully us so much, especially because I am doing everything in my power which I can do, outside of this.\n\n\"There is obviously pressure, but at the same time I am one person, I cannot make the change that [people] think I can,\" they said.\n\n\"I am trying just to remain in my bubble now because there is one thing I need to do...and we are moving up in the odds and it has been a long road for me and also I am standing for a lot of things as a queer person as well and I am doing this for a lot of voices.\"\n\nBambie Thug is confident about their performance of their song 'Doomsday Blue' at the first semi-final on Tuesday night.\n\n\"Nothing affects my performance. I am a performer, I am here to show my art on the stage regardless of what is happening. In those three minutes; that's what's happening in those three minutes... Obviously there is a massive cloud over it, but I am here to do one thing I have been working my whole life for, so I am going to be working very hard and giving the performance of a lifetime.\"\n\nThey added that they are proud \"of what we have created\".\n\nIn response to calls to expel Israel, the EBU Director General, and former Director General of RT\u00c9, Noel Curran, said the Eurovision \"is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments\".\n\nThe Israeli delegation did not attend the turquoise carpet tonight because of Holocaust Memorial Day in their country.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 visitors are due to arrive in Malmo for the world's largest live music contest.\n\nThere is heightened security around the event and according to local reports, forces have been drafted in from across Sweden, along with reinforcements from Denmark and Norway.\n\nEarlier this week Bambie Thug was hospitalised after eating \"bad shellfish\" just days before their performance in the semi-final stage.\n\nThe Cork artist was forced to cancel a planned meet-and-greet performance in Malmo on Friday night and was taken to hospital and placed on a drip after becoming unwell.\n\nThey said they were feeling considerably better after resting.\n\n\"How's my health? I am better today... I am over the food poisoning... it was horrible.. and gross. An ordeal but I am alright,\" they said.\n\nThey added that they are feeling confident in their performance and were joined on the red carpet with their choreographer Matt Williams.\n\nMany of the acts spoke about the unifying impact of music when they walked the carpet.\n\nThe favourite to win the competition is the Croatian act Baby Lasagna with their song 'Rim Tim Tagi Dim'. There is also a lot of support for non-binary Swiss artist Nemo's 'The Code'.\n\nThe Finnish act Windows95man will sing 'No Rules!' And broke out into song on the carpet, while the Dutch act Joost spoke of the personal meaning behind their single 'Europapa' which he has dedicated to his deceased parents.\n\nThe last time the Eurovision was staged in Malmo was in 1992 and Ireland were victorious - winning with Linda Martin's 'Why Me?'.\n\nIreland has not qualified for the Grand Final since 2018 with Ryan O'Shaughnessy and his track, 'Together'.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Me?_(Linda_Martin_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Why Me?

Wearing a black hoodie, jeanes and backwards baseball cap, he is seen walking in between two officers at the event.\n\nHe later stops and is spotted talking to one of the cops as he gestures wildly before filming himself walking again with the cop at his side. Sharing the clip on Instagram, he appeared to refer to himself waving an Israeli flag earlier as others waved Palestinian flags and suggested that he received unfair treatment.\n\nHochman wrote in Hebrew: \"Europe 2024. A Jew with one flag and one egg is escorted out so that the supporters of Palestine who are waving a flag in violation of Eurovision rules, stop cursing and spitting. Not giving up, they won't take my head off.\" He then concerningly added in an odd ramble: \"May their name be erased. One day Rosengard, this Islamic neighborhood in Malm\u00f6, will explode in their faces... And they will cry, oh how they will cry for having surrendered to evil... That they collaborated with him. And the message we should take from it... Let them hate us no matter our opinions... And we must stand together. With one.\"\n\nIt has not been confirmed whether he was escorted away from the Eurovision Village for simply waving the Israeli flag or if there was an additional reason. The Mirror has reached out to Eurovision for comment.\n\nHochman was escorted away from the venue He posted about the incident on Instagram\n\nThis year's Eurovision has already been swamped in controversy following the decision to allow Israel to participate amid Israel's military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, which is now in its seventh month. The war in Gaza has driven around 80% of the territory's population of 2.3million from their homes and caused vast destruction to apartments, hospitals, mosques and schools across several cities. The death toll in Gaza has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has also this week been accused of being \"morally corrupt\" and \"hypocritical\" after expressing their \"regret\" in a statement regarding Eric Saade's performance on Tuesday night. Bosses accused the former Swedish Eurovision contestant of comprising the alleged \"non-political nature\" of the event after Saade took to the stage in Sweden to open the competition's semi-final, with the singer displaying a keffiyeh print scarf wrapped around his left wrist as he performed his 2011 entry Popular.\n\nAhead of the event at Malmo Arena, those attending were warned not to bring Palestinian flags, symbols or bags and were told that there will be \"vigorous security checks\". Palestine are not competing in this year's competition but Israel - located in the Middle East - are.\n\nIt comes after Eurovision banned Russia from taking part in 2022 after their invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Israel raised its travel warnings for the duration of the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden this year due to planned protests. The Israeli National Security Agency said it plans to raise the threat level from two to three amid heightened tensions over the war in Gaza. Widespread protests are expected to cast a shadow over the event.\n\nThe NISA advisory said: \"Malmo is recognized as a hub for anti-Israel protests, given its high concentration of immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran. These protests are a weekly occurrence and often involve demonstrations, calls for harm against Jews and Israelis, and the burning of Israeli flags, among other actions. Notably, on October 7 (the day of Hamas' attack on Israel), anti-Israeli elements in Malmo openly celebrated the tragic events that occurred in Israel.\n\n\"Furthermore, alongside the protests in Malmo, there has been a recent surge in calls from global jihadist groups and radical Islamists to carry out attacks against Western targets. This includes specific threats against Israelis and Jews worldwide, with a particular focus on events garnering significant media attention. In light of this, it's worth mentioning that just recently (on March 19), two ISIS activists were apprehended for plotting an attack on the Swedish parliament.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok ,

It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"Our governing bodies ... did review the participants list for the 2024 contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster Kan met all the competition rules for this year and can participate, as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThose who oppose the involvement of Israel have highlighted Russia's expulsion following the illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAddressing this issue, Mr Curran said: \"In the case of Russia, the Russian broadcasters themselves were suspended from the EBU due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values.\n\n\"The relationship between Kan and the Israeli government is fundamentally different to the relationship that exists between those Russian members and the state, with the Israeli government in recent years threatening to close down the broadcaster.\"\n\nThe nation withdrew due to changes in broadcasting priorities and financial concerns.\n\nHowever, it will be returning in 2024 with Tali Golergant and her song Fighter.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jimmy_grant@thesun.co.uk",

PA WIRE / EBU PA WIRE / EBU / EBU\n\nMODERN DAY MARKETING for the Eurovision pitches the contest as a uniting force for people across Europe and beyond - more of a movement than a mere entertainment event, and one that's above the fray of petty regional politics.\n\nIn the face of controversy over Israel's participation in Malm\u00f6 this year the European Broadcasting Union, which stages the contest, has repeatedly stressed that the three-night extravaganza is a non-political musical event for public broadcasters and not a competition between governments. Inclusivity, equality, \"and celebrating diversity through music\" are central to its values, according to Song Contest supremo Martin \u00d6sterdahl.\n\nCalls for participating acts and Eurovision fans to boycott in protest at Israel's involvement have only intensified in recent weeks as the death toll in Gaza has climbed to almost 35,000 people. The boycott campaign started late last year following the start of Israel's bombardment of Gaza in the wake of the 7 October Hamas attacks.\n\nSo how did we get here? And what can we expect in Malm\u00f6 in the coming days as fans arrive and the semi-final shows begin?\n\nYears of controversy\n\nAs non-political events go, Eurovision has had to contend with an array of minor and major political controversies in the past decade or so - its recent history mirroring the various tensions and conflicts in the continent and wider region.\n\nBack in 2016 Ukraine's victory with 1944 - a politically-charged ballad about Crimea - was said to have heightened tensions with Russia. The contest was held in Kyiv the following year - but Russia was forced to withdraw after it emerged that its singer had once toured the annexed peninsula.\n\nIsrael's win in 2018 led to widespread calls for a boycott of the following year's event, which was held amid high security in Tel Aviv (the government had pushed to host in Jerusalem, but eventually had to settle for the alternate venue). On the night, Icelandic entrants Hatari and interval act Madonna got into hot water for acts of protest that involved displaying the Palestinian flag.\n\nThe Journal / YouTube\n\nThe Covid pandemic put paid to the 2020 contest, and while 2021 may be best remembered - among Eurovision fans at least - for the emergence of Italian rockers M\u00e5neskin, there was controversy that year too after Belarus was disqualified for fielding lyrics deemed to be too political.\n\nThe most notable decision the EBU has had to make in recent years came in the wake of the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The broadcasting union initially stated that Russia could remain in the lineup, but made an about turn within 24 hours in the face of protests from other members - including threats to withdraw. A surge of viewer votes meant Ukraine won the contest by a mile that May and Russia hasn't returned since.\n\nIn spite of the tumult of the previous few years, the EBU was again insisting it couldn't be drawn into politics during last year's contest after rejecting Volodymyr Zelenskyy's request to address the Grand Final. \"Political or similar statements\" could not be made as part of the contest, the EBU said.\n\nThe event was being held in Liverpool as the UK hosted on behalf of Ukraine. The EBU's decision to turn Zelenskyy down managed to unite Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer in their condemnation. Boris Johnson joined in for good measure.\n\nWhat's happened this year?\n\nPolitics has loomed large throughout the buildup to this year's contest. In Ireland, at least, coverage has been dominated by the debate over Israel. RT\u00c9 - which, as the national broadcaster, oversees the country's entry - had already received hundreds of emails calling on it to boycott by mid-December, more than a month before the selection of this year's act.\n\nAsked by The Journal for their response to calls for a boycott on the eve of the national final, two of the acts - including winner Bambie Thug and pre-event favourite Erica-Cody - said they didn't think Israel should be taking part. Leo Varadkar weighed into the debate saying he wouldn't back a boycott campaign. Some opposition TDs disagreed.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, artists in Finland and Iceland were among those calling for Israel to be excluded. In Sweden, Robyn and First Aid Kit were among more than 1,000 acts adding their voices to a call for an Israeli ban. Many of those calling for Israel to be excluded cited the approach taken to Russia in 2022. In the UK, while there were also calls for a boycott from various groups, well-known figures like Helen Mirren and Boy George added their names to a letter rejecting the boycott calls and supporting Israel's inclusion.\n\nIn Israel itself, meanwhile, the 7 October attacks were strongly referenced during the run of the weekly 'Hakochav Haba' (Rising Star) show used to select the country's contestant. The eventual winner - 20-year-old Eden Golan - clinched her place in Malm\u00f6 in February by performing a cover version of Aerosmith's 'Don't Want to Miss a Thing' surrounded by empty chairs as a tribute to the hostages taken by Hamas.\n\nWithin the space of a few weeks, however, Golan's participation in Malm\u00f6 was thrown into doubt after it emerged EBU officials weren't happy with apparent references to the Hamas attacks in her song's lyrics. A standoff ensued, as the Israeli broadcaster Kan said it wouldn't be changing them.\n\nAs both sides dug in, the Israeli head of state made an unprecedented intervention in the row. The contest was too important for Israel not to be represented, President Isaac Herzog insisted. The lyrics must be changed.\n\nKan said the President had emphasised \"that it is precisely at a time when those who hate us are seeking to repress and boycott the State of Israel\" that the country \"must raise its voice\" in international forums.\n\nAdvertisement Why the intervention?\n\nHistorically, Israel's participation in the Eurovision has been a major cultural uniting factor within the country. Although Middle Eastern and North African countries who are part of the European Broadcasting Area have always been entitled to take part, Israel were, essentially, the first ones to think of it.\n\nOther states in the region have had brief flirtations with the competition over the decades, but on the most part they've sat it out - largely due to Israel's presence. Israel has won the contest an impressive four times - three short of the record now jointly held by Ireland and Sweden. And while it's difficult to quantify the depth of interest in the contest within the country in any given year, widespread coverage across Israeli media means its Eurovision act is always a household name. (To underscore that point, look no further than this unconventional piece of advice from former premier Naftali Bennett, who suggested that Israelis could flush out Hamas militants who were posing as IDF members by asking for the name of the current Eurovision singer. He was certain \"the terrorists will not know\").\n\nWhile Herzog, as president, occupies a largely ceremonial role, his intervention settled the matter for Kan and Israel. His rationale for insisting on participation is clear - unlike Russia in 2022, Israel hasn't been excluded from other international cultural and sporting groups and associations. There was a risk that exclusion from the Eurovision could play into the hands of those wishing to cast Israel in the role of pariah state.\n\nThe Late Late Show / YouTube Why hasn't the EBU acted?\n\nOn the pro-boycott side of the debate accusations that the Netanyahu government was using art as a propaganda tool intensified. In the wake of further calls for a boycott, Bambie Thug and a host of other Eurovision acts, including the UK's Olly Alexander, released a statement confirming that they would take part, but calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nA few weeks later Bambie Thug declared on the Late Late Show that they stood with those choosing to boycott, reiterating that they had decided to stay in the competition to ensure pro-Palestinian views were represented. Yet another pro-boycott letter followed, this time with Eurosong finalist Erica-Cody among the hundreds of signatories.\n\nWhile there was criticism of a perceived hypocrisy in Bambie Thug's stance, a number of pro-Gaza voices from the Irish music scene defended their position. 1994 Eurovision winner Charlie McGettigan said the Cork singer was now in the perfect position at the contest \"to voice Ireland's disapproval of what's going on\" in Gaza. On Prime Time, Steve Wall of The Stunning argued that \"it shouldn't be put on poor Bambie Thug's shoulders\" and that it was up to the EBU to act, as it had in 2022.\n\nChris West, author of an authoritative book about the history of modern Europe told through the Eurovision, argues that - at this juncture - there is no straight analogy between what happened in 2022 and in 2024, at least from the EBU's point of view.\n\n\"In 2022 two countries actually said they were going to pull out - at which point the EBU pulled Russia out,\" West said in a phone interview with The Journal.\n\n\"At the moment nobody has threatened to pull out and I'm not even sure anyone has formally approached the EBU.\"\n\nThe broadcasting union was pushed into taking action against Russia - \"perhaps very willingly\" - by its members, West stressed.\n\n\"Until the EBU - which is an organisation made up of public service broadcasters - until people start putting pressure on it, it's not going to do anything. And in a way if members can't be bothered to make a stand, why should they?\"\n\nA banner with the text \"Boycott Israel. Eurovision Song Contest Malm\u00f6 2024\" in the annual 1 May demonstration in Malm\u00f6. TT News Agency / Alamy Stock Photo TT News Agency / Alamy Stock Photo / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nWhat to expect in Malm\u00f6\n\nAuthorities have promised a \"visible\" security presence during the week of the contest, including police with submachine guns. Reinforcements from Denmark and Norway are being drafted in. As of last week, at least half a dozen applications had been submitted for various protests, including one to burn the Koran - an act which is not currently illegal in Sweden.\n\nThe main pro-Gaza protests are set to take place on Thursday, when Israel compete in the second semi-final, and on the day of the Grand Final on Saturday.\n\n\"We don't think a state that is carrying out genocide in Gaza should be taking part - we want Israel stopped from taking part in Eurovision,\" Yomn Kadoura, a Palestinian woman living in Malm\u00f6 and one of the organisers of the protests told The Journal.\n\nShe said she was expecting thousands to turn out for the protests in the city, which has a sizeable Palestinian population. \"They will be peaceful protests.\"\n\nEurovision fans from Israel are being advised to exercise caution when out and about in the city. Security officials have warned Malm\u00f6 will be \"an unfriendly area for Israelis\" and members of the Jewish community within the city have spoken of their fears ahead of the contest.\n\nSo far the only visible indication of Eurovision-related unrest has been the vandalism of a large digital sign back in March.\n\nAll in all, however, and particularly for an event that prides itself on inclusivity, it makes for a very different atmosphere compared to recent contests.\n\nA large number of Irish fans are still expected to travel - amongst them Cork teacher and lifelong Eurovision fan Sinead Halpin. Halpin was in Liverpool last year - her first outing to watch the contest in person - and managed to snap up tickets to the final this time around.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm wary,\" she said of the security concerns. While she expects to be safe during her visit \"when we're travelling we're making sure we're very, very careful\".\n\nRead Next Related Reads Johnny Logan to return to Eurovision stage as interval act Eurovision: 'Die in' staged at RT\u00c9 as singers and campaigners call for boycott of contest 'Same energy as Russia': Two of Ireland's Eurovision hopefuls say Israel should be cut from contest\n\nHalpin, who is also a candidate for the Social Democrats in the upcoming local elections, has been campaigning for the Irish delegation to be allowed to speak freely on the matter of Gaza while in Malm\u00f6. That campaign has included writing to arts and media minister Catherine Martin and to RT\u00c9 director general Kevin Bakhurst. On the basis that the contest is one between broadcasters not nations, she's raised specific criticisms about Kan and its coverage of the bombardment of Gaza.\n\nThere has been talk within Eurovision fan Whatsapp groups of organising a \"targeted boycott\" of Israel's appearance next week, Halpin said. In the arena, that could take the form of the crowd refusing to wave their LED wristbands in the air as the cameras pan the arena, or even leaving their seats.\n\n\"I did actually completely boycott the 2019 contest. There's a gap in my knowledge about Eurovision because I know absolutely nothing about 2019.\"\n\nWhile she's planning to attend the final, Halpin says it's important that Song Contest fans \"don't have blinkers on and are aware of the politicisation of us by the Israeli broadcaster and Israel\".\n\nReferencing the diplomatic row that developed around the Ireland v Israel basketball qualifier back in February, Halpin added: \"Nobody was saying to the basketball team, you personally should not play - they were saying to the organisers it's not fair to force them to play.\"\n\nBambie Thug shouldn't be singled out by campaigners backing a boycott, she said.\n\n\"This is a failure of the EBU and a failure of the various broadcasters to protect their acts, to make it so that their acts can freely talk.\"\n\nOGAE Ireland - the Irish Eurovision fan club - released its own statement during the week expressing its disappointment at the \"politicisation and propagandisation\" of the contest carried out by the Israeli broadcaster and the country's delegation.\n\nFinal preparations at Malm\u00f6 Arena. Johan Nilsson / TT News Agency via AP, File Johan Nilsson / TT News Agency via AP, File / TT News Agency via AP, File\n\nWhere are we now?\n\nThe highest profile protest yet calling for Ireland to withdraw was staged at RT\u00c9's Dublin 4 campus just last Thursday. The demonstration included a 'die in' staged by campaigners from the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign.\n\n\"Ireland has been associated with the Eurovision forever ... people know what it means to us,\" singer Mary Coughlan said, calling on RT\u00c9 to \"do the right thing\".\n\nOver in Malm\u00f6, meanwhile, the contest has its official opening tonight as the Eurovision acts take to the Turquoise Carpet to meet the media. Malm\u00f6 Arena will be packed out tomorrow night as the first live show - which serves as a dress rehearsal for Tuesday's first semi-final - gets under way.\n\nNone of the 37 singers and groups slated to take part has hinted at pulling out - but that's not to say there won't be some attempts at acts of protest within the arena, either on the part of the participants or by audience members.\n\nIn Ireland, meanwhile, most people - to the extent that they think about it at all - will only now be starting to consider whether to tune in or not.\n\nNo opinion polls have been carried out to determine the depth of support or opposition to calls for a boycott.\n\nHowever, a report on the proceedings at a Cork City Council meeting last month may go some way towards indicating the state of public sentiment on the issue.\n\nA motion was proposed calling for the EBU to ban Israel. Amid the debate, a Green Party councillor's effort to bring an amendment backing Bambie Thug's stance was criticised as contradictory and voted down.\n\nThe original motion went through with 12 votes in favour, nine against and one abstention.\n\nThe Journal's Daragh Brophy will be in Malm\u00f6 covering the contest and surrounding events - you can follow him here on Twitter/X\n\nMaking a difference A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.

It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"Our governing bodies ... did review the participants list for the 2024 contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster Kan met all the competition rules for this year and can participate, as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThose who oppose the involvement of Israel have highlighted Russia's expulsion following the illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAddressing this issue, Mr Curran said: \"In the case of Russia, the Russian broadcasters themselves were suspended from the EBU due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values.\n\n\"The relationship between Kan and the Israeli government is fundamentally different to the relationship that exists between those Russian members and the state, with the Israeli government in recent years threatening to close down the broadcaster.\"\n\nThe five-time winner Luxembourg is returning to the competition for the first time since 1993.\n\nThe nation withdrew due to changes in broadcasting priorities and financial concerns.\n\nHowever, it will be returning in 2024 with Tali Golergant and her song Fighter.", "source": {"uri":

Here's the ultimate guide to who's who\n\nSinging cyber-witches, Switzerland's answer to Freddie Mercury and Olly Alexander crooning from inside a Rubik's Cube-shaped spaceship. Either the new season of Doctor Who is a lot wilder than anyone expected or it's the Eurovision Song Contest (it's the Eurovision Song Contest).\n\nAhead of the first semi-final on May 7, broadcast at 8pm on BBC One, we count down the 37 entries - which, as ever, run from sublime to ridiculous and all the way back again.\n\nThe FrontrunnersCroatia\n\nBaby Lasagna - Rim Tim Tagi Dim\n\nBookies favourite Marko Puri\u0161i\u0107 - you'll be shocked to learn Baby Lasagna is a stage name - brings the fun to Eurovision with a rock-techno crossover in which the narrator gives up a life of milking cows on the farm and sets their heart on rock'n'roll success. It's fun but low-key political, too - Puri\u0161i\u0107 explains that the lyrics are about the mass youth emigration from Croatia and the consequent brain drain.\n\nSwitzerland Nemo - The Code\n\nSecond favourite according to the bookmakers and a song that stands immediately out from the pack. Nemo - a non-binary, rapper, singer and violinist - combines Freddie Mercury-style operatics, gothic piano and decent lyrics by Eurovision standards (\"I went to hell and back to get myself on track\"). It's great and could be a winner.\n\nNetherlands Joost Klein - Europapa\n\nWho's the daddy? Not Europapa singer Klein whose \"happy hardcore\" banger isn't all that bothered about setting dance-floors ablaze. The lyrics are actually about the death of his parents while he was a child and the lifelong shadow cast by grief.\n\nItalyAngelina Mango - La noia\n\nSinging in Italian, singer-songwriter Mango delivers a decent impersonation of Shakira doing battle with an aggressive acoustic guitar. It's great fun with a zinging sense of irreverence - but does it have that Eurovision oomph? Yes, say the bookmakers who have marked it out as a frontrunner.\n\nUkraineAlyona Alyona and Jerry Heil - Teresa & Maria\n\nGiven what's happening in Ukraine, it's no surprise the country has not arrived at Malm\u00f6 with a party tune. Instead, it's an intense ballad addressed to Mother Theresa and the Virgin Mary, full of the pain you can only know if you've experienced war firsthand.\n\nThe RestAlbania Besa - Titan\n\nAlbania hits Eurovision at full pelt with a big, buoyant euro-bopper. Besa is the daughter of a prominent millionaire and spent some of her childhood in London. Not that this has any bearing on Titan, an Ariana Grande-style power ballad that mooches along before kicking off properly in its final minute.\n\nArmeniaLadaniva - Jako\n\nThe Caucuses meet Latin America in this explosive mash-up of influences from a French-Arminian duo who started out on the Paris jazz scene. The title references singer Jaklin Baghdasaryan's nickname and celebrates artistic freedom and self-confidence. \"Growing up I have always been told that girls should behave, be humble, dress normally, not talk too much, not do crazy things,\" she said.\n\nAustria Kaleen - We Will Rave\n\nHuge house beats and wispy vocals collide on an energetic song - but is it too generically Eurovision? And why does it sound a bit like Lady Gaga's Bad Romance meets Fat of the Land-era Prodigy?\n\nAustralia Electric Fields - One Milkali\n\nDance duo One Milkali created history by incorporating Yankunytjatjara, one of the languages of Australia's First Peoples, into their entry. It's a shame they didn't bring the same spirit of innovation to a listless dancefloor workout.\n\nAzerbaijan Fahree - \u00d6z\u00fcnl\u0259 Apar\n\nSinger Ilkin Dovlatov uses traditional Azeri lyrics for the chorus but otherwise, this sounds like a 10-year-old Justin Timberlake b-side. There is a lot of howling - one of those recent Eurovision trends that seems set to stick around for a while longer.\n\nBelgium Mustii - Before The Party's Over\n\nHercules and Love Affair meets Harry Styles and Troye Sivan on a bittersweet party anthem that asks, \"Are we sure the kids are alright or just playing it cool?\". The boring answer is that the kids probably spend too long on TikTok, but that doesn't bother Mustii, who dashes towards a crashing chorus.\n\nCyprusSilia Kapsis - Liar\n\nEurovision wouldn't be Eurovision without a cut-and-paste Britney Spears homage with wonky lyrics, and that's what Silia Kapsis delivers with the Liar (\"I'm feeling like ooh-la-la\"). It's got energy, however - and a compelling performance in the semi-finals could get it over the line.\n\nCzechiaAiko - Pedestal\n\nA few years ago at Eurovision, you couldn't swing a tiny flag without hitting another Billie Eilish clone. Now, every second artist reminds you of Olivia Rodrigo's Good 4 U. A case in point is Czech's Aiko, whose song Pedestal was co-written by Steve Ansell of landfill indie stalwarts Blood Red Shoes.\n\nDenmark Saba - Sand\n\nYou can't go wrong with a house piano intro - yet Saba (a sometime actress and the first black queer woman to represent Denmark) almost manages to ruin the fun with this dull Dua Lipa-style dance workout.\n\nEstonia 5MIINUST x Puuluup - (Nendest) narkootikumidest ei tea me (k\u00fcll) midagi\n\nWhy send one entrant when you can submit two? That's Estonia's big idea for this mash-up between hip-hop crew 5MIINUST and lyre-playing techno group Puuluup. The lyrics are about a narcotics bust and translate as: \"We don't really know anything about these drugs\". We don't really know anything about them making the final, either.\n\nFinland Windows95Man - No Rules!\n\nHow wacky do you like your Eurovision? If the answer is lots, you'll appreciate this \"zany\" Euro-pop belter that sounds like Right Said Fred meets Faithless. The live performance features exploding trousers - which is just as well because, without the pyrotechnics, the song is pure pants. Window95Man isn't the singer's real name, you'll be stunned to hear. By day, Teemu Keisteri is a visual artist known for his witty, subversive imagery. They've only packed the Finnish Banksy off to Eurovision.\n\nFranceSlimane - Mon Amour\n\nA French Eurovision entry called Mon Amour could only ever be one thing: a tepid piano ballad with a string section so rich you can feel your cholesterol shoot up while listening. Slimane won series five of The Voice France and has released four chart-topping LPs.\n\nGeorgiaNutsa Buzaladze - Firefighter\n\nNo stranger to a big occasion, Buzaladze performed on American Idol 2023, where she duetted with Kylie Minogue. After that, Eurovision is almost a comedown - and she should be so lucky to reach the final with a catchy yet unremarkable chunk of mid-tempo pop.\n\nGermanyIsaak - Always On The Run\n\nHaving flopped badly at recent Eurovisions, Germany has come up with the clever solution of sending a song that sounds like Eye of the Tiger by Survivor. Risin' up, back on the street they may be, but can Germany improve on 2023's humiliating last-place finish? Isaak seems up for the challenge. Then again, when your career highlights include belting out Wonderwall on X Factor Germany, as he did in 2011, the only way is up.\n\nGreeceMarina Satti - Zari\n\nIt's all happening on Satti's perky blend of reggaeton, Euro-grooves, and - well, we've all been waiting for one - a solo on an ancient Persian pipe called the Zurna.\n\nIceland Hera Bj\u00f6rk - Scared Of Heights\n\nNo relation to the former Sugarcubes singer, the Icelandic entry delivers a traditional hair-dryer belter that hits like Bonnie Tyler for Generation TikTok. It's not necessarily a bad idea, but Hera never convinces you that it's a good one either. It's her second Eurovision, following on from a 19th place finish in Oslo in 2010.\n\nIreland Bambie Thug - Doomsday Blue\n\nIt's already been a big year for Cork, with Cillian Murphy winning the Oscar for Best Actor. Can Bambie Thug, from the market town of Macroom, equal that success with their \"Ouija pop\" epic Doomsday Blue? Shrieking hellishly and cavorting with demonic forces is a bit of a departure for Eurovision - but not for Ireland, which has sent Jedward on two separate occasions.\n\nIsrael Eden Golan - Hurricane\n\nRegardless of the quality of Golan's performance in Thursday's second semi-final, it will be overshadowed by controversy over Israel's participation in the contest. She's already been forced to change the name of her lush power ballad after its original title, October Rain, was interpreted as referencing the Hamas attack on October 7, thus breaching the EBU's no politics rule.\n\nLatviaDons - Hollow\n\nThe influence of Olly Murs has reached the Baltics via a generic man-ballad from a former DJ and reality TV star who, when living in London, went by the stage-name \"Art Singer\".\n\nLithuania Silvester Belt - Luktelk\n\nOne of those by-the-numbers Eurovision tunes that seems to erase itself from your memory even as you listen. It has a middle-of-the-road tempo and trite lyrics about putting on a sunny face to the outside world. Belt is a graduate of the University of Westminster and placed sixth in X Factor Lithuania. He'll do well to match that performance in Sweden.\n\nLuxembourgTali Golergant - Fighter\n\nLuxembourg is staging a spectacular Eurovision comeback as the five-time winner returns for the first time in 31 years. It's a plucky comeback, featuring expressive French-language vocals, a twitchy guitar hook and a nice \"hahah-oh-haah\" chorus.\n\nMalta Sarah Bonnici - Loop\n\nOne of the smaller Eurovision nations, Malta has always acquitted itself respectably (though it hasn't reached the final since 2016). Alas, it's at the back of the back with this listless Euro-thumper, which sounds like something you might have encountered on a sun holiday but which evaporated along with your hangover. Bonnici is the daughter of a prominent Maltese businessman and was previously a dancer at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMoldovaNatalia Barbu - In the Middle\n\nBarbu scores a full house of Eurovision bingo - an Arabic-style chorus, swooning strings and hollow lyrics (\"raise your wings... don't be afraid\"). It's a second Eurovision for the artist, who also represented Moldova in 2007.\n\nNorway G\u00e5te - Ulveham\n\nPagan popsters Heilung are an audible influence on \"progressive folk\" outfit G\u00e5te, whose song tells the tale of a young woman banished to the woods where she goes wild. Despite the gory subject, the tune is surprisingly mannered - and will do well to reach the final.\n\nPoland Luna - The Tower\n\nWith its \"Alone, alone, alone...\" chorus and wonky beats, Luna does her best Dua Lipa impersonation. Whether that's enough to woo voters remains to be seen. Naming Bj\u00f6rk as an influence, she promises her performance will be a \"fairy tale\".\n\nPortugal Iolanda - Grito\n\nA graduate of the songwriting program at BIMM Sussex, Iolanda Costa is a former contestant on The Voice Portugal. \"Grito\" translates to shout, but it's a tender ballad that rarely raises its voice, which may be a problem when it comes to wooing voters.\n\nSan Marino Megara - 11:11\n\nThe Italian-speaking micro-state will never better the year it sent rapper Flo Rida. This year, rock band Megara - actually from Madrid - stakes their hopes on a 90s-esque pop banger that sounds like a distant cousin of the Spice Girls' Spice Up Your Life with bonus guitars. It's Megara's third rodeo, following two unsuccessful bids to represent Spain in the contest.\n\nSerbiaTeya Dora - Ramonda\n\nA song that wears its politics on its sleeve - but that's okay because the context is historical rather than contemporary. The title refers to the Ramonda flower Serbians wear in remembrance of those who died in the First World War. It's a big, blustering ballad delivered to perfection by Dora, who had a big TikTok hit last year with D\u017eanum.\n\nSloveniaRaiven - Veronika\n\nThe spirit of Florence and the Machine stalks Raiven's pile-driver weepie - though the song surprises in the final 30 seconds by turning into a heavy metal Taylor Swift. It won't win, but her shrieking fade-out certainly sets it apart from the pack. It isn't the 28 year-old's first Eurovision experience: she placed second in Slovenia's national contests in 2016 and 2019.\n\nSpain Nebulossa - Zorra\n\nThere's been controversy in Spain over \"Zorra\", which can be translated as either \"vixen\" or \"bitch\", and is regarded by some as a sexist slur. His'n'Hers duo Nebulossa say they are reclaiming the word and have chosen to storm the barricades via a perky electro bopper that sounds like the Pet Shop Boys's lost Balearic album.\n\nSwedenMarcus & Martinus - Unforgettable\n\nSweden is going for a record-breaking eighth win. However, identical twins Marcus & Martinus - actually from Norway - play it safe with a squelchy electro ditty that lands like a Troye Sivan b-side. Pre-Eurovision their claim to notoriety was winning Sweden's version of Masked Singer.\n\nUK Olly Alexander - Dizzy\n\nPoor Olly Alexander. Until last year, he'd been outstanding in everything he had done, whether fronting early Years & Years or delivering a searing lead performance in Russell T Davies's AIDs-era drama It's A Sin.\n\nSadly, Dizzy - a soggy mash-up of Pet Shop Boys and Gloria Gaynor - just can't get off the ground, though his inventive sci-fi staging may help Alexander belatedly achieve lift-off at Saturday's grand final.\n\nThe first Eurovision semi-final is broadcast May 7, 8pm, BBC One; the final is on May 11, 8pm", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Our top 10 favourites", "body": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 is underway, with delegates from countries including the UK, France, Sweden, Germany, Croatia, Ireland and Switzerland competing to take home the trophy at the grand final on Saturday 11 May.\n\nEurovision is typically known for its uplifting atmosphere, as fans celebrate each country's musical talents along with plenty of dramatic staging, zany costumes and tremendous vocal performances.\n\nThis year's event, however, is the subject of considerable controversy due to organisers the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) refusing to ban Israel from participating, amid calls for a boycott over its ongoing war on Gaza.\n\nProtests are expected to take place outside the Malm\u00f6 Arena in Sweden, which is hosting this year's contest after its delegate Loreen was crowned the winner with her song \"Tattoo\".\n\nOn Tuesday 7 May, the first semi-final took place, and saw favourites Bambie Thug (Ireland) and Baby Lasagna (Croatia) sail through to the final, along with Finland's Window95Man and delegates from Luxembourg, Serbia, Ukraine, Portugal, Lithuania and Cyprus.\n\nThe UK is guaranteed a spot in the final thanks to its status as one of the \"big five\" countries who make the largest contribution to the event, along with France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Sweden is also guaranteed a spot after winning last year's contest.\n\nThe next semi-final is scheduled for Thursday 9 May. As the competition heats up, here are our top 10 favourites to win the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, in no particular order.\n\nIreland's 2024 Eurovision contestant Bambie Thug is a big favourite at this year's competition.\n\nBambie, who goes by they/them/their pronouns, is the first Irish contestant to make it through to a Eurovision final since 2018. They were voted through after the first semi-final thanks to their jaw-dropping performance of \"Doomsday Blue\", a dramatic composition that melds elements of industrial metal, pop, opera and techno.\n\n\"I think it's got something there for everyone,\" Bambie has said of their song. \"There's spoken word at the start, there's a pop chorus then there's a screamy part and there's a soulful, almost croony middle-eight, and then there's the electro-metal breakdown where I get to scream my lungs out. I'm just a show-off, basically!\"\n\n\"Doomsday Blues\" contains all the key elements of a hit Eurovision entry: it's bold, ambitious and includes excellent staging, with Bambie featured in witchy garb while surrounded by demonic-looking backing dancers.\n\nThe current favourite to win bears some similarities to Finland's 2023 runner-up Kaarji and his song \"Cha Cha Cha\", whom many believed was robbed of the crown by Sweden's Loreen.\n\nLike \"Cha Cha Cha\", Baby Lasagna's track \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" is a pulsating techno-influenced joyride, with a chugging guitar riff, pounding drums and singer Marko Puri\u0161i\u0107 singing in a deep growl: \"Ayy, I'm a big boy now/ I'm ready to leave, ciao, mamma, ciao/ Ayy, I'm a big boy now/ I'm going away and I sold my cow.\"\n\nThe staging for this is also nuts, with neon cows, goats and horses projected on the giant stage, pyrotechnics, a nun/washer woman who also dances, and a balaclava-clad band. There's even a patented dance move (a sort of march-on-the-spot with elbow-thrusting) and clapping interlude for fans to get involved in. Perfect Eurovision fodder, and very entertaining!\n\nSwiss delegate Nemo, who uses they/them/their pronouns, explores themes of gender identity with their elaborate anthem \"The Code\", which riffs cleverly on the Habanera aria from Georges Bizet's 1875 opera Carmen and will likely also draw comparisons to many of the classic James Bond themes.\n\nIt's suitably dramatic, with vocal trills, belts and some big falsetto notes towards the climax. Oh, and rapping. With their angelic face, gorgeous costumes and excellent live delivery, Nemo is another tough one to beat, and certainly a deserving winner.\n\nAngelina Mango has some big shoes to fill after the successes of past Italian delegates including rock band Maneskin, who won in 2021, hip-hop artist Mahmood, (who finished in second place in 2019, then in sixth place in 2022), and Marco Mengoni, who came fourth last year.\n\nWe're confident she'll do just fine, though, with her uplifting and carefree song \"La Noia\", which makes us long for hot summer days and heady nights thanks to its breezy guitar and Mango's catchy pop melodies.\n\nMango has already enjoyed success as a pop singer in Italy with singles including \"Che t'o dico a fa\" and \"Ci pensiamo domani\". She also happens to be the daughter of Laura Valente, former singer of the Italian pop band Matia Bazar, and the late Giuseppe Mango (known to fans simply as \"Mango\"), who tragically died after suffering a heart attack during a concert in 2014. Which means this will likely be a very emotional moment for Mango when she performs her song to the world.\n\nTali's French-language, Latin-inflected song is sure to charm the Eurovision voters when she performs it at the grand final. It's not dissimilar to Spanish contestant Chanel's 2022 crowd-pleaser \"SloMo\", with its sensuous dancing and immediately catchy chorus.\n\nInterestingly, she recalls Woodkid in the English-language section of the track, before ramping up the drama with, you guessed it, bursts of flame and some fantastic backing harmonies. Merveilleuse!\n\nMarina Satti has to be voted through to the second semi-final in order to win a place in the final on Saturday, but we're not worried. Her bop \"ZARI\" plays to her heritage and makes the most of her enchanting voice, redolent of Spanish star Rosalia.\n\nLike Rosalia, Satti also incorporates reggaeton, but also the Greek version of bagpipes, tsampouna, and plenty of vocoder on the vocals. It might sound strange to some listeners, but Satti and her co-writers have actually managed to pull off a very contemporary pop jam that could easily make its way onto our summer playlists.\n\nEurovision is never short of a club banger, and this year there are at least three for audience members to bop along to. One of our favourites is \"We Will Rave\" by Austria's Kaleen, who channels Cascada with her pulsating Noughties-style dance tune.\n\nIt's a breathless performance, so the only risk is that it struggles to stick in the audience's minds long enough to convince them to cast their votes, over arguably more memorable tracks from Croatia, Ireland and Switzerland.\n\nThat said, the racing synth beat is so undeniably catchy, and Kaleen's performance so confident, it's doubtful you'll be able to get this earworm out of your head for some time.\n\nUkraine's rousing 2024 anthem \"Teresa & Maria\" comes from Ukrainian singer-songwriter Jerry Heil, who rose to fame around 2019 with her hit song \"Okhrana otmjena\", along with her popular YouTube channel.\n\nMeanwhile, rapper and former teacher Alyona Alyona takes her influences from hip-hop stars such as Eminem, Nicki Minaj and Missy Elliot, and has been compared to Azealia Banks by The New York Times.\n\n\"Teresa & Maria\" is inspired by Roman Catholic saint Mother Teresa and the Virgin Mary, and delves into themes of responsibility, divinity and love. The duo sailed through the first semi-final, so you'll definitely get to see them competing on Saturday.\n\nAnother wild offering from everyone's favourite underdogs, who to date have only won the contest once since their debut performance in 1961. That was with Finnish metal band Lordi and their song \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\", still one of the most memorable Eurovision performances of all time.\n\n\"No Rules!\" by Windows95Man might just outdo them, however, thanks to duo Windows95Man's extraordinary staging, which includes a giant denim egg and some questionable costumes (or lack of).\n\nEurovision organisers will have to hope that he manages to avoid dropping his shorts during the very risque choreography at the grand final, after they were voted through the first semi-final on Tuesday 7 May.\n\nCompeting with Windows95Man, at least in terms of pure weirdness, is Joost and his Europop banger \"Europapa\".\n\nAs we mentioned, Eurovision is clearly trying to bring back the club banger; Joost is on hand with this relentless, loopy bop that flits from Dutch to English and mentions everything from \"escargots\" to \"fish and chips\". Do we understand it? No. Do we love it anyway? Absolutely.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest",

Meet the Azerbaijan Eurovision 2024 entry", "body": "While they haven't hit the top ten in the past few years, the country hopes its luck will change with FAHREE, featuring Ilkin Dovlatov.\n\nBut who exactly is FAHREE? Here's everything that you need to know.\n\nWhen it comes to FAHREE, artistry is in his blood. His father was a jazz drummer, while his grandfather was an esteemed actor.\n\nFor six years, FAHREE studied to become a lawyer, earning both a Bachelor's and Master's degree, but he ultimately realised that music was his passion in 2020 during lockdown. And we're so glad he did.\n\nFAHREE is 29 years old. He was born in 1995.\n\nWhen asked what he was looking forward to most in Sweden, FAHREE said: \"Being an artist outside of my homeland, and the reward of all the dedication and hard work my whole Eurovision journey represents.\"\n\nAzerbaijan's Eurovision song is \u00d6z\u00fcnl\u0259 Apar, a tune that is written by not just FAHREE, but also Edgar Ravin, Mado Salikh, Hasan Haydar, and Mila Miles.\n\nThe song incorporates mugham, a type of traditional Azerbaijani folklore music, along with more modern pop sounds.\n\nAfter coming 14th in the semi-final, Azerbaijan failed to qualify for the final. The country was represented by TuralTuranX with the song Tell Me More.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_colombo@radiotimes.com", "name": "Charlotte Colombo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijani folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugham", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mugham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/04/fahree-eurovision-ad973ab.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

However, he chose to don it just before the live broadcast, disregarding the apolitical nature of Eurovision.\n\nFollowing the backlash, the EBU decided to remove Saada's performance from social media platforms. Additionally, a senior official from the organization assured Israeli journalists that the incident would be thoroughly investigated to understand how it occurred despite the presence of numerous producers and stage workers.\n\nThe Israel Broadcasting Corporation has also sought clarification from the EBU regarding the matter, highlighting the significance of upholding the non-political stance of Eurovision.", "source": {"uri": "i24news.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "i24NEWS English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keffiyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Public_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Industry", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Industry", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://cdn.i24news.tv/uploads/c5/48/eb/9b/2d/b3/bb/ab/18/18/f5/79/5a/29/39/47/c548eb9b2db3bbab1818f5795a293947.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545894", "eventUri": "eng-9545894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Russia has not been back in the competition since, which is clear to me to be a decision informed by politics.\n\nAnd yet Israel has been allowed to remain in the competition, despite carrying out what leading experts - like Francesca Albanese, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Territories - call a 'crime of genocide'.\n\nAnd so, because the EBU will not remove Israel, I have decided to join in calls for the boycott.\n\nI was planning to host a big ticketed screening party in Dalston - with around 800 people in an auditorium screaming and cheering along - but I have since cancelled it.\n\nI'm very sad to be missing one of my favourite events of the year - and also feeling the effects financially by missing the work it would have provided - but it feels much more important and urgent to stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nIn my opinion, Israel's inclusion in the competition is pinkwashing at its finest.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the term, pinkwashing is a propaganda strategy that cynically exploits LGBTQ+ rights to project a progressive image, while concealing less popular actions.\n\nAs reported in The New York Times in 2011, Aeyal Gross - a professor of law at Tel Aviv University - argued that 'gay rights have essentially become a public-relations tool'. It came after revelations that the tourism board of Tel Aviv had reportedly begun a campaign of around $90million (\u00a371.5million) to brand the city as 'an international gay vacation destination'.\n\nAs an event with a huge gay audience, Eurovision fits perfectly into this campaign.\n\nIsrael seems to understand the cultural power of pinkwashing and the opportunity this competition represents to polish their international reputation with a sparkly pop performance. They even won the competition in 2018 with Netta's song, Toy.\n\nI believe Israel knows Eurovision can help to restore its image, which is why the country's president Isaac Herzog said in February: 'It is important for Israel to appear in Eurovision'.\n\nThis is why a boycott is more important than ever.\n\nEarlier this year, I co-signed an open letter, along with hundreds of other queer artists, encouraging Olly Alexander - the UK's entrant this year - to join us in boycotting. Olly is someone I really respect and who I've typically agreed with on political issues, but he's completely missed the mark in this case.\n\nHe posted a letter signed by eight of this year's other acts saying they 'stand in solidarity with the oppressed' and 'believe in the unifying power of music' and so have decided to remain in the competition. I feel this is a completely anaemic statement that says nothing.\n\nImagine the impact it would have made (and the solidarity shown) if all these artists had withdrawn instead.\n\nI empathise with his predicament - I have no idea about Olly's contract with the EBU, what repercussions he might have faced had he pulled out, and it's not fair that this amazing career opportunity is being tarnished by things outside of his control. That said, I'm also very disappointed in his completely milquetoast statement, and would argue that doing the right thing when it's hard is much more important than doing it when it's easy.\n\nThat's why I would urge Olly to reconsider - it's not too late to make a huge statement and use his platform for real good.\n\nSome people have argued that boycotting Eurovision has no real impact on the plight of Palestinians. This ignores that it is a group of Palestinian academics and leaders itself that has led calls for boycott the contest and therefore denies their agency.\n\nIt is also one of the key ways we can make our voices heard.\n\nThe power of boycotting was proven in South Africa, where it was one of the key levers that helped end apartheid. From being barred from sporting events, to musicians refusing to play in the country, to UK businesses refusing to import South African goods.\n\nAnd so, a concerted effort to exert pressure on Israel - financially, culturally and politically - is the best chance we have as everyday people of making a difference.\n\nEurovision is one small part of this movement, but represents an important opportunity to highlight the war, the hypocrisy of Israel's inclusion and to maintain pressure on western governments.\n\nAs queer people, we should not allow our dearest cultural institutions to be used to provide cover for Israel's actions, which have been met with allegations of genocide.\n\nI believe that the Palestinian people have a right to life, autonomy and self-determination. Until those rights are recognised, we should do everything we can to protest.\n\nSo please consider joining the boycott of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nAnd if you need to fill the Eurovision-shaped hole, you could copy my bootleg version.\n\nI'll be at home playing a selection of previous year's songs with a group of friends, offering our own Graham Norton-esque commentary, and orchestrating our own 'live' vote.\n\nDo you have a story you'd like to share?

But the concert may be only the second-best attended event in the city that evening; a pro-Palestinian protest, calling for Israel's removal from the contest, is expecting at least 20,000 attendees, and possibly far more.\n\nThe competition - which tries desperately to retain its \"apolitical\" tag - has become the largest cultural event so far to be rocked by the repercussions of Israel's war in Gaza. Israel's military assault has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza since it was launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Those protesting or boycotting the song contest claim it is \"artwashing\" the conflict; others defend Israel's inclusion, insisting the contest should not be dragged into geopolitics.\n\n\"Politics does influence the event from time to time,\" Paul Jordan, a fan and researcher of the contest who worked in its communications team from 2015 to 2018, told CNN. But this year, \"the presence of Israel has become such a big issue (that) I think it's going to overshadow the event,\" he said.\n\nWeeks of simmering tension over the question are coming to the fore in Malmo this week, ahead of the contest's semi-finals on Tuesday and Thursday. And they are leading to perhaps the tensest three minutes in the contest's history, when Israel's competitor, Eden Golan, performs live.\n\n\"We could well see protests in the arena, we could see booing,\" Jordan said. \"I would imagine the scale of it in Malmo would be bigger than anything we've ever seen before.\"\n\nAn increasingly political song contest\n\nIt is difficult to pierce the celebratory bubble that surrounds the competition each year. But even among Eurovision's media-managed contestants, there are some rumblings of discontent this time.\n\n\"It is frustrating. I don't agree with it at all. It doesn't make sense,\" Bambie Thug, Ireland's participant, told CNN of extensive rules restricting any form of pro-Palestinian statement during the event.\n\nThe singer previously released a statement resisting calls to boycott the event, saying they intended instead to provide a \"pro-Palestinian voice\" in Malmo. They told CNN that Israel's involvement in the competition was the \"wrong decision.\"\n\nFounded by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) in 1956 as a unity-fostering project between national broadcasters, Eurovision has been rocked and buffeted for decades by the continent's geopolitical currents. It offers an unrivaled soft power-building platform to member states with poor human rights records, like Azerbaijan and, until two years ago, Russia.\n\nThe completed Eurovision stage at Malmo Arena is shown at a press conference in Malmo, Sweden, on April 25, 2024. (Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency via AP, File)\n\nBut this year is the most difficult yet for the EBU, which decided against excluding Israel over the country's war in Gaza, whereas Russia was barred after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago - contrasting stances that led to calls of double standards.\n\n\"The two are not comparative at all,\" the EBU's director general, Noel Curran, told CNN, insisting that Israel's national broadcaster KAN did not breach the contest's rules as Russia's did, which is the ultimate test of eligibility for the contest.\n\n\"If we start across the board just deciding that we're going to exclude people, on the basis of geopolitical situations or terrible things that might be happening in the world, then every year we're just going to have groups of people calling for someone to be excluded - be it Azerbaijan, be it somebody else,\" Curran said.\n\n\"We want to try and keep the contest as non-political as we can,\" he added. \"And that's hard.\"\n\nHe may be understating matters. Publicists representing a swathe of Europe's most eccentric musical artists in Malmo have been especially cautious with their talent, seeking to protect them from questions relating to the protests taking place just a few yards from their hotels.\n\nCNN asked to interview Golan, Israel's performer, for this story, but was told it would only be arranged if CNN provided the questions beforehand, which goes against standard journalistic practices.\n\nThe EBU was already forced to intervene when Golan's initial song submission, \"October Rain,\" was deemed to too closely reference Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.\n\nAnd the EBU has worked hard to keep dissent from seeping into Malmo Arena. Long-standing rules preventing flags of non-competing countries and territories mean that Palestinian flags are banned from the crowd, which Bambie Thug told CNN they \"100 per cent\" disagreed with.\n\nArtists are not allowed to make statements either, though some may risk the punishment - a fine for their broadcaster - to do so, as Iceland's act did in 2019, when they held up Palestinian flags during the contest, which was held in Israel.\n\n\"We wouldn't want them to do that, quite obviously,\" Curran said. \"That is not something that we want artists to do, and it's in the rules that they shouldn't do that, and can't do that.\"\n\nWhen asked by CNN, the EBU did not rule out adjusting sound levels on the broadcast to obscure booing, if it occurs during the Israeli performance.\n\nBut, for all their efforts, Eurovision bosses will hold their breaths while Golan sings in Saturday's grand final if, as expected, she progresses from Thursday's semi-final.\n\n\"The real worry would be any threat of violence, particularly towards the singers,\" Jordan said. \"The worst nightmare could be a stage invasion.\" The latter occurred during the United Kingdom's performance in 2018, when a man snatched the microphone from singer SuRie and screamed a message before being removed.\n\n'It has divided the city'\n\nAs Malmo sought to stage a week's worth of events and performances to celebrate Eurovision, it encountered a problem: artists kept dropping out, following pressure from pro-Palestinian groups urging a boycott of the contest.\n\n\"It has divided the city, in a way,\" admitted Karin Karlsson, who is in charge of staging the events in Malmo. \"I don't think we will solve any questions when it comes to the war in Gaza by boycotting,\" she said.\n\nIn total, she said 20 artists had dropped out of performing in the city. But Karlsson is undeterred. \"I sleep well,\" she said. \"I want to show everybody a vibrant, super diverse city, where we can live side by side but still think differently.\"\n\nShe hopes that Malmo is on track to fulfilling that goal. \"But you never know. It's uncertain at the moment.\"\n\nHer efforts may have been complicated by the choice of host. \"(Malmo) has this history of resistance and solidarity, and it's a working class city, but at the same time the municipality has tried to rebrand Malmo as a more global city,\" Elina Pahnke, a Malmo-based journalist covering culture for the Aftonbladet newspaper, told CNN.\n\nThat has caused tensions with some residents, she said, who want resources and time spent on public services, rather than international spectacles.\n\nThe city is also home to large Muslim and Palestinian populations. Weekly pro-Palestinian protests have been held since Israel's war in Gaza began in October, and the protest during Saturday's live final could be the biggest since those early weeks.\n\n\"We hope to show the EBU that the people of Malmo reject their attempt at artwashing,\" said Mohammad Ghannam, who has led the movement to boycott Eurovision as part of Sweden's Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) group.\n\nA massive security operation is in place; a Swedish police spokesperson told CNN it was one of the largest Malmo has ever seen, and involves officers from Denmark and Norway as well as Sweden.\n\nAnd last week, Israel's National Security Council raised its travel warning to Malmo, urging Israelis planning to attend Eurovision to reconsider whether they need to do so. It cited \"tangible concern that terrorists will exploit the protest and the anti-Israel atmosphere to carry out an attack on Israelis,\" and described Malmo as a hub for \"anti-Israel protests.\"\n\nLara Yosef, a 30-year-old Syrian migrant to Malmo who will be attending Saturday's demonstration, said that when she walks past Eurovision advertising in her city, \"I see blood.\"\n\n\"I'm hoping that some artists will surprise us and (make) some statements on stage,\" Yosef said.\n\nAmid those tensions, some artists have complained of online harassment and abuse, while others have praised the pro-Palestinian demonstrators. \"Power to them for protesting,\" Bambie Thug said, before their media manager quickly asked CNN to return to questions centred on their music.\n\nBut many more are working to block out what is becoming a near-deafening distraction, joining Eurovision's organizers in offering delicate comments. \"(Our) sympathy is (with) all people who say that war is s--t,\" said Ukrainian contestant Alyona Alyona. \"Because who, if not we, can say what is war, and how s--t it is?\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title":

The city already expected about 100,000 fans to visit, and amped up security for the event in anticipation of thousands of people protesting Israel's participation in the contest. Protests are expected to take place Thursday and Saturday, coinciding with the competition's second semi-final and the grand final, Associated Press reported.\n\n\"I think it's obvious that the world's insecurity has also affected Eurovision,\" Malmo Police Chief Petra Stenkula told BBC a few days before the event began. \"In Sweden, and Malmo in particular, there have been protests against Israel taking part in the competition.\"\n\nWhile Stenkula told BBC that there were no specific threats to the contest, additional security officials have been called in from across Sweden, in addition to Denmark and Norway. Some officers may carry larger weapons as a precaution, and officials have also set up cameras around the venue.\n\nSweden had already been \"on a terror level of four out of five,\" Stenkula told BBC. The country increased the alert level in August 2023, after a spate of Quran-burning incidents sparked outrage and triggered protests in many Muslim-majority countries.\n\nMore than 150 million people from around the world watch Eurovision. Organizers insist the event is apolitical, and recently branded it with the slogan \"United by Music.\" Organizers have long banned most flags and signs from the contest -- the only exceptions are participants' national flags and the pride flag, meaning that Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols are not allowed inside the Malmo Arena venue.\n\nJean Philip De Tender is the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the competition, and he told Sky News that barring Israel from the competition \"would have been a political decision, and as such (one) which we cannot take.\"\n\nOrganizers did previously tell Israel to change the lyrics of its song, initially called \"October Rain,\" because of its apparent reference to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,200 Israelis. Organizers had said that they would disqualify participants who didn't abide by Eurovision's apolitical nature, according to Reuters.

Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT), the live shows' presenters are Swedish comedian Petra Mede and Hollywood actress Malin \u00c5kerman. 37 countries are participating - with Luxembourg returning for the first time since 1993 and Romania opting out this year.\n\nIsrael's participation was met with criticism among Eurovision participants and fans, due to the context of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war; due to protests and petitions calling for its removal, organisers strengthened the security measures for the event.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the running order for the first semi-final was as follows (listed by nation, artist and song name):\n\nThe first countries in the semi-final who qualified for the final were: Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland, Cyprus, Croatia, Ireland and Luxembourg.\n\nSerbia's moody, soulful and mournful ballad sung by TEYA DORA, Ramonda, qualified first. Secondly, Portugal's iolanda convinced the viewers with her powerful voice and impressive vocals amidst stark, black and white visuals. Thirdly, Slovenian singer Raiven interpreted the song \"Veronika\" with high energy amidst a striking water-animated stage.\n\nUkraine had alyona alyona and Jerry Heil performing a power ballad with beautifully complementary vocals, a catchy melody and surprising elements such as rap and visually compelling outfits (somewhere between a princess gown and hint of armour, shine and elegance combined with a martial aesthetic).\n\nLithuania's Silvester Belt performed a high-energy, electronic dance in blue and red - \"Luktelk\" had melodic elements but was perhaps among the heaviest on the beats among all the qualifiers. Meanwhile, Finland's humorous performance had Windows95man's emerging with no trousers on from a giant cracking egg while singing the song \"No Rules!\". Cyprus' Silia Kapsis delivered a high-energy, smooth and dancerly performance with \"Liar\".\n\nCroatia's Baby Lasagna wowed the audience with a memorable rock anthem, high-energy, with creative, playful costumes seemingly inspired by traditional national clothing. Last but not least, Ireland's Bambie Thug performed a highly unsettling electro-metal piece with elaborate costumes and makeup reminiscent of a supernatural horror film aesthetic. Luxembourg's TALI was announced last in a tense moment for the Grand Duchy's Eurovision lovers; in this performance, \"Fighter\" was performed with a slightly softer side showing. TALI's voice shines brighter in the semi-finals, though she brings the same energy that convinced the voters the last time around.\n\nThe semi-final results were determined through televotes. The televote took place during the live broadcast of the show. The fifteen participating countries, as well as Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom, were voting in this semi-final.\n\nAnother ten countries will qualify on Thursday out of sixteen to perform. Yesterday's ten successful qualifiers will join the qualifiers from the second semi-final. As the biggest donors to the EBU, the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy already have secured their spots in the final on Saturday along with host country's Sweden's contestant Marcus & Martinus.",

The contest is polarising, stirring great enthusiasm among its devoted fanbase, but also leaving its critics shaking their heads in disapproval. Love it or hate it, each May, the ESC is all over the media and practically inescapable. It even has a solid fan base in Australia and the USA thanks to its entertainment value, variety, and diversity. The number of participating countries has swelled from just seven contestants (Switzerland, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Germany at the first contest in Lugano in 1956) to an all-time total of fifty. According to the European Broadcasting Union, 162 million viewers watched the broadcasts of the final and the two semi-finals in 2023, making the ESC the largest music competition in the world.\n\nThe beginnings: Le Grand Prix\n\nIn 1956, however, things looked and sounded quite different. Most followers listened to The Grand Prix on their radio sets at home, which means that back then, the word \"grand\" may have referred to quality rather than scope. The live audience in the concert hall appeared in suits and evening gowns. The European Broadcasting Union launched the contest in an effort to boost the domestic music market. To be eligible, an entry had to be an original composition of no more than three minutes. The contestants were neither the countries nor the performers, but the composers, commissioned by their respective national broadcaster. Of course, this aspect has been somewhat lost today. In any case, we should note that to this day, there are no rules regarding either the composers' national origin, nor the language of the song lyrics. (A language rule was in place from 1966 to 1972 and from 1977 to 1998, however.) The Eurovision format fed the young medium of television entertaining programming content that was accessible in the Member Countries of the European Broadcasting Union across different languages. As more and more households purchased TV sets in the 1950s and 1960s, a growing audience was able to watch the contest on television.\n\nThe community-building and emotional effect of music could well set the mood for a broader political consent.\n\nBack then, the orchestra and conductor were important musical and visual features of the performances. It not only impacted the sound and style of the songs (mainly chansons and Schlager), but also symbolically celebrated cultural dialog as the baton passed ceremoniously from one conductor to the next. The main objective was to leverage the language of music to promote cultural exchange across national language barriers. A televised musical entertainment programme seemed to be an adequate medium to create communities around the medium. Although the event was a contest, its intent was by no means to stir any political or national rivalries. To this day, the rules of the Eurovision Song Contest expressly prohibit political content in the songs and performances. A mere decade after the end of World War II, the need to seek comfort in seemingly apolitical popular music is understandable. But is it a coincidence that the very same countries that participated in the first Grand Prix (except Switzerland) signed the Treaty of Rome ten months later in March 1957, laying the foundations for the European Union? Music may not be able to prompt political decisions, but its community-building and emotional effect could well set the mood for a broader political consent.\n\nEurovision as a mirror of the socio-political status quo\n\nIn many ways, the almost 70-year history of the Eurovision Song Contest reads like a seismograph of the socio-political situation in Europe and beyond. The performances, the presence or absence of certain countries, the winning acts, the hosts' commentary, and the news coverage all reflect European post-war history as well as processes of division and integration. If you listen closely, events such as the Prague Spring, street riots in Belfast, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, the end of the Franco dictatorship, the Cyprus conflict, the eastward expansion of the European Union, the Orange Revolution, and the war of aggression in Ukraine all echo in some of the songs. To name just two examples: In 1982, Nicole sang \"Ein bi\u00dfchen Frieden\" (A little bit of peace) in four languages, capturing the spirit of the times and the longing for peaceful coexistence in the shadow of the NATO missile crisis. In 1990, Toto Cotugno's anthem \"Insieme - Unite, unite Europe\" captured the hopeful and joyful mood after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 2022, the political dimension of the media spectacle became clearer than ever when Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra won the contest in a landslide and the United Kingdom stepped in as host country the following year.\n\nIn 2022, the political dimension of the media spectacle became clearer than ever.\n\nYet as we know, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia began much earlier, both in brutal reality and in the media utopia that celebrates community and transcends borders. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the competition barely responded to the event. Both the Ukrainian and Russian contestants delivered their entries, which had been selected long before the aggression. It wasn't the Ukrainian singer, but Austrian winner Conchita Wurst who became the target of hostility from Russian conservatives. In the following year, the war in Donbass prevented Ukraine from participating. Yet their absence from the competition went largely unnoticed - quite symptomatic of Europe's general response to Russia's acts of oppression. In 2016, Ukraine was back on the Eurovision stage and making its voice heard all the louder with Jamala's song \"1944,\" a tale about her family history and the deportation of Crimean Tatars as well as a call for more humanity. Forty-two participants answered that call the following year when Kyiv hosted the contest for the second time. Russia did not participate. It was only after the Russian attack on Ukraine on February 25, 2022, that the Reference Group of the Eurovision Song Contest decided to suspend Russia for disregarding the values of the contest: cultural understanding, diversity, and peaceful coexistence. The Ukrainian delegation was flooded with expressions of solidarity. Their song \"Stefania\" was inevitably received as a protest song, even though it was composed well before the invasion. Did the Kalush Orchestra win only because of empathy for and solidarity with Ukraine? Or was it actually a solid composition and a great performance? The song combined different cultural elements: folkloric vocals in the chorus, modern rap in the stanzas, and an instrumental hook on the telenka. The performers were a diverse group of six men, dressed in both traditional garb and modern clothes. They encouraged the audience to dance, clap, and sing along with their performance, even though only few understood the lyrics.\n\nMusical diversity\n\nIn fact, it is precisely this eclectic cultural diversity that makes the contest and its entries so attractive. Just looking at and listening to the Ukrainian contributions since their debut in 2003, the musical diversity of the songs is striking: They are an eclectic mix of ethnopop, hip hop, techno, disco, folklore, pop ballads, trip hop, and rock. They innovatively integrate traditional musical elements like folkloristic flutes, historical vocals, and specific harmonies. The entire 70-year history of the ESC and with its over 1,600 songs constitutes a rich and unique visual and musical archive of recent music history in Europe and beyond, whose hallmark is musical and cultural diversity. The ESC started out with chansons and Schlager. Today, the entries cover all possible varieties of popular music. In addition to the above-mentioned genres, they also cover jazz, blues, disco, gospel, Latin, Balkan pop, reggae, heavy metal, EDM, opera, and singer-songwriter compositions.\n\nIt is precisely this eclectic cultural diversity that makes the contest and its entries so attractive.\n\nA perusal of the archive shows that over the decades, the music of the contest has always been evolving, absorbing new trends in popular culture. In the early 70s, youth culture began to permeate the rather serious affair that the ESC had been in the 50s and 60s. The 80s were all about fashion and style. By the end of the 90s, in one of the most drastic visual and musical changes in the history of the composer-based contest, the live orchestra was replaced by a playback. However, this change also allowed for greater musical and creative freedom and more modern instruments and synthesizer sounds. The stage design also kept getting more creative, elaborate, complex, and technical from year to year. Today, the artistic design is a key vehicle to help convey the impact and message of the songs.\n\nIn addition to musical and performative developments, historical footage from the contest is also an inventory of technical innovation over the last seven decades. Camera work and technology has changed, the quality of live broadcasts has improved, and their reach has increased. All these developments are preserved in the archive of ESC entries for everyone to hear and see. Today, the Eurovision Song Contest is an immersive audiovisual media spectacle leveraging the latest digital technologies.\n\nUnited in diversity\n\nAs more and more countries joined the contest, the ESC stage became ever more diverse and colourful. Anything was possible, no matter how crazy and weird, as long as it stayed within the three-minute limit. Global trends and local styles have converged in the performances, generating many surprising acts. Time and again, the acts feature visual and musical elements that refer to specific cultural traditions in the presenting countries. The success of such national elements does not depend on their authenticity, but rather on how the material, which sounds and looks exotic to outsiders, is combined with the familiar. Overall, this broad musical diversity can be read as a musical mirror of the cultural diversity of Europe and beyond, as well as for the diversity across various generations of audiences that have come together over decades to form one media community.\n\nIn general, this media spectacle is all about engaging the audience, stirring emotion through music, surprising the audience, and perhaps even making them laugh (or shake their heads). With their performances, the contestants want to leave a lasting impression and make the audience feel like they are part of this Eurovision community. Music is the vehicle that instils this sense of community. Viewers in front of tv sets and other screens become part of this community, which is centred in Europe, but radiates to various other parts of the world. They feel connected to each other and can interact with the live event by televoting. It is interesting to note the different status of the ESC in different countries and the level of attention it has received in different years. This has not yet been empirically studied, but the longevity of the contest proves that there has been continuous interest in it, manifesting itself in both enthusiasm and criticism. Everyone seems to have an opinion on the ESC, and every opinion is valid as long as it doesn't conflict with the values of cultural diversity, openness, tolerance, and integration. You don't have to like a performance, but you should appreciate the composers' and performers' hard work, creativity, and effort that goes into each entry. Some performances may even provoke extreme reactions and polarise intentionally. But in the end, it's the same music that unites Eurovision fans. The fact that everyone can be their authentic selves, both on stage and in the audience, is a small achievement of the ESC that has hardly ever been possible in any other context of such scope and public impact. The ESC offers space for grand emotions, the idea of justice, and equal gender representation. So does that mean that an ESC song can change the world? Not likely. But it can make the world seem like a better place, at least for a moment. Can the Eurovision Song Contest exist in an apolitical vacuum? It certainly cannot. On the contrary, ESC officials should be aware of its political dimension and address it responsibly. As utopian as it may seem, the contest can offer an alternative setting where a heterogeneous community comes together every year to promote cultural diversity and understanding. Even if it is only once a year, for one Saturday evening.", "source": {"uri": "boell.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heinrich-B\u00f6ll-Stiftung"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But the concert may be only the second-best attended event in the city that evening; a pro-Palestinian protest, calling for Israel's removal from the contest, is expecting at least 20,000 attendees, and possibly far more.\n\nThe competition - which tries desperately to retain its \"apolitical\" tag - has become the largest cultural event so far to be rocked by the repercussions of Israel's war in Gaza. Israel's military assault has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza since it was launched in response to Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Those protesting or boycotting the song contest claim it is \"artwashing\" the conflict; others defend Israel's inclusion, insisting the contest should not be dragged into geopolitics.\n\n\"Politics does influence the event from time to time,\" Paul Jordan, a fan and researcher of the contest who worked in its communications team from 2015 to 2018, told CNN. But this year, \"the presence of Israel has become such a big issue (that) I think it's going to overshadow the event,\" he said.\n\nWeeks of simmering tension over the question are coming to the fore in Malmo this week, ahead of the contest's semi-finals on Tuesday and Thursday. And they are leading to perhaps the tensest three minutes in the contest's history, when Israel's competitor, Eden Golan, performs live.\n\n\"We could well see protests in the arena, we could see booing,\" Jordan said. \"I would imagine the scale of it in Malmo would be bigger than anything we've ever seen before.\"\n\nEden Golan, Israel's participant. Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters\n\nAn increasingly political song contest\n\nIt is difficult to pierce the celebratory bubble that surrounds the competition each year. But even among Eurovision's media-managed contestants, there are some rumblings of discontent this time.\n\n\"It is frustrating. I don't agree with it at all. It doesn't make sense,\" Bambie Thug, Ireland's participant, told CNN of extensive rules restricting any form of pro-Palestinian statement during the event.\n\nThe singer previously released a statement resisting calls to boycott the event, saying they intended instead to provide a \"pro-Palestinian voice\" in Malmo. They told CNN that Israel's involvement in the competition was the \"wrong decision.\"\n\nFounded by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) in 1956 as a unity-fostering project between national broadcasters, Eurovision has been rocked and buffeted for decades by the continent's geopolitical currents. It offers an unrivaled soft power-building platform to member states with poor human rights records, like Azerbaijan and, until two years ago, Russia.\n\nBut this year is the most difficult yet for the EBU, which decided against excluding Israel over the country's war in Gaza, whereas Russia was barred after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago - contrasting stances that led to calls of double standards.\n\nIreland's Bambie Thug told CNN they disagreed with Israel's involvement in the competition. Patricia J. Garcinuno/Getty Images\n\n\"The two are not comparative at all,\" the EBU's director general, Noel Curran, told CNN, insisting that Israel's national broadcaster KAN did not breach the contest's rules as Russia's did, which is the ultimate test of eligibility for the contest.\n\n\"If we start across the board just deciding that we're going to exclude people, on the basis of geopolitical situations or terrible things that might be happening in the world, then every year we're just going to have groups of people calling for someone to be excluded - be it Azerbaijan, be it somebody else,\" Curran said.\n\n\"We want to try and keep the contest as non-political as we can,\" he added. \"And that's hard.\"\n\nHe may be understating matters. Publicists representing a swathe of Europe's most eccentric musical artists in Malmo have been especially cautious with their talent, seeking to protect them from questions relating to the protests taking place just a few yards from their hotels.\n\nCNN asked to interview Golan, Israel's performer, for this story, but was told it would only be arranged if CNN provided the questions beforehand, which goes against standard journalistic practices.\n\nThe EBU was already forced to intervene when Golan's initial song submission, \"October Rain,\" was deemed to too closely reference Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators in Stockholm, Sweden's capital, demand Israel's exclusion from Eurovision. Fredrik Persson/TT News Agency/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd the EBU has worked hard to keep dissent from seeping into Malmo Arena. Long-standing rules preventing flags of non-competing countries and territories mean that Palestinian flags are banned from the crowd, which Bambie Thug told CNN they \"100%\" disagreed with.\n\nArtists are not allowed to make statements either, though some may risk the punishment - a fine for their broadcaster - to do so, as Iceland's act did in 2019, when they held up Palestinian flags during the contest, which was held in Israel.\n\n\"We wouldn't want them to do that, quite obviously,\" Curran said. \"That is not something that we want artists to do, and it's in the rules that they shouldn't do that, and can't do that.\"\n\nWhen asked by CNN, the EBU did not rule out adjusting sound levels on the broadcast to obscure booing, if it occurs during the Israeli performance.\n\nBut, for all their efforts, Eurovision bosses will hold their breaths while Golan sings in Saturday's grand final if, as expected, she progresses from Thursday's semi-final.\n\n\"The real worry would be any threat of violence, particularly towards the singers,\" Jordan said. \"The worst nightmare could be a stage invasion.\" The latter occurred during the United Kingdom's performance in 2018, when a man snatched the microphone from singer SuRie and screamed a message before being removed.\n\n'It has divided the city'\n\nAs Malmo sought to stage a week's worth of events and performances to celebrate Eurovision, it encountered a problem: artists kept dropping out, following pressure from pro-Palestinian groups urging a boycott of the contest.\n\n\"It has divided the city, in a way,\" admitted Karin Karlsson, who is in charge of staging the events in Malmo. \"I don't think we will solve any questions when it comes to the war in Gaza by boycotting,\" she said.\n\nIn total, she said 20 artists had dropped out of performing in the city. But Karlsson is undeterred. \"I sleep well,\" she said. \"I want to show everybody a vibrant, super diverse city, where we can live side by side but still think differently.\"\n\nShe hopes that Malmo is on track to fulfilling that goal. \"But you never know. It's uncertain at the moment.\"\n\nHer efforts may have been complicated by the choice of host. \"(Malmo) has this history of resistance and solidarity, and it's a working class city, but at the same time the municipality has tried to rebrand Malmo as a more global city,\" Elina Pahnke, a Malmo-based journalist covering culture for the Aftonbladet newspaper, told CNN. This has caused tensions with some residents, she explained.\n\nKeeping Eurovision apolitical has become a difficult task for Malmo's organizers. Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe city is home to large Muslim and Palestinian populations. Weekly pro-Palestinian protests have been held since Israel's war in Gaza began in October, and the protest during Saturday's live final could be the biggest since those early weeks.\n\n\"We hope to show the EBU that the people of Malmo reject their attempt at artwashing,\" said Mohammad Ghannam, who has led the movement to boycott Eurovision as part of Sweden's Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) group.\n\nA massive security operation is in place; a Swedish police spokesperson told CNN it was one of the largest Malmo has ever seen, and involves officers from Denmark and Norway as well as Sweden.\n\nAnd last week, Israel's National Security Council raised its travel warning to Malmo, urging Israelis planning to attend Eurovision to reconsider whether they need to do so. It cited \"tangible concern that terrorists will exploit the protest and the anti-Israel atmosphere to carry out an attack on Israelis,\" and described Malmo as a hub for \"anti-Israel protests.\"\n\nLara Yosef, a 30-year-old Syrian migrant to Malmo who will be attending Saturday's demonstration, said that when she walks past Eurovision advertising in her city, \"I see blood.\"\n\n\"I'm hoping that some artists will surprise us and (make) some statements on stage,\" Yosef said.\n\nAmid those tensions, some artists have complained of online harassment and abuse, while others have praised the pro-Palestinian demonstrators. \"Power to them for protesting,\" Bambie Thug said, before their media manager quickly asked CNN to return to questions centered on their music.\n\nBut many more are working to block out what is becoming a near-deafening distraction, joining Eurovision's organizers in offering delicate comments. \"(Our) sympathy is (with) all people who say that war is sh*t,\" said Ukrainian contestant Alyona Alyona. \"Because who, if not we, can say what is war, and how sh*t it is?\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This performance by the organization of the contest was highly applauded by the followers, which is why they expected it to be repeated against Netanyahu's territory.\n\nHowever, as we have seen, the vast majority of countries and their governments have not shown a clear position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and have not exerted pressure to stop the Israeli candidacy in the song festival.\n\nYesterday, during the broadcast of the first semi-final, Eurovision decided to open the gala with a performance by three great artists: Eleni Foureira (representative of Cyprus in 2018), Chanel (representative of Spain in 2022) and Eric Saade (representative of Sweden in 2011). ). Although the shows were highly applauded on social networks, Saade decided to sing with a Palestinian scarf (kufiya) tied to his arm, a gesture that caught the attention of all the show's viewers.\n\nThe action of the Swede of Palestinian origin caused a whirlwind of news internationally and placed the discussion of the conflict on the front line of the media. For its part, the EBU spoke out and expressed being very disappointed with the young man's attitude. In addition, the organization censored his actions on the pageant's official social networks.\n\nAfter a few hours of nerves, emotions and controversies, the singer uploaded a story to his official Instagram account in which he revealed that he does not regret what he did and that he is proud to support the Palestinian people on such a big stage. like Eurovision.\n\n''Reminder: it's just love. United by the music,'' the performer has written on a black background, ironically quoting the official slogan of this edition United by the music.\n\nIn a message to the Swedish media SVT News, the 33-year-old explained that the shawl he wore on stage is a gift that his father gave him as a child so he would never forget where his family comes from.\n\n''(...) I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something authentic to me, but the EBU seems to find my ethnicity controversial.

This week she will perform on another televised song contest when she represents her country in the Eurovision Song Contest, which normally reaches a worldwide audience in the hundreds of millions.\n\nOne year after interviewing Nutsa in Hollywood during her time on Idol, Billboard sat down with her again, this time in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, to talk about her life since then and what will be the biggest moment of her career so far.\n\nWhen we talked last year in California, I suggested you sing for Georgia in Eurovision, and here you are. What have the last 12 months been like for you?\n\nFirst of all, American Idol was the biggest thing I've done in my life. They gave me an open door to new opportunities. Like Lionel [Richie] said to me, \"It doesn't matter what number, you're a star.\" American Idol was a starter for my international career. Being on Idol makes your life much easier because people look at you and say you're the real deal. I have an agent in America and he had me perform the National Anthem at a Lakers game and a Dodgers game. I had an amazing summer living in Miami and was in the Hamptons for a weekend when a producer [with Georgia's national broadcaster] called and said, \"Nutsa, we are thinking of having you represent your country at Eurovision. When are you coming to Georgia?\"\n\nSo you said yes to Eurovision?\n\nI told them I only had one condition: I'm going to be involved with every little detail. And they said, \"Yes, for sure. We want you to be at your best. We want you to sing the song that you love to sing.\" So I had the freedom to be myself and not someone that they want me to be and that is the greatest thing they've done for me. And it's coming from the director of the broadcast.\n\nYou're singing \"Firefighter\" as the Georgian entry. Who found the song?\n\nWe had an open call. We received amazing songs, and we listened to all 300 of them. We had three favorites, and we chose one that I feel very confident in. \"Firefighter\" was from Darko Dimitrov, a Macedonian producer who has a lot of experience in Eurovision. The writer of the lyrics was Ada Skitka from Estonia. I really loved the song, but only the chorus. I flew from Miami to Macedonia, and we spent three days in the studio finishing the song. It was a very creative process.\n\nWhat does representing Georgia in Eurovision mean to you?\n\nI have loved my country ever since I was a very little girl. Because of my country's history and our people, I want to make them proud. I want to show the world how great Georgia is and how many talented people we have. We are a very small nation and that makes me more motivated to put Georgia on the map everywhere I can. Because especially in America, they think that Georgia is a state.\n\nYou competed on Idol and now you're competing again in Eurovision. What are your thoughts about the competition?\n\nI don't really think of it as a competition, to be honest. I do it for my career and I do it to become better and to have more experience, because all my life I wanted to have a career where you can go everywhere and sing everywhere. Not only in my country, but everywhere. I think big competitions give you the possibilities to be heard by millions and millions of people and that's the main reason I'm doing it. I don't like to compete with anybody. The only person I'm competing with always is myself, because I always want to do something bigger and better.\n\nWat was the main lesson you learned during your run on American Idol?\n\nOn American Idol, I realized that I had done hard work before, but Idol is the hardest work. I pushed myself to the limits. When I was in my hotel room, I cried because I was so exhausted from the emotions. By the time we were doing the live shows, it was better. I became friends with the contestants and then I became friends with the crew.\n\nWhat are your plans for your career after Eurovision?\n\nMy new single is coming out on May 12. I shot a music video before flying to Malm\u00f6. The song is called \"Mother's Day\" and I'm releasing it on Mother's Day. It's about my mom and she is in the music video with me. I'm sure a lot of people are going to cry because I love my mother very much and I wanted to have a song about her.\n\nWhat else lies ahead?\n\nThere is other news I haven't told anybody, so I've saved it for Billboard. I've been invited to audition for Broadway on May 11 [the same day as Eurovision]. So I need to go to New York as soon as possible for that.\n\nCan you tell me for what show?\n\nI don't think they want me to. It's a modern musical. The character that they want me to play is very near to who I am in real life and the voice of that character in the songs is my style.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news",

Among the proposals that have passed the qualifying round are Croatia, the big favorite, and the extravagance of Finland.\n\nSpain has not had to fight for a place, since it belongs to the Big Five and is directly classified. However, Nebulossa will demonstrate that his proposal is on par with that of his rivals in the second semi-final, where 16 other countries will fight to obtain the last ten places next Thursday, May 9.\n\nYoung S\u00edlia Kapsis has managed to help Cyprus qualify for the final and also become one of the main contenders to take home the trophy. The Liar proposal, which addresses an old love by calling him a liar, has been very popular.\n\nOne of the surprises has been the proposal from Ireland, which is carried out by Bambie Thug. The first images of the Eurovision rehearsals already warned that the Irish could surprise with their Ouija pop style. Bambie not only incorporates satanic elements in Doomsday Blue, but also makes a clear allusion to the trans struggle.\n\nAlyona Alyona\n\nAnother who has qualified for the Eurovision final is Silvester Belt for Lithuania, performing Luktelk, an electronic song entirely in Lithuanian. He is notable for being the first LGBTI artist to represent a country where same-sex marriage is not yet legal.\n\nThe song No Rules! by Windows95man represents Finland this year and stands out for his energetic rhythm and catchy electronic pop melody. Despite the eccentricity of the duo formed by DJ Teemu Keister and Henri Piispanen, which was rejected outright by the Finnish professional jury, they will face each other with Nebulossa.\n\nOn the other hand, the Croatian Baby Lasagna is positioned as the main candidate to win Eurovision. At least that's what the betting houses say, something that doesn't have to come true. With his song Rim Tim Tagi Dim he has shown that music can be a platform to address serious issues such as mental health and youth emigration while still entertaining.\n\nIn addition, Luxembourg has returned to Eurovision stomping after a 30-year absence thanks to Tali and her Fighter. The Portuguese Iolanda and Grito de ella have also managed to pass the eliminatory.

It could only mean one thing: Eurovision is back. Everyone's favorite European singing competition kicked off May 7, with two more nights to go on May 9 and May 11. And if there's ever been a year to watch, this might be it. One of Eurovision's most successful countries, Sweden, is hosting, and you might even recognize a few of the performers, like U.K. entry Olly Alexander of Years and Years. Plus, there are some truly fun songs. There's controversy, too, with protests against Israel's entry amid the ongoing war in Gaza. Below, everything you need to know about Eurovision 2024, including how to watch.\n\nIt's like the Olympics plus American Idol, except if everyone wrote their own songs. Eurovision is put on by the European Broadcasting Union, and countries enter via their own national broadcasters. Each country enters an original song that has either been pre-chosen or won a national competition. Singers then perform those songs live in two semifinal rounds and a final, where they compete for points from each country's jury as well as viewer votes. The winning country gets to host next year's competition, and the winning performer just might become the next Celine Dion.\n\nThere's still one semifinal round to go, where 15 countries will face off and the top ten will move on. Below, the remaining semifinalists -- including Vulture's favorite, Austria, and Israel's controversial entry.\n\nMalta: \"Loop,\" Sarah Bonnici\n\nAlbania: \"Titan,\" Besa\n\nGreece: \"Zari,\" Marina Satti\n\nSwitzerland: \"The Code,\" Nemo\n\nCzechia: \"Pedestal,\" Aiko\n\nAustria: \"We Will Rave,\" Kaleen\n\nDenmark: \"Sand,\" Saba\n\nArmenia: \"Jako,\" Ladaniva\n\nLatvia: \"Hollow,\" Dons\n\nSan Marino: \"11:11,\" Megara\n\nGeorgia: \"Firefighter,\" Nutsa Buzaladze\n\nBelgium: \"Before the Party's Over,\" Mustii\n\nEstonia: \"(Nendest) narkootikumidest ei tea me (k\u00fcll) midagi,\" 5miinust and Puuluup\n\nIsrael: \"Hurricane,\" Eden Golan\n\nNorway: \"Ulveham,\" G\u00e5te\n\nNetherlands: \"Europapa,\" Joost Klein\n\nTen countries already made it to the final after May 7's semi (including Croatia's wonderfully named Baby Lasagna, the current favorite to win). They join the always-in Big Five (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), plus this year's host, Sweden. So don't worry that you missed the first semifinal -- you'll see these ones again.\n\nSweden: \"Unforgettable,\" Marcus and Martinus\n\nGermany: \"Always on the Run,\" Isaak\n\nIreland: \"Doomsday Blue,\" Bambie Thug\n\nLithuania: \"Luktelk,\" Silvester Belt\n\nLuxembourg: \"Fighter,\" Tali\n\nUnited Kingdom: \"Dizzy,\" Olly Alexander\n\nCyprus: \"Liar,\" Silia Kapsis\n\nFinland: \"No Rules!\" Windows95man\n\nFrance: \"Mon amour,\" Slimane\n\nSlovenia: \"Veronika,\" Raiven\n\nCroatia: \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim,\" Baby Lasagna\n\nItaly: \"La noia,\" Angelina Mango\n\nPortugal: \"Grito,\" Iolanda\n\nSerbia: \"Ramonda,\" Teya Dora\n\nSpain: \"Zorra,\" Nebulossa\n\nUkraine: \"Teresa & Maria,\" Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil\n\nAs ever. This year's issue centers around Israel's participation in the competition, as the country continues to wage war in Gaza. The EBU has defended Israel, but viewers in other countries have petitioned for the country to be disqualified. (That wouldn't be unheard of, after Russia was disqualified just two years ago amid the war in Ukraine.) Now, with Israel participating, activists have called on a number of countries' performers to boycott the festival instead, though none have obliged. Even Israel's song is controversial -- originally called \"October Rain,\" its overtly political lyrics had to be rewritten. Israel's songwriters rewrote it into a more metaphorical take, \"Hurricane.\" Protests are expected to continue on the ground in Sweden, though Palestinian flags will not be allowed into the arena where the singers compete.\n\nHost country Sweden is putting two of its finest up to the job: Petra Mede and Malin \u00c5kerman. Mede is a comedian who previously hosted for Sweden in 2013 and '16, and \u00c5kerman is an actor who you may know better as Juna from The Comeback or Tess from 27 Dresses. Mede will also perform during the final, as will 2023's Swedish winner, Loreen.\n\nEurovision may be organized by European broadcasters, but nowadays, it's pretty easy to watch across the pond too. That's thanks to Peacock, which is streaming both the semifinals and the final. It really has a monopoly on international competitions, doesn't it? (Or you could still always get a VPN and watch a proper European broadcast -- after all, they say nothing beats the real thing.) American viewers can even vote too, as part of the \"Rest of the World.\"\n\nKeep in mind that these are happening at night in Europe, though, which is the afternoon here. The second semifinal takes place May 9 at 3 p.m. ET, and the final is May 11 at 3 p.m. ET.

But the concert may be only the second-best attended event in the city that evening; a pro-Palestinian protest, calling for Israel's removal from the contest, is expecting at least 20,000 attendees, and possibly far more.\n\nThe competition - which tries desperately to retain its \"apolitical\" tag - has become the largest cultural event so far to be rocked by the repercussions of Israel's war in Gaza. Israel's military assault has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza since it was launched in response to Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Those protesting or boycotting the song contest claim it is \"artwashing\" the conflict; others defend Israel's inclusion, insisting the contest should not be dragged into geopolitics.\n\n\"Politics does influence the event from time to time,\" Paul Jordan, a fan and researcher of the contest who worked in its communications team from 2015 to 2018, told CNN. But this year, \"the presence of Israel has become such a big issue (that) I think it's going to overshadow the event,\" he said.\n\nWeeks of simmering tension over the question are coming to the fore in Malmo this week, ahead of the contest's semi-finals on Tuesday and Thursday. And they are leading to perhaps the tensest three minutes in the contest's history, when Israel's competitor, Eden Golan, performs live.\n\n\"We could well see protests in the arena, we could see booing,\" Jordan said. \"I would imagine the scale of it in Malmo would be bigger than anything we've ever seen before.\"\n\nIt is difficult to pierce the celebratory bubble that surrounds the competition each year. But even among Eurovision's media-managed contestants, there are some rumblings of discontent this time.\n\n\"It is frustrating. I don't agree with it at all. It doesn't make sense,\" Bambie Thug, Ireland's participant, told CNN of extensive rules restricting any form of pro-Palestinian statement during the event.\n\nThe singer previously released a statement resisting calls to boycott the event, saying they intended instead to provide a \"pro-Palestinian voice\" in Malmo. They told CNN that Israel's involvement in the competition was the \"wrong decision.\"\n\nFounded by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) in 1956 as a unity-fostering project between national broadcasters, Eurovision has been rocked and buffeted for decades by the continent's geopolitical currents. It offers an unrivaled soft power-building platform to member states with poor human rights records, like Azerbaijan and, until two years ago, Russia.\n\nBut this year is the most difficult yet for the EBU, which decided against excluding Israel over the country's war in Gaza, whereas Russia was barred after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago - contrasting stances that led to calls of double standards.\n\n\"The two are not comparative at all,\" the EBU's director general, Noel Curran, told CNN, insisting that Israel's national broadcaster KAN did not breach the contest's rules as Russia's did, which is the ultimate test of eligibility for the contest.\n\n\"If we start across the board just deciding that we're going to exclude people, on the basis of geopolitical situations or terrible things that might be happening in the world, then every year we're just going to have groups of people calling for someone to be excluded - be it Azerbaijan, be it somebody else,\" Curran said.\n\n\"We want to try and keep the contest as non-political as we can,\" he added. \"And that's hard.\"\n\nHe may be understating matters. Publicists representing a swathe of Europe's most eccentric musical artists in Malmo have been especially cautious with their talent, seeking to protect them from questions relating to the protests taking place just a few yards from their hotels.\n\nCNN asked to interview Golan, Israel's performer, for this story, but was told it would only be arranged if CNN provided the questions beforehand, which goes against standard journalistic practices.\n\nThe EBU was already forced to intervene when Golan's initial song submission, \"October Rain,\" was deemed to too closely reference Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel.\n\nAnd the EBU has worked hard to keep dissent from seeping into Malmo Arena. Long-standing rules preventing flags of non-competing countries and territories mean that Palestinian flags are banned from the crowd, which Bambie Thug told CNN they \"100%\" disagreed with.\n\nArtists are not allowed to make statements either, though some may risk the punishment - a fine for their broadcaster - to do so, as Iceland's act did in 2019, when they held up Palestinian flags during the contest, which was held in Israel.\n\n\"We wouldn't want them to do that, quite obviously,\" Curran said. \"That is not something that we want artists to do, and it's in the rules that they shouldn't do that, and can't do that.\"\n\nWhen asked by CNN, the EBU did not rule out adjusting sound levels on the broadcast to obscure booing, if it occurs during the Israeli performance.\n\nBut, for all their efforts, Eurovision bosses will hold their breaths while Golan sings in Saturday's grand final if, as expected, she progresses from Thursday's semi-final.\n\n\"The real worry would be any threat of violence, particularly towards the singers,\" Jordan said. \"The worst nightmare could be a stage invasion.\" The latter occurred during the United Kingdom's performance in 2018, when a man snatched the microphone from singer SuRie and screamed a message before being removed.\n\nAs Malmo sought to stage a week's worth of events and performances to celebrate Eurovision, it encountered a problem: artists kept dropping out, following pressure from pro-Palestinian groups urging a boycott of the contest.\n\n\"It has divided the city, in a way,\" admitted Karin Karlsson, who is in charge of staging the events in Malmo. \"I don't think we will solve any questions when it comes to the war in Gaza by boycotting,\" she said.\n\nIn total, she said 20 artists had dropped out of performing in the city. But Karlsson is undeterred. \"I sleep well,\" she said. \"I want to show everybody a vibrant, super diverse city, where we can live side by side but still think differently.\"\n\nShe hopes that Malmo is on track to fulfilling that goal. \"But you never know. It's uncertain at the moment.\"\n\nHer efforts may have been complicated by the choice of host. \"(Malmo) has this history of resistance and solidarity, and it's a working class city, but at the same time the municipality has tried to rebrand Malmo as a more global city,\" Elina Pahnke, a Malmo-based journalist covering culture for the Aftonbladet newspaper, told CNN. This has caused tensions with some residents, she explained.\n\nThe city is home to large Muslim and Palestinian populations. Weekly pro-Palestinian protests have been held since Israel's war in Gaza began in October, and the protest during Saturday's live final could be the biggest since those early weeks.\n\n\"We hope to show the EBU that the people of Malmo reject their attempt at artwashing,\" said Mohammad Ghannam, who has led the movement to boycott Eurovision as part of Sweden's Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) group.\n\nA massive security operation is in place; a Swedish police spokesperson told CNN it was one of the largest Malmo has ever seen, and involves officers from Denmark and Norway as well as Sweden.\n\nAnd last week, Israel's National Security Council raised its travel warning to Malmo, urging Israelis planning to attend Eurovision to reconsider whether they need to do so. It cited \"tangible concern that terrorists will exploit the protest and the anti-Israel atmosphere to carry out an attack on Israelis,\" and described Malmo as a hub for \"anti-Israel protests.\"\n\nLara Yosef, a 30-year-old Syrian migrant to Malmo who will be attending Saturday's demonstration, said that when she walks past Eurovision advertising in her city, \"I see blood.\"\n\n\"I'm hoping that some artists will surprise us and (make) some statements on stage,\" Yosef said.\n\nAmid those tensions, some artists have complained of online harassment and abuse, while others have praised the pro-Palestinian demonstrators. \"Power to them for protesting,\" Bambie Thug said, before their media manager quickly asked CNN to return to questions centered on their music.\n\nBut many more are working to block out what is becoming a near-deafening distraction, joining Eurovision's organizers in offering delicate comments. \"(Our) sympathy is (with) all people who say that war is sh*t,\" said Ukrainian contestant Alyona Alyona. \"Because who, if not we, can say what is war, and how sh*t it is?\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It was constant.\"\n\nEurovision fans don't realise that there is a week of dress rehearsals at the venue the week before the semi-finals and final. There are nine shows on the competition week, with three of them televised.\n\nThe other shows are for the juries to cast their votes and a family day.\n\nDavid said: \"You are in the arena five days prior to the semi-final and you are doing full rehearsals. Sometimes twice a day.\n\n\"For us, by the time the performance itself came around I could understand why some performers were tired, beat or wrecked. It is non-stop.\n\n\"You have to be mentally strong and look after yourself physically.\"\n\nHowever, David would do Eurovision again if the opportunity came along for him because it was an incredible time for him and the rest of Wild Youth.\n\nHe said: \"It was an amazing experience and I would love to do it again, to be honest.

Performers from 15 countries will go on stage in Malmo, Sweden, on Tuesday night, while a further 16 will sing their nation's chosen song on Thursday.\n\nEach semi-final will see 10 countries qualify and join hosts Sweden and the 'big five' nations of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK in Saturday night's final. While a jury has a say in the points awarded by each county in the grand final, the outcome is decided solely by viewers watching at home for the semi-finals.\n\nViewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 will be eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Viewers in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 will be eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain.\n\nREAD MORE: When and where Eurovision Song Contest 2024 is taking place\n\nThose watching in the participating countries can vote using the official Eurovision Song Contest app which can be downloaded for IOS and Android. There will also be voting by phone and SMS with the relevant numbers will be displayed on screen by each participating broadcaster.\n\nVoting will open after the last song has been performed, and will stay open for approximately 15 to 25 minutes. Those watching in any other eligible non-participating country can vote via a secure online platform www.esc.vote.\n\nThis will count towards the Rest Of The World vote and will open at around midnight the day before the semi-final - and close just before the live show starts.\n\nWhen voting ends the 10 songs with the most votes in each country will be allocated points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12 points. The audience in each participating country will award a total of 58 points (1 - 8, 10 and 12).\n\nThe Rest Of The World vote will also be allocated the same points and have the weight of one additional voting country. If a national audience vote cannot be recorded in a participating country for whatever reason, the points allocated from that country will be determined using an aggregated result.\n\nIf for some reason an aggregated result is not available, the national jury of the country concerned will allocate the points. Once all points have been allocated and added together, the 10 countries with the highest number of points will qualify for the final.\n\nHere is the running order for both semi-finals, listed by nation, artist, and song name.\n\nSemi-final 1, Tuesday, May 7\n\nCyprus./ Silia Kapsis - Liar Serbia.

A history of the Eurovision Song Contest", "body": "\"It's not everybody's cup of tea, but it is uniting in a way that few other things are,\" one expert said.\n\nKnown for its glitz, glamor and eccentricity, the Eurovision Song Contest will attract millions of viewers from across the globe when the grand final begins Saturday in Malm\u00f6, Sweden.\n\nBut a show that has become compulsory annual viewing for many has more humble beginnings as an attempt to heal the wounds of post-World War II Europe, while also achieving the technological marvel of beaming live television pictures into countries across the Continent.\n\n\"This was really an experiment in the nascent technology of television,\" historian Dean Vuletic told NBC News last month about the competition, which was first held in the picturesque Swiss city of Lugano in 1956 -- as TV sets first became a fixture in people's homes.\n\n\"We don't have the viewing figures for 1956, but TV ownership was not so widespread then so they were likely not very high,\" said Vuletic, who has written several books on Eurovision. But he said for broadcasters it was a test to see \"whether they could broadcast the same television show at the same time across Europe and live.\"\n\nModeled after Italy's famous Sanremo Music Festival, only seven nations took part. But among the neatly coiffed performers who were accompanied by a live orchestra were contestants from former axis powers West Germany and Italy.\n\nSince then, it has grown into a weeklong spectacle in which dozens of countries compete, including two -- Israel, which joined in 1973, and Australia, in 2015 -- who aren't even on the Continent.\n\n\"It's not everybody's cup of tea, but it is uniting in a way that few other things are,\" Amy Williamson, a teaching fellow in music at Britain's University of Southampton.\n\nLove it or hate it, there is no denying that the competition has provided a springboard for some of the world's best-known artists and songs.\n\nJust two years after its inception, Domenico Modugno's song \"Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu,\" also known as \"Volare,\" became a hit worldwide despite only placing third in the contest itself. It remains one of the most commercially successful non-English songs ever.\n\nABBA also went on to become a global phenomenon after they won the 1974 competition with their song \"Waterloo,\" and while Celine Dion had achieved moderate success in her home country of Canada, she gained international recognition after she won the 1988 competition representing Switzerland with her song \"Ne partez pas sans moi.\" It was a similar story for legendary balladeer Julio Iglesias after he represented Spain in 1970.\n\nHowever, it wasn't always smooth sailing for the competition, which was dogged by controversies about its voting system, the quality of music and the cost of hosting a contest that today runs into the tens of millions of dollars.\n\nSo over the years, changes have been made to rules and format of the contest. In 1999, the live orchestra was ditched allowing performers to use a backing track and, the same year, a rule change that allowed performers to sing in any language was also reintroduced. Prior to that, aside from a brief window in the 1970s, they were only allowed to sing in their country's official language.\n\nFive years later, semifinals were introduced. Held over two nights before the final, they allow more countries to compete.\n\nWhereas once the winners were selected by professional juries from each country, telephone voting has given the European public a say since 1997. They can now vote by phone or text message. Along with voters from the rest of the world, they can also use the contest's website and app.\n\nThe public vote and those from the juries are then converted into points and awarded to the most popular songs. The country with the most points wins.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and breakup of the former Yugoslavia that followed, a lot more nations began to compete, sharply increasing the cost of hosting the competition. So host countries began using larger arenas and seeking more commercial sponsorship for the event.\n\nThe entrants from the eastern bloc also started to make the contest \"more political,\" Vuletic, the historian, said, adding that \"this expansion of Eurovision is played out against the politics of European integration and the expansion of the European Union to Central and Eastern Europe.\"\n\nIn the early 2000s, he said nations like Estonia and Latvia used the contest as a \"tool in their cultural diplomacy,\" promoting their Western credentials and investing considerable resources into their entries.\n\nWhile the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs the contest, has historically positioned it as a nonpolitical event, \"politics is always very present in the background, not least in terms of the voting,\" said Christopher Wiley, a senior lecturer in music at the U.K.'s University of Surrey.\n\nIn the first contest in 1956, a Holocaust survivor represented West Germany, and both Greece and Turkey boycotted the contest after Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974. The EBU banned Russia from the contest in 2022 after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSome songs had \"been banned, or they have pulled out as a result of criticism,\" Williamson, of the University of Southampton, added. \"But in other years, when some of those points are more buried or metaphorical, they get away with it.\"\n\nSome are more explicit. Two years after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian singer Djamala won with a song about the mass deportation of the Peninsula's minority Muslim Tatar community under Stalin -- a song that was not censored by the EBU.\n\nFor the most part, the contest is known for its colorful and often campy performances, which Velutic said has led to it being long championed by the LGTBQ community. That helped to propel the Israeli transgender performer Dana International to a win in 1998 and the bearded Austrian drag queen Conchita Wurst in 2014. This year's contest features two nonbinary performers, Switzerland's Nemo and Ireland's Bambie Thug.\n\nThe contest \"really only came to embrace this popularity in the late 1990s when Europe came to really advance gay rights and pride itself on its advancement of the rights of sexual minorities,\" Velutic said.\n\nToday, he said it has almost turned into Europe's biggest election. \"In no other contest or no other event do you have so many people from so many countries in Europe being able to vote,\" he said.\n\nWilliamson also pointed out that, in some parts of the Continent, cultural traditions have sprung up around the contest, and it does dominate TV ratings in several countries. Nordic nations like Sweden, Finland and Norway all had viewing shares of above 80% for Eurovision last year, while in Iceland, it had 98.7% of the viewing share.\n\n\"It gets put on in pubs and in bars, people have Eurovision parties at home. Often people will get dressed up in crazy outfits to embrace the weirdness and the sort of over-the-topness of the whole event,\" Williamson said.\n\n\"There aren't many other things that unite people quite on that scale.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type":

We saw Ireland's contestant Bambie Thug breeze through and break Ireland's \"semi-final curse\" as well as Croatia's Baby Lasagne and also the popular Ukranian duo Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil.\n\nIreland's Bambie Thug, a cork-born singer managed to break through to the finals with their electro-metal song \"Doomsday Blue\". It's the first time Ireland has made the finals since 2018 and is now thought to be one of the favourites to win.\n\nCroatian singer Marko Purisic, aka Baby Lasagna, representing Croatia with his song 'Rim Tim Tagi Dim' is one of the favourites to win\n\nThe Ukranian duo Alyona and Heil have also been considered as a strong competition with their anthem \"Teresa & Maria\" as well as other favourite Croatia's contestant Baby Lasagne, who will perform his quirky \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\". Finland's Windows95Man with \"No Rules!\" also secured a place in the grand final.\n\nPop singer Olly Alexander, representing the UK with his hit song \"Dizzy\" has already been guaranteed a place in the finals. This is because the UK, along with France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, are known as the \"big five\". These countries are all guaranteed a place because of their status as one of the largest contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organisers behind Eurovision.\n\nSweden also got a free pass to the finals after being last year's winners. However, it wasn't good news for Australian fans as their act, Electric Fields, failed to qualify, as well as Moldova and Iceland. This came as a shock as Iceland's Hera Bj\u00f6rk and Moldova's Natalia Barbu were both former Eurovision contestants before.\n\nThere is a points system for scoring. Each country gets their chance to perform their song on stage. The winner is then decided by a points system which combines votes from the audience as well as the jury. After all the points from the jury have been awarded, they are displayed on the live scoreboard, and the combined number of points from both public votes are then revealed.\n\nMany people are confused by the points system, but by having two sets of points that are then combined makes it exciting as jury scores and public votes can wildly differ, leading to last minute points and unexpected champions.\n\nThere is a second round of semi-finals on Thursday May 9, with fifteen more countries hoping to secure one of the remaining top ten places. Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czechia, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway and the Netherlands. As well as Switzerland's contestant Nemo, who is another strong favourite with their operatic anthem \"The Code\".\n\nTop 10 who won last night's semi-finals: Serbia Portugal Slovenia Ukraine Lithuania Finland Cyprus Croatia Ireland Luxembourg\n\nThe countries who failed to make it to the finals were Moldova, Iceland, Australia, Poland and Azerbaijan.\n\nYou can watch all of the Eurovision finals action on BBC One and BBC iPlayer on Saturday May 11 at 8pm.\n\nDo you have a story to share?

It's the question on every fan's lips.\n\nThe man behind the stage design - Fredrik Stormby - who worked with Beyonce on her critically acclaimed Renaissance World Tour last year, is accustomed to keeping on-stage secrets under wraps.\n\n\"We'll see what happens,\" he tells Sky News. But it's worth noting that as well as working on Eurovision both this year and last, and with Queen Bey, he's also the lighting director for Abba Voyage.\n\nSo, if anyone's equipped to bring virtual avatars of the Swedish supergroup - dubbed \"Abbatars\" - to the Swedish city of Malmo, it's him.\n\nI suggest that if anything could turn talk away from the geopolitics overshadowing this year's show (there has been opposition to Israel taking part in the competition due to the ongoing ground offensive in Gaza) it would be Abba.\n\n\"Probably,\" he agrees with a poker face, then adds mystically: \"On the other hand, with Abba Voyage, the question is when you can close that circle, it might just go on forever into eternity.\"\n\nIt's 50 years since Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad won Eurovision, and while they've ruled out an in-person reunion at this Saturday's Eurovision Grand Final, the time would seem ripe for a virtual get together.\n\nThey've not played together since 1982 (on Noel Edmonds' long-forgotten The Late Late Breakfast Show), but Abba Voyage, the virtual show in East London has pulled in more than a million and a half punters since opening in 2022 and is rumoured to be set to tour globally.\n\nThe first Swedes to win Eurovision, it would be quite the coup to have them on the night - albeit through the magic of motion capture and light.\n\nBut while lips are firmly sealed on potential virtual appearances - leaving fans to watch and wait - what can we definitely expect from the Eurovision Grand Final?\n\nThe stage\n\nAt around 20 metres squared, and with a 360-degree viewing experience, it's a full-on event for both performers and spectators alike.\n\nThis year's show, which will be watched by around 200 million people worldwide, will feature massive video cubes centre stage, a moveable ceiling which can go up and down above the audience and, according to Stormby, \"lots of sand\".\n\nHe also promises plenty of colour and strong lines, in tune with the \"urban and young\" feel of Malmo and neighbouring Copenhagen.\n\nThe show's official theme is \"The Eurovision Lights,\" apparently inspired by combining the Northern Lights and the shape of a harmonic rhythm on sound equalizers. A fairly unique mash-up.\n\nSwift changes\n\nWith 26 acts to fit in across the final show (while it's a whacking four hours long, much of the second half is dedicated to the complex voting system), there are plenty of logistical demands on the designers.\n\nThe stage crews have around 45 seconds to change sets between acts, with the resulting speed of prop re-setting described by Stormby as \"a bit bonkers\".\n\nAnd it's not just the acts who are competing - everyone on the show's at it, according to Stormby.\n\n\"Everything with this production is a contest - it's all a competition. It doesn't really matter if you work in the production or if you are here as a delegation, because everything is really a fight against the clock to try to get it done... Of course, you want to win and have a great performance.\"\n\nWorking with last year's winner, Loreen\n\nStormby was part of the 2023 Swedish Eurovision delegation working with Loreen on the lighting for her winning entry Tattoo.\n\nHe thinks the staging - which Loreen and her team worked on creatively too - helped propel the performance to success, partly because it \"dared to stay in one lighting state\".\n\nHe adds: \"We didn't necessarily use all the effects [available to us] but took a bit more of a cinematic approach to it, which is quite uncommon in Eurovision. Maybe that's what made it stand out.\"\n\nSecurity\n\nSweden raised its terror threat level to \"high\" last year (four on a five-point scale), and Swedish police have warned that security will be tight around the event.\n\nStormby says that while security isn't part of his brief (it largely falls to the event organisers), he feels confident working in the arena.\n\nHe tells Sky News: \"I feel safe working here,\" adding: \"I've been to several early auditions and the security is always high. From my point of view, I'm glad they take anything they need to think about seriously. And I think it's where it needs to be, I guess, from the organiser's perspective.\"\n\nIn a slightly experimental approach, the show will aim to operate exclusively using LED and laser lights, to achieve lower constant power consumption.\n\nThe lighting design is made up of around 2000 light fixtures and 12 follow-spot systems.\n\nStormby says they hope to \"drive technology forward\" by using a greener approach as a \"guiding star\".\n\nMoments to look forward to\n\nStormby, who has sat through multiple rehearsals, gives a special shout-out to the plentiful \"mad Euro disco acts\" which he says have been inspired by last year's Finnish entry Cha Cha Cha by Kaarija, which came second in the competition.\n\nHe also promises that instead of raising the roof, he will be lowering it.\n\n\"There's a moment when we lower the ceiling over the audience, and it comes down really low and we start to work with the lights... I think the hardcore Eurovisioners will enjoy that, they are party people.\"\n\nAs for what he wants the audience to take away from the night, Stormy is clear: \"Just that they had a great show, and they got a little bit drunk and had a really good time and danced under the lights... And that they got the energy you want to get out of a show like this.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We (the team) have prepared for this for so long, and we are ready to give a great performance... the rest is not in our control.\"\n\nWith her energetic number, Loop, Bonnici aims to have viewers \"on the edge of their seats with excitement\" as she opens the second-semi final on Thursday night in Sweden's Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\nShe hopes to land one of the 10 spots in Saturday's final that are up for grabs among the 16 countries competing. Spain, France and Italy automatically qualify.\n\nThe last time Malta made it to the Eurovision final was in 2021 when Destiny Chukunyere sailed through the semi-final with her song Je Me Casse. Since then, both Emma Muscat and The Busker failed to make it through.\n\nAccording to the odds aggregator eurovisionworld, Bonnici is at the very bottom of the list of 37 countries competing in Eurovision. Bonnici has less than 1% chance of winning the competition, bookmakers say.\n\nThe Gozitan singer is undaunted, however, and has been buoyed by meeting the other contestants since she arrived in Malm\u00f6 last week and from taking part in two dress rehearsals.\n\n\"I have received a lot of positive feedback, especially after the rehearsals,\" she said.\n\n\"Following the second rehearsal, a 30-second snippet of my performance was aired and the reaction was amazing. I am looking forward and very prepared to hit the stage again on the night to open the show.\"\n\nIt's hard to not be impressed watching Bonnici embody her song title by looping through the air blindfolded, as she is supported by her dancers, who are also blindfolded. It's also hard to believe that she is a shy character.\n\n\"My parents used to call me the 'singer of the fireplace or the mirror' because I never wanted to sing in front of the public as I was so shy,\" she said. \"I was dancing by the age of three, but singing only at home, as I was too shy to be on stage or with a group of other singers or dancers.\"\n\nAt the age of 10, she began to attend a choir group and the teacher, Miriam Christine Borg, encouraged her to start singing on an individual level.\n\nAs she attended more solo singing lessons, her confidence grew, and by the age of nine she started to contest in small Gozitan singing festivals, often leaving as the winner.\n\nIn 2009, at the age of 11, she competed in the Malta Junior Eurovision Song Contest for the first time with 'The Mambo Song'. The following year, she had the opportunity to join Malta's representative, Nicole Azzopardi, at the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest, as a dancer.\n\nWhile Sarah is over 2,000km away from Malta, her fans are kept up-to-date through her social media channels.\n\nBut she doesn't find it easy.\n\n\"To be quite honest, I always struggled with social media, and I still do,\" she said.\n\nDescribing it as her \"biggest struggle\" Sarah said she makes a great effort to have a strong online presence, and it shows. As the countdown to the semi-finals creeps up, Sarah posts videos and stories on her Instagram every day and opens up to her fans about how she feels about her performance.\n\n\"It's not easy, I have to always be online, always post and be present, which stresses me out sometimes. And at the same time, I try not to read too much of the comments, as I believe certain people just write comments without thinking and I do not want to get influenced by certain hate comments.\n\n\"Unless comments are constructive, and I can learn from them, those are important to me.\"\n\nReflecting on her experience at the Malta Eurovision Song Contest, Sarah said it took her a while to accept that she won the national competition.\n\n\"I was never one of the favourites, I knew that. I would say I was one of the top five, but not the favourite one to win. But when the music video came out, people started to message me,\" she recalls\n\nShe believes she and her team offer something different to what previous contestants offered in previous years, and that her performance, full of lifts, stunts and singing, caught the attention of the public.\n\nGrowing up, Sarah recalls how she started to sing and dance from \"day one\", and it's easy to understand why once she began to describe her family.\n\n\"My mum can sing and play the guitar, my dad plays the piano, my uncle plays the guitar and sings, and another uncle plays the bass,\" she said.\n\n\"We are a super musical family,\" she says with a smile, recalling fond memories of her and her cousins putting together shows for the family to enjoy.\n\nShe recalls how all her family supported her journey to become a singer, even when she decided to quit her job as an accountant to take on singing full-time, but one person's role stood out from the rest.\n\n\"My grandma, she recently passed away, I think she was always my biggest inspiration, my number one fan and the person who pushed me the most,\" she recalled of her grandmother, Georgia Zammit, who died in March.\n\n\"I grew up with her, she raised me. I used to do everything with her, from sundried tomatoes, cooking, and visiting the elderly,\" she recalled. \"She was such a positive person. She always pushed me to never give up on my dream.\"\n\n\"I'm dedicating all this to her. The saddest thing about her passing is that she won't see me in Malm\u00f6, but she saw me perform in Malta. She was the first person I called when I won, and she was so happy.\"\n\nTen countries qualified from the first semi-final on Tuesday. They are Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland, Cyprus, Croatia, Ireland and Luxembourg.", "source": {"uri": "timesofmalta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofmalta.com"},

But I cannot, in good conscience, watch this year when the contest returns to Malmo, Sweden, on Saturday.\n\nLike thousands of others, I will be participating in the boycott over Israel's inclusion as its occupation forces in Gaza continue to gleefully take tens of thousands of innocent lives and reduce the territory's infrastructure to rubble.\n\nOrganisers and performers alike will tell you that the contest is about coming together.\n\nThis is not the time to \"come together for entertainment\", as the UK's entrant Olly Alexander (below) put it. I have no interest in coming together with apologists for the war crimes taking place in the occupied Palestinian territories; not while an imposed famine tears itself through the north of Gaza; not while mass graves are uncovered in bombed-out hospitals and streets.\n\nInstead, it is a time to stand in opposition to the violent and unjust ethnic cleansing of Palestine, carried out by a state that has been welcomed with open arms into the competition where other warmongering nations have been turned away. Alexander, like a handful of other contestants who have spoken out about the Israeli conflict, has been called on repeatedly to use their position of power to pressure the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) into banning Israel from the contest while its sabre rattling in the Middle East continues.\n\nBut rather than join the boycott, Alexander has instead centred his own feelings, prioritising his discomfort that protesters have shared, in his words, \"extreme\" comments in response to his decision to participate during a global boycott; comments such as those rightly pointing out that he has made himself complicit in genocide.\n\nGiven the chance, I would point out to Alexander that if he wanted to see what an \"extreme\" reaction to Israel's behaviour really looked like, he could look to the brutality and violence brought down upon student and academic protesters on university campuses across the US for standing against Israel's illegal conflict.\n\nStudents have thrown their bodies on to the front lines, and for that they have been beaten, pepper sprayed, smeared by false accusations of antisemitism on the world stage, and suspended. That is solidarity with the Palestinian people, and it has come with a dear cost to those willing to genuinely \"come together\".\n\nREAD MORE: Inside the Gaza encampment at Edinburgh University\n\nBut no, truly, Alexander's feelings being hurt is what matters right now. Being able to participate in a song contest while making vague concessions to the righteousness of the boycott movement is as good as you can expect.\n\nSpeaking on The Late Late Show on RTE One, Ireland's Bambie Thug went as far as saying that if she wasn't participating in the contest, she would probably be taking part in the boycott. Which to me, is the epitome of the problem. Celebrities who say the right things but go no further, who will advocate for a boycott or a cause - until the moment it inconveniences them personally.\n\nIsrael intends to use the Eurovision Song Contest to artwash its horrific crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories. While other countries have been disqualified for failing to meet the EBU's guidelines on \"neutrality\", Israel was instead given multiple chances to rewrite the lyrics to its entry after they appeared to reference the October 7 attack by Hamas. Eden Golan's songs, titled October Rain and Dance Forever, were both rejected by the EBU for being political in nature, before eventually being rewritten into Hurricane, which was approved.\n\nIsrael's public broadcaster refused to change the lyrics until the nation's president, Isaac Herzog (below), stepped in and demanded they be rewritten to secure entry into the competition.\n\nThe broadcaster stated that the president had made clear that \"when those who hate us seek to push aside and boycott the state of Israel from every stage, Israel must sound its voice with pride and its head high and raise its flag in every world forum\". Israel's participation in Eurovision is, unequivocally, a political act.\n\nIt feels almost surreal to argue that the position of welcoming a genocide propagandist onto the stage of an international cultural event is, somehow, apolitical in nature. We're all very aware by now of how advocating for the status quo is seen to be a neutral proposition while critics are branded as agitators.\n\nBut obviously, the act of maintaining an unjust system or decision is just as political as the decision to oppose and tear it down, or to set militarised police on students, or pretend that intentionally starving a civilian population of food and water is not a breach of international humanitarian law when it patently, obviously, is.\n\nI won't centre the feelings of those participating in Eurovision over the needs of the boycott movement - not while it has already been so successful in prompting divestment and change in educational institutions and corporate entities.\n\nMcDonald's has been pressed into buying back all of its Israeli restaurants after franchisees gave thousands of free meals away to the murderous occupation forces. Starbucks profits have taken a significant hit.\n\nAnd universities have rightly begun to divest from Israel in response to student-led protest movements on campuses that have prompted such violence from police in the US government as to almost surely secure their legacy; wherein peace demonstrators will be brutally suppressed today, only to be lauded and celebrated tomorrow by the same people who cheered at every bloody swing of the baton.\n\nWords mean nothing without the will to take action. And while boycotting Eurovision is a small act indeed, it remains to me a necessary one. I hope, reader, you will join me in doing so - and that you won't forget those who put their desire to perform above their desire to do right.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType":

Security was high at Malm\u00f6 Arena - where Sweden's terror threat level and a row over Israel's participation in the contest have been a challenge for organisers - but the evening unfolded without much ado.\n\nThe biggest headlines were grabbed by Swedish artist Eric Saade, who performed as the opening act, wearing a Palestine keffiyeh, a scarf, wrapped around his wrist. Saade's mother is Swedish and his father is a Palestinian who was born and raised in Lebanon. Saade has been critical of the European Broadcasting Union's decision to allow Israel to compete despite its involvement in the brutal war in Gaza.\n\nBoth Swedish public broadcaster SVT and the EBU criticised Saade for wearing the scarf.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show. All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event,\" said EBU in a statement.\n\n\"I got that scarf from my dad as a little boy, to never forget where the family comes from. I didn't know then that it one day would be called a 'political symbol'. That's like calling the Dala horse a political symbol. To my eyes, it's nothing but racism. I just wanted to be inclusive and carry something that's real to me - but EBU seems to think that my ethnicity is controversial. That says nothing about me, but everything about them. I repeat this year's Eurovision Song Contest slogan: United by music,\" Saade responded in a text message to SVT.\n\nSwedish vocabulary: a wrist - en handled\n\nWill Sweden's central bank cut interest rates today?\n\nThe Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, is set to make a widely awaited announcement on the country's so-called policy rate at 9.30am on Wednesday. Many are hoping that it will cut the rate for the first time in eight years, but it's possible they will postpone the cut another month.\n\nThe policy rate currently stands at 4.0 percent, the highest interest rate seen in Sweden since 2008.\n\nThis is a crucial announcement, as the policy rate is the bank's main monetary policy tool. It decides which rates Swedish banks can deposit in and borrow money from the Riksbank, which in turn affects the banks' own interest rates on savings, loans and mortgages.\n\nIf bank interest rates are high, it's expensive to borrow money, which means people spend less and as a result inflation drops.\n\nBut now that inflation is on its way down, Riksbank chiefs themselves have said that they think it's likely that they will cut the policy rate in either May or June, and several economists predict that the cut is going to come sooner rather than later, which would mean today.\n\nThe Local will cover the interest rate announcement when it comes.\n\nSwedish vocabulary: an interest rate - en r\u00e4nta\n\n11 foreign soldiers injured in Nato exercise in Sweden\n\nEleven soldiers were injured while jumping from parachutes during a Nato exercise in Sm\u00e5land, south-eastern Sweden.\n\nThe soldiers are from the US, Hungary and Italy, reports the Aftonbladet tabloid, and were taken to hospital in Link\u00f6ping and J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping.\n\n\"We're talking wounds and fractures, no one has life-threatening injuries,\" an Army spokesperson confirmed to Aftonbladet.\n\nBetween 600 and 800 Nato troops carried out parachute jumps on Tuesday.\n\nHope you enjoyed the summer while it lasted, because on Wednesday snow was again set to fall in central Sweden.\n\nWeather agency SMHI warned people living in areas where it snowed overnight, particularly in some parts of V\u00e4sternorrland and northern J\u00e4mtland, to drive slowly and carefully as they and most other people will probably already have switched to summer tyres by now.\n\nEven Stockholm may get some flakes of snow, but it's not clear how much will actually stick.\n\nMay snowfall is unusual but not unique, an SMHI spokesperson told the TT newswire.\n\nThe southern G\u00f6taland region will get to enjoy summer temperatures on Wednesday, and the mercury is expected to climb back into double-digits in the rest of the country as well on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "thelocal.se", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Local"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_l@thelocal.se", "name": "Emma L", "type": "author",

With protests expected to accompany the event, tensions are running high, prompting security concerns in the host city of Malm\u00f6.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Israel's entry into the competition has courted controversy of its own. Initially titled 'October Rain' and perceived to contain references to recent conflicts, the song was barred from performance due to breaches of political neutrality. However, following pressure from Israeli authorities and the zionist lobby, adjustments were made, allowing Israel to compete under the revised title 'Hurricane'.\n\nCalls for a boycott of the competition have echoed across various countries, with artists and industry professionals voicing their opposition to Israel's participation.\n\nLeading up to the 2024 edition, numerous voices have advocated for a boycott of the competition from various nations. Notable among these calls, over 1,000 Swedish artists including Robyn, Fever Ray, and First Aid Kit, have urged for Israel's exclusion from this year's event. Similarly, more than 1,400 Finnish music industry professionals have lent their support to a petition seeking to bar Israel from participating in the contest. Additionally, individual artists like Olly Alexander, representing the UK in this year's competition, have faced pressure to boycott the event. Alexander, who initially signed a statement in December denouncing Israel as an \"apartheid state\" and accusing it of genocide, underscores the depth of sentiment surrounding the issue.\n\nDespite these calls, some performers have chosen to participate, viewing the contest as an opportunity to advocate for peace and unity.\n\nIn response to mounting tensions, the EBU has issued a warning against harassing Eurovision entrants over the Israel-Palestine issue. While acknowledging the sensitivity of the matter, the EBU reaffirmed its commitment to freedom of speech while condemning any form of online abuse directed at participants.\n\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the EBU swiftly took action, preventing the country from participating in future editions of the iconic contest. EBU has refused to ban Isreal despite public outcry and severity of Isreal's crimes clearly exceeding that of Russia.\n\nAs the Eurovision Song Contest approaches, it remains to be seen how the contentious issue of Israel's participation will unfold.

The UK\u2019s biggest pizza chain sells as many as 31 pizzas a second during an England match, and it wants to keep up its average delivery time of 24 minutes. The bloke stretching dough behind the counter at the Golders Green branch in North London appears in good shape for the challenge. Addicted to work: Domino\u2019s chief executive Andrew Rennie on his undercover mission working as a chef at one of his outlets With grey hair and a sportsman\u2019s freckled skin, he\u2019s a bit older than the average chef at the chain. But, dressed in a Domino\u2019s chef\u2019s outfit from head to toe and wearing Nike trainers, Andrew Rennie certainly looks the part. He happily takes an order from a builder who\u2019s strolled in off the street. No-one would guess that it\u2019s his first time in this branch of Domino\u2019s \u2013 or indeed that he is the boss of the \u00a31.3billion company, with more than 1,300 outlets across the UK and Ireland.

Share this article Share HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP How to choose the best (and cheapest) stocks and shares Isa \u2018Football and pizza just go so well together,\u2019 grins the modest chief executive. He is not sporting his usual expensive watch, but says he does wears his pizza-making uniform most days. He doesn\u2019t own a car but loves his Kawasaki motorbike, though he won\u2019t be trying deliveries on it. He says: \u2018This is our busiest time of year and we\u2019ve got to get it right.\u2019 Andrew Rennie's five tips for the top Domino\u2019s hung on to its marketing budget at the start of the year so it could embark on a splurge this summer. It\u2019s also relaunching its \u2018ultimate spicy sausage\u2019 pizza, which was hugely popular during the last World Cup. Investors hope this tournament will help Domino\u2019s shares rebound. At \u00a33.19, they are a long way off their high of \u00a34.59 in 2021. In Rennie, who took over as FTSE 250-listed Domino\u2019s UK & Ireland boss in August, it has an experienced pair of hands. He has spent more than 20 years aggressively growing this pizza empire worldwide, including running the European business from 2014 to 2020. Now the 56-year-old is raring to get more Pepperoni Passions and Twisted Dough Balls into Britons\u2019 bellies. The firm accounts for more than three quarters of branded pizza sales in the UK, he says, but adds: \u2018We\u2019ve got over 1,330 stores across the UK and Ireland, but I want to get us to 2,000 by 2032.\u2019 It\u2019s a long way from the single British branch in Luton in 1985, when the North American franchise first expanded overseas. He\u2019s moving into smaller towns and villages, now cities are saturated. But is there antipathy to a brash Domino\u2019s landing in the shires? \u2018If they don\u2019t like us, they\u2019re not doing a very good job of showing it \u2013 they\u2019re buying an awful lot of pizza. A lot of those villages have very few brands so we\u2019ve become quite the place to go.\u2019 He too grew up in a part of Wagga Wagga in New South Wales with a population of just 6,000. Rennie enlisted in the army at 15. After a decade in fatigues, he decided to open a Domino\u2019s - then a fairly small pizza franchise in Australia \u2013 in his tiny hometown. \u2018Head office pointed out the average store had a 50,000 population around it, and mine had 10 per cent of that, and would fail. But I got it open and became obsessed with service. If a pizza was late, or we made a mistake, I\u2019d go to people\u2019s houses, offer them free pizza, free Coke, beg them to return. I knew 350 of my customers\u2019 names and addresses off by heart, and I\u2019d personally handle their pizza.\u2019 Furrowing his brow, apparently still upset by it, Rennie reels off the address and concerns of a Mr Grey, who 30 years ago complained of a stingy amount of jalapeno on his pizza. To say this chief executive is obsessed with customer service is an understatement. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t sleep if I lost a customer. I was so driven that from our tiny store, smaller than most home kitchens, we became the number one store in Australia.\u2019 He then built a 30-strong Domino\u2019s franchise over a decade, before being approached to sell up in exchange for a shareholding in Domino\u2019s Australia business. When it listed in Sydney and the company bought out the Domino\u2019s franchise for France, Belgium and the Netherlands, Rennie moved to Paris. \u2018I was the only one who could count to ten in French, so I was sent to run France in 2006.; Over five years, the father-of-three tripled the size of the French business. Shift: Domino's is moving into smaller towns and villages, now cities are saturated After three years back Down Under running Domino\u2019s in Australia and New Zealand, Rennie returned to the Continent to run the European division, growing Domino\u2019s in Germany to 1,200 branches. Four years ago, he retired \u2013 having made enough to never work again \u2013 to live on his farm in Australia. He was 52 and his \u2018retirement\u2019 was short lived. It never involved any leisure, as in that time Rennie set up 25 businesses, including a cheesecake maker, car wash, whisky distillery and cattle farm, but even that wasn\u2019t enough. When his ex-wife moved to London with their youngest son, he moved to England too. He says: \u2018Then Domino\u2019s Pizza Group came knocking on the door and I couldn\u2019t not come out of retirement.\u2019 Now Rennie\u2019s laser-sharp focus is directed at UK and Irish growth. Top of his list is a Domino\u2019s loyalty scheme: \u2018We\u2019ve 30 million active customers in our database, who buy on average 4.3 times a year. My wish is to get them to five.\u2019 Andrew Rennie, 56 PIZZA ORDER: Jalapeno, pepperoni and pineapple Lives: Marylebone, central London FIRST JOB: Mowing lawns on an Australian farm FAMILY: Met second wife at an ACDC concert. Three children aged 25 to 13. FITNESS: Rows 5km, runs 3km and lifts weights before work: \u2018The harder I train, the more I can eat.\u2019 PAY: \u00a3775,000 a year plus bonus of up to 150 per cent of salary. More ambitiously, he\u2019s scrawled a secretive shopping list, looking to snap up a smaller rival: \u2018A brand with 50 or 80 outlets, with all the start-up mistakes already done.\u2019 He is looking for a brand Britons want to munch on in the daytime, as 90 per cent of Domino\u2019s pizzas are scoffed in the evenings. The chief executive is always thinking of the future. He talks of drones and driverless deliveries being \u2018five or so years away\u2019, conceding: \u2018The rarest asset on earth now is human beings, people to deliver the products. For now, we\u2019re focused on electric bicycles: better for the environment, and much faster for our customers.\u2019 There\u2019s a pause as Rennie\u2019s latest creation emerges from the oven. He has sandwiched some chocolate chip cookies, butter and cinnamon into pizza dough to create a new dessert. I was sceptical, but demolished it then licked the box clean. Will Domino\u2019s be delivering this to any party as a pre-election boost? \u2018This business is nearly 40 years old and has done well whoever\u2019s in charge,\u2019 the Aussie replies. \u2018I\u2019ve been through elections in France, Australia, Germany. We just say vote for pizza.\u2019 With that, Rennie takes me behind the counter to teach me the secrets behind the perfect Domino\u2019s pizza. It\u2019s harder than it looks. I\u2019m gently told my effort would not pass muster \u2013 dodgy crust,. As I leave, Rennie is pinching out another ball of dough. He says with a shrug: \u2018Unfortunately, I\u2019m addicted to work. But I\u2019m fortunate in that I can be here because I want to.\u2019 And with that, Rennie grabs another handful of pepperoni and gets back to his pizza.

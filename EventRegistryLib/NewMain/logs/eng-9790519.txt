Celebrating her 32nd birthday -- which was 2 August -- Charli came dressed to party.\n\nThe Brat singer wore dark grey microshorts (which have quickly become this year's biggest trend) along with a white cut-out t-shirt, tall black boots, sunglasses, and a black handbag. In true millennial form, she accessorised the outfit with a studded bracelet that's reminiscent of the early Noughties.\n\nIn a video taken at the party, Charli and Lorde can be seen standing on an elevated surface and dancing together. Both musicians were dramatically singing the lyrics of Girl, so confusing remix to each other and laughing in between while the crowd recorded them and sang along.\n\nCharli XCX brought Lorde onto the remixed version after fans speculated that the vulnerable, tense hit was about fellow pop star Lorde. It turns out, they were right, and Lorde hopped on the track to give her side of the story that details a complex friendship between the two. The original version centres around Charli not knowing where she stands with Lorde -- \"Yeah, I don't know if you like me / Sometimes I think you might hate me / Sometimes I think I might hate you / Maybe you just wanna be me.\"\n\nIn the remix, Lorde responds with a vulnerable verse that shares her struggle with body image and how \"awesome\" Charli's life looked to her. \"I never thought for a second / My voice was in your head,\" Lorde sings.\n\nAfter releasing such a vulnerable song, seeing the two musicians having fun together and singing it proudly was a major moment. Charli and Lorde hugged at the end of the song, proving that they truly did work it out on the remix.\n\nCharli XCX's birthday party had a long list of A-list attendees including Glen Powell, Anya Taylor-Joy, Rosal\u00eda, Alexa Demie, Addison Rae, Lukas Gage, and more.", "source": {"uri": "glamourmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glamour UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@glamourmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lorde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charli XCX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosal\u00eda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rosal\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Rae", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addison Rae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Demie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexa Demie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anya_Taylor-Joy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anya Taylor-Joy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body image"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/66b09c948f142695283e5a28/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/CHARLIE%20XCX%20LORDE%20050824%20defaultGettyImages-1344182041.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790519", "eventUri": "eng-9790519", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 229, "textEnd": 237}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Celebrating her 32nd birthday -- which was August 2 -- Charli came dressed to party. The Brat singer wore dark gray micro-shorts (which have quickly become this year's biggest trend) along with a white cut-out t-shirt, tall black boots, sunglasses, and a black handbag. In true millennial form, she accessorized the outfit with a studded bracelet that's reminiscent of the early aughts.\n\nIn a video taken at the party, Charli and Lorde can be seen standing on an elevated surface and dancing together. Both musicians were dramatically singing the lyrics of \"Girl, so confusing\" remix to each other and laughing in between while the crowd recorded them and sang along.\n\nCharli XCX brought Lorde onto the remixed version after fans speculated that the vulnerable, tense hit was about fellow pop star Lorde. It turns out, they were right, and Lorde hopped on the track to give her side of the story that details a complex friendship between the two. The original version centers around Charli not knowing where she stands with Lorde -- \"Yeah, I don't know if you like me / Sometimes I think you might hate me / Sometimes I think I might hate you / Maybe you just wanna be me.\"\n\nIn the remix, Lorde responds with a vulnerable verse that shares her struggle with body image and how \"awesome\" Charli's life looked to her. \"I never thought for a second / My voice was in your head,\" Lorde sings.", "source": {"uri": "teenvogue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Teen Vogue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashleigh_carter@teenvogue.com", "name": "Ashleigh Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lorde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charli XCX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_(album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charli (album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body image"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/66afb3efec4ad3e14969cc31/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Untitled%20design%20(30).png?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790519", "eventUri": "eng-9790519", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 231, "textEnd": 239}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Even Alexa Demie came out of hibernation, blowing gum at the paps while dressed in a Little Tokyo Table Tennis jersey, bicycle shorts and boots.\n\nCharli dueted with Lorde; Charli dueted with Billie; and Charli dueted with what is perhaps the world's ugliest cake, a disintegrating mound of icing and dough festooned in sloping candles. But such is the Brat MO: to rehabilitate the messy and the sloppy as signs of a life well-lived. Timony Ramos's unfocused and artfully grease-lensed photographs from the evening will prove just how aspirational this undone lifestyle - described by Charli herself as \"a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter

In true Charli style, the club night bash was utterly Brat-coded, with the singer marking the occasion in a head-to-toe look by emerging designer Sia Arnika.\n\nYou may also like\n\nThe set, which hailed from the Berlin-based, Danish-born brand, included a cut-out white top, charcoal wraparound micro shorts and a pair of black knee high shark boots - a Charli signature.\n\nWith a helping hand from her ever-innovative stylist Chris Horan, she accessorised with a black leather shoulder back and her go-to rave shades also sourced from the independent label. A coordinating studded leather bracelet injected a punkish attitude into the look.\n\nThe star was joined by a swathe of industry acquaintances for the Brattish bonanza hosted in the modish Silverlake neighbourhood of LA. Billie Eilish, who recently joined forces with Charli to release a new remix of the It-Brit's track Guess, attended in an oversized baseball tee and an apple green bandana (highly fitting considering Charli's Apple dance has gripped Gen Z like no other post-millennial trend.)\n\nThe two performed a live rendition of their headline-hitting collaboration which took the internet by storm. During the music video for the deliciously provocative tune, the pair can be seen scaling a mountain of lingerie as American star Billie drives a bulldozer. The singers subsequently donated all of the unworn garments to the charity I Support The Girls.\n\nBillie's brother Finneas was also spotted in attendance at the 'do, in addition to the Haim sisters, Este, Danielle and Alana, Addison Rae, Tove Lo, Gracie Abrams, Glen Powell, Anya Taylor-Joy, Lorde and Rosalia.\n\nThe latter's gift to Charli didn't go unnoticed. The singer and partner of The Bear actor Jeremy Allen White gifted the birthday girl perhaps the Brattiest present of all - a bouquet of deep purple Calla Lilies, peppered with cigarettes.", "source":

Ali then allegedly swerved into the sidewalk and tried to hit three men -- a 41-year-old, 44-year-old, and 18-year-old -- outside the school building.\n\nIn video of the incident posted online by Flatbush Shomrim, the attacker appears to chase the men -- driving over the sidewalk, onto the school's lawn, and across the paved pathway to the front door as one of the victims runs to the side of the building. According to the New York Post, Ali also threatened a large group of students on the other side of the building.\n\nNo injuries were reported as a result of the incident, according to the NYPD. After an initial investigation, Ali was arrested on Wednesday afternoon and hit with a dozen charges, including attempted murder as a hate crime, attempted assault as a hate crime, reckless driving, and reckless endangerment. The top charge, attempted murder, carries with it a prison sentence of up to 25 years if convicted.\n\nOn social media, Gov. Kathy Hochul said New York State Police were \"closely coordinating\" with the NYPD in the ongoing investigation of the incident.\n\n\"We are thankful that this individual is in police custody,\" Hochul wrote. \"Hate crimes have no place in New York and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\"\n\nAntisemitic hate crimes have been on the rise in New York City since last fall, after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. As of April 30, a total of 111 antisemitic incidents had been reported, according to the NYPD, up nearly 50% from 75 incidents during the same period last year.\n\nIn Brooklyn, those attacks have included the vandalism of two menorahs in Sunset Park, the attempted arson of a restaurant in Williamsburg, and an antisemitic symbol left outside a Midwood home. Earlier this month, two young boys -- both wearing yarmulkes -- were attacked while playing outside their home in Bed-Stuy.\n\nOverall hate crimes are up 200% in the 63rd Precinct, where Wednesday's incident occurred, with three incidents reported as of May 26 compared to just one last year, though the details on the victims of those attacks are not yet available.", "source": {"uri":

Kathy Hochul.\n\nVideo posted by the Flatbush Shomrim, a Jewish neighborhood watch group, showed the white sedan jumping a curb and driving onto a dirt yard toward several Orthodox Jewish men, who scrambled out of the way. A second clip in the video showed the vehicle screeching to a halt next to several Jewish men on a sidewalk.\n\nFlatbush Shomrim said in an accompanying social media post that the man had shouted antisemitic slurs during the attack.\n\nAn NYPD spokesperson told the New York Jewish Week that the suspect's name is Asghar Ali and he was charged with more than 10 crimes, including attempted murder as a hate crime.\n\nHochul said the New York State police were coordinating with the NYPD to investigate the incident.\n\n\"Hate crimes have no place in New York and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,\" she said in a post on X.\n\nAdams said the suspect appeared \"to have been emotionally disturbed\" and was quickly arrested, and that the incident was being investigated as a possible hate crime.\n\n\"There's no room for hate in the city, and the police department is going to respond accordingly,\" the mayor said in a interview with the 92.3 FM radio station.\n\nThe UJA-Federation of New York thanked the NYPD and district attorney's office for their handling of the incident.\n\n\"All steps must be taken to preserve the safety and well-being of our community,\" the federation said on X.\n\nThere have been at least 285 antisemitic incidents reported to police since the start of October, far higher than the 153 incidents during the same period last year, according to preliminary police data. Jewish security groups say many attacks likely go unreported.\n\nBoth before Oct. 7 and since, Jews have consistently been targeted in more hate crimes than any other group in New York City. Between the start of October and the end of March, Jews were the victims of 62% of all hate crimes, according to NYPD data.\n\nRecent years have seen waves of street harassment and attacks against Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn. According to the ADL's audit of antisemitic incidents last year, \"visibly Orthodox\" Jews were targeted in 31 out of the 51 antisemitic assaults the group recorded in New York City.\n\nIn a separate case, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced a hate crimes indictment against Skiboky Stora, 40, for attacks on Jews and others.\n\nIn November, according to the indictment, a Jewish couple was walking its dogs in Union Square in downtown Manhattan when they witnessed Stora tearing down posters of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The couple took a photo of Stora, who then followed them while shouting antisemitic remarks, including \"Die, Jews, Die!\"\n\nIn addition, since October, Bragg's office said, Stora has harassed or assaulted several non-Jewish people while making discriminatory remarks. Stora was charged with assault in the third degree as a hate crime, stalking in the third degree as a hate crime and aggravated harassment, Bragg's office said in a statement.", "source": {"uri":

Cab Driver Attempts to Run Down Students at Jewish School", "body": "A Pakistani cab driver drove past a Jewish school, shouting anti-Semitic things before he drove onto the curb and attempted to run people down. This happened yesterday in Brooklyn.\n\n\"Somebody came in, running in that a car came onto the sidewalk and almost killed him, almost knocked him down. The guy fell, tripped while running,\" a student told CBS New York.\n\nA teacher frantically ran inside the school and told people to call 911 as students were getting ready for class. Students said the driver turned around and went by a second time...\n\nWitnesses said the driver shouted antisemitic statements as he circled the property. He nearly struck three students and two rabbis, yeshiva officials said.\n\n\"It was very scary statements, killing statements,\" the student said.\n\nThe driver was identified as 58-year-old Asghar Ali. He was arrested shortly after the attack. What did he yell?\n\nA Brooklyn man was charged with a long list of crimes Wednesday after allegedly saying \"I will kill all the Jews\" and trying to mow down a group of Orthodox men with his car, according to police...\n\nAli was charged with attempted murder as a hate crime and roughly a dozen other offenses, including menacing, vehicular assault, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. Police said he lives in Midwood.\n\nHere's the video of what happened.\n\nAli apparently has a long history of mental issues and has been hospitalized several times.\n\nAli, who migrated to the US from Pakistan more than 20 years, has a history of disturbing behavior dating to 2007, law enforcement sources told The Post.\n\nOn June 7, 2007, he was taken to the hospital for evaluation after an incident on Coney Island Avenue.\n\nNo details were immediately available in that incident, but on Aug. 30, 2011, the sources said Ali was taken into custody by cops for acting irrationally and threatening to harm himself...\n\nThen, on Jan. 21, 2023, the sources said Ali was taken to Coney Island Hospital after he was spotted walking around in circles on Flatbush Avenue and Kings Highway looking confused.\n\nClearly he has problems but then so did Jared Lee Loughner, the deranged man who shot a bunch of people in Tuscon including Rep. Gabby Giffords back in 2011. The fact that he was a nut didn't stop progressives from collectively deciding that Sarah Palin and the right's tone was probably responsible.\n\nIn fact, this is exactly the sort of thing that would prompt a public discussion about a climate of hate if only the hate in question could be pinned on the right. The general idea is that there are deranged people out there who are absorbing the vibes they pick up from the news. And while responsible adults may be able to discern that not all political speech is meant to be taken literally, we have to worry about those who are too marginal to know the difference.\n\nAll of which would seem to apply in this case. What gave Ashgar Ali the idea to attack a group of Jews in Brooklyn? What aspects of our current political climate might have inspired this hate crime? And it's worth noting this is far from the only such case in New York. Anti-Semitic hate crimes are up and today two different activist groups held a rally to demand public safety.\n\nTwo advocate groups -- EndJewHatred and TakeBackNYC -- rallied in front of City Hall amid the rise of antisemitic hate crimes in the city since Oct. 7. That date marked the start of the conflict between Israel and Hamas...\n\nIn 2024 alone, over 150 antisemitic hate crimes have been reported to the NYPD, 60% more than were reported during the same time period last year.\n\nAll the elements to blame this on a climate of hate are there but as it stands I don't think we'll be hearing anyone in the media asking aloud what might have inspired this. All of the likely answers look bad for their team. This is a media game that only gets played when the right can be blamed and put on the defensive.\n\nIt should go without saying that no one should be told to silence their views because some nut might get the wrong idea and do something violent. Unless a person is explicitly calling for violence, the behavior of a deranged third party is not the fault of a anyone else. In this case, it's not the fault of campus protesters or leftist commentators on X that this particular man with mental problems tried to kill a group of Jewish people yesterday.\n\nIt's amazing how quickly many on the left forget how that works the moment there's a chance to blame their opponents for some bad behavior. That's when we start hearing speculation about how the climate of hate may have played a role. But again, we won't be hearing any of that this time.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_sexton@hotair.com", "name": "John Sexton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yeshiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCBS-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WCBS-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orthodox Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Giffords", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Giffords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Highway_(Brooklyn)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kings Highway (Brooklyn)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coney Island Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island_Avenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coney Island Avenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Lee_Loughner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Lee Loughner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwood,_Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwood, Brooklyn"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatbush_Avenue", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flatbush Avenue"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Palin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/203/ae69c2d3-5fca-4252-94c0-aa0deda33236.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9610842", "eventUri": "eng-9610842", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-06-07", "textStart": 1581, "textEnd": 1593}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-08-30", "textStart": 1745, "textEnd": 1758}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 3352, "textEnd": 3358}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

He was later charged with attempted murder as a hate crime.\n\nResponding to an article from local news outlet Pix11 about the incident, James wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday: \"This is horrific.\"\n\n\"In New York, no one should ever fear for their lives because of who they are. We must make sure that Jews and every New Yorker feels safe here,\" she continued. \"Anyone who commits an act of hate and antisemitism must be held fully accountable.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to James' office via email for comment.\n\nJames' warning echoed the remarks of New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who wrote on X, Wednesday: \"Hate crimes have no place in New York and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\"\n\nFrom January to the end of March of this year, there have been 136 confirmed incidents and 46 arrests relating to hate crimes, according to the NYPD Hate Crimes Dashboard. Of these incidents, 81, well over half, were antisemitic. Of the total, 11 incidents were against Black people, 11 against gay males and 6 against Muslims.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said at an event celebrating Jewish heritage on Wednesday that pro-Palestinian protests in the city about the Israel-Hamas war are signs of growing radicalization among younger generations, tying the protests to a 2023 Gallup poll that found a low percent of young Americans are proud about their national identity.\n\n\"When you add that lack of percentage with the fact that, right on our college campuses, we're radicalizing our children not only to hate Jewish people but to hate the country that they're educated in the first place,\" Adams said. \"Something is wrong with that.\"\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll conducted from June 1 to 22, 2023, only 18 percent of U.S. adults aged 18 to 34 years old, said they are extremely proud to be American. A total of 1,013 U.S. adults were surveyed and the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests have erupted across the country, especially on college campuses, as the Israel-Hamas war rages on. During Hamas' surprise attack on Israel in on October 7, 2023, about 1,200 people were killed and some 250 were taken hostage. Israeli officials say that around 100 hostages remain in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\nAt least 36,096 Palestinians have been killed so far in Israel's retaliatory military operation in Gaza, according to local health officials. Israeli officials say it has killed 15,000 militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the war will not end until Hamas is eliminated.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors":

Nervous.\"\n\nInvestigators said that the driver of the car, Asghar Ali, 58, tried to run over the students and rabbis after yelling disturbing comments, which witnesses heard, according to first responders.\n\n\"What they're saying,\" said Steven Weill, a coordinator of Shomrim Safety Patrol, quoting eyewitnesses, \"[is that Ali} said that he wants to kill all the Jews.\"\n\nAs the attack was happening, students saw and memorized the car's license plate number. They gave the information to the Shomrim Safety Patrol, which, in turn, notified police and tracked the car down about a mile from where the crime took place.\n\nWeill, the Shomrim coordinator, encountered Ali when police arrested him.\n\n\"I considered him mentally disturbed the second he pulled up on the sidewalk,\" said Weill. \"What motivated him, I don't know. That's up to police hate crimes [investigators] to do their investigation.\"\n\nAli, the alleged driver, faces a dozen charges, including attempted murder as a hate crime, as well as other hate crime charges.\n\nThe NYPD says that hate crimes are up 25 percent this year so far compared with the same period last year.

More than 24 hours after the incident, I had not heard anything about it. I Googled \"Asghar Ali\" to see just how much attention and coverage the attack was receiving.\n\nThe New York Times did a story on the attack, but it's nowhere near the front of its website. The same holds true for NBC News and ABC News. CNN has no story on the incident.\n\nA local radio station, 1010 WINS had New York City Mayor Eric Adams on its air on Wednesday. Here's a description of the interview on the radio station's website: \"Mayor Adams on WINS: Is NYC taking back Diddy's key to the city? Plus: The latest on the lifeguard shortage & possible Brooklyn hate crime.\"\n\nHmmm. The lifeguard shortage is more pressing news than a \"possible Brooklyn hate crime\"? Let's go back to the hypothetical scenario I painted at the beginning of the story. Would that be labeled as a \"possible hate crime\"?\n\nAli is charged with hate crimes in connection with the incident. He is facing more than 10 charges, including attempted murder as a hate crime.\n\nBased on what we've been told by the media and politicians, there is no greater threat to the United States than hate crimes or attacks on people based on their race, religion, or gender.

Overall, hate crimes were up 31%.\n\nThere had been 143 anti-Jewish crimes -- 51 more than the same time last year -- Kenny said.", "source": {"uri": "police1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Police1"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hasidic Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yeshiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Flatbush,_Brooklyn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Flatbush, Brooklyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://lexipol.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c705bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-lexipol.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd1%2F09%2F3082c9524fe0903962683135ae4d%2Fus-news-nyc-police-encounters-ny.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9610842", "eventUri": "eng-9610842", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 879, "textEnd": 885}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 940, "textEnd": 946}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

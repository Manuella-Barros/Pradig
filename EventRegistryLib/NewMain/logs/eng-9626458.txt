The Southern Poverty Law Center reported Tuesday that the number of white nationalist groups in the U.S. rose to a record high in 2023. (Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Emboldened by the mainstreaming of hard-right politics ahead of a presidential election cycle, white nationalist and anti-LGBTQ+ groups increased to record levels in the United States last year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center's latest annual report on hate and extremism released Tuesday.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, which has published the annual report since 1990, documented 835 active anti-government groups, up 133 from 2022's count, and 595 hate groups, an increase of 72 over the previous year's figure.\n\nAccounting for a large portion of the increase was a 50% surge in white supremacy hate groups in 2023, the highest jump ever recorded by the SPLC, growing to 165 over 109 in 2022. White power and neo-Nazi rallies across the U.S. totaled 143 in 2023, down from 191 in 2022.\n\nSPLC saw a 33% rise in anti-LGBTQ+ organizations over last year, bringing the total to 86. The group said the growth was largely attributable to the anti-trans movement on the far-right.\n\n\"What we're seeing now should be a wake-up call for all of us,\" Margaret Huang, SPLC's president and CEO, said on a call with reporters. \"Our 2023 report documented more hate and anti-government extremist groups than ever before. With a historic election just months away, these groups are multiplying, mobilizing and making, and in some cases already implementing, plans to undo democracy.\"\n\nHate groups have increased in-person events and leafleting, according to the report. The SPLC tracked nearly 7,000 flyering incidents last year, many including language derived from racist and antisemitic conspiracies.\n\nThe groups also launched campaigns to gain influence in mainstream politics, according to the report, namely through the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 manifesto that outlines aspirations for anti-abortion, anti-free press and anti-LGBTQ+ priorities should presumed GOP presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump win in November.\n\nNine of the anti-government and hate groups tracked by the SPLC are part of the coalition that supports Project 2025, the organization reports.\n\nAmong the states leading in numbers of anti-government and hate groups are California, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, Washington and Ohio.\n\nCalifornia topped the list with 51 hate and 66 anti-government groups.\n\nThe SPLC recorded the second-most groups in Florida, which has become a leader in book-banning incidents and restrictive policies on teachers. The Sunshine State is home to 43 hate and 71 anti-government organizations, according to the report, and is the birthplace of recently influential \"parental rights\" group Moms for Liberty.\n\nMoms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice was invited in March 2023 to testify before a U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary subcommittee then chaired by Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who is now House speaker.\n\nThe annual survey of hate groups tracked 116 hate-leafleting incidents in Florida, where the antisemitic groups rallied and flyered on multiple occasions, including over Labor Day when groups named the Goyim Defense League, The Order of the Black Sun and the Maine-based Blood Tribe marched in Orlando wielding flags with swastikas and making Nazi salutes.\n\nAntisemitism, already on the rise, became more pronounced following Israel's continuing offensive on the Gaza Strip following the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\n\"Antisemitic conspiracies seeped into mainstream narratives at an alarming pace and 2023. Specifically after Hamas's October 7 terrorist attack, the far right blurred the lines between legitimate criticism of the Israeli government's actions and outright antisemitism,\" R.G. Cravens, SPLC's senior research analyst for its Intelligence Project, said during Tuesday's call with reporters.\n\nFollowing the Hamas attack, the so-called Goyim Defense League distributed a flyer online and in person that read \"FREE PALESTINE,\" as a \"not-so-thinly-veiled attempt at stoking more antisemitism and using Palestinian people to further their own aims,\" according to the report.\n\nThe SPLC report also cited the expanding influence of extreme Christian nationalism as a driver for the growing number of anti-government organizations.\n\nThe report expresses concern over the rise in the Republican ranks of Johnson, a former senior lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy group behind the U.S. Supreme Court case that precipitated the overturning of the federal right to abortion.\n\nJohnson's far-right politics, including his anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ positions and his advocacy to blur Christianity and the state, are well documented.\n\nSpokespeople for Johnson did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nThe Alliance for Defending Freedom describes SPLC as a \"discredited\" and \"scandal-ridden group,\" and denounces the organization's \"hate map.\" The SPLC currently has an interactive U.S. map pinpointing locations of anti-government and hate groups.\n\n\"Eventually, their definition of hate included huge swaths of well-respected, mainstream, conservative America,\" according to a post on the Alliance for Defending Freedom website.\n\nThe SPLC report specifically warns about the rise of the National Apostolic Reformation, a Christian movement made up of \"dominionist leaders\" that aim to \"seize control\" of seven areas of society, including government, education and business.\n\nOne area in which the report documented a decline is in the militia movement, which suffered after the hundreds of Department of Justice prosecutions following the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe numbers of militias dropped to 52 in 2023, from 61 in 2022.\n\nOne of the most prominent militias, the Oath Keepers, significantly diminished its presence following the 2023 conviction and sentencing of its leader Stewart Rhodes for seditious conspiracy leading up to and during the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nThe Oath Keepers active militia chapters dropped to 10 in 2023 from 79 in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "wiki", "score":

The group said the growth was largely attributable to the anti-trans movement on the far-right.\n\n\"What we're seeing now should be a wake-up call for all of us,\" Margaret Huang, SPLC's president and CEO, said on a call with reporters. \"Our 2023 report documented more hate and anti-government extremist groups than ever before. With a historic election just months away, these groups are multiplying, mobilizing and making, and in some cases already implementing, plans to undo democracy.\"\n\nHate groups have increased in-person events and leafleting, according to the report. The SPLC tracked nearly 7,000 flyering incidents last year, many including language derived from racist and antisemitic conspiracies.\n\nThe groups also launched campaigns to gain influence in mainstream politics, according to the report, namely through the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 manifesto that outlines aspirations for anti-abortion, anti-free press and anti-LGBTQ+ priorities should presumed GOP presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump win in November.\n\nNine of the anti-government and hate groups tracked by the SPLC are part of the coalition that supports Project 2025, the organization reports.\n\nAmong the states leading in numbers of anti-government and hate groups are California, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, Washington and Ohio.\n\nGeorgia is the nation's eighth most populous state and had the eighth most hate or anti-government groups in 2023, with 49, according to the SPLC.\n\nCalifornia topped the list with 51 hate and 66 anti-government groups.\n\nThe SPLC recorded the second-most groups in Florida, which has become a leader in book-banning incidents and restrictive policies on teachers. The Sunshine State is home to 43 hate and 71 anti-government organizations, according to the report, and is the birthplace of recently influential \"parental rights\" group Moms for Liberty.\n\nMoms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice was invited in March 2023 to testify before a U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary subcommittee then chaired by Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who is now House speaker.\n\nThe annual survey of hate groups tracked 116 hate-leafleting incidents in Florida, where the antisemitic groups rallied and flyered on multiple occasions, including over Labor Day when groups named the Goyim Defense League, The Order of the Black Sun and the Maine-based Blood Tribe marched in Orlando wielding flags with swastikas and making Nazi salutes.\n\nAntisemitism, already on the rise, became more pronounced following Israel's continuing offensive on the Gaza Strip following the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\n\"Antisemitic conspiracies seeped into mainstream narratives at an alarming pace and 2023. Specifically after Hamas's October 7 terrorist attack, the far right blurred the lines between legitimate criticism of the Israeli government's actions and outright antisemitism,\" R.G. Cravens, SPLC's senior research analyst for its Intelligence Project, said during Tuesday's call with reporters.\n\nFollowing the Hamas attack, the so-called Goyim Defense League distributed a flyer online and in person that read \"FREE PALESTINE,\" as a \"not-so-thinly-veiled attempt at stoking more antisemitism and using Palestinian people to further their own aims,\" according to the report.\n\nThe SPLC's data shows the number of hate groups in Georgia waxing and waning since 2000, with spikes of 54 groups in 2003 and 65 groups in 2011, but the latest number represents a large increase compared with prior years. In 2022 and 2021, the SPLC only tracked 24 hate or antigovernment groups in Georgia.\n\nThe rise of such groups in Georgia may also coincide with its status as a swing state, said Rachel Carroll Rivas, interim director of SPLC's Intelligence Project.\n\n\"Georgia is an incredibly active state. It doesn't rank up quite as high as Florida, but there are some of the largest numbers of groups in Georgia compared to the U.S. I think that's in part because we find that, again, across the U.S., where there is a politically active state - you can almost map swing states in some ways - we find that there is a lot of activity on the far right.\"\n\nThe SPLC classifies Georgia's hate groups into categories including white nationalists, anti-LGBTQ, antigovernment, Christian identity, militias, conspiracy propagandists, antisemites and sovereign citizens.\n\nThe SPLC report also cited the expanding influence of extreme Christian nationalism as a driver for the growing number of anti-government organizations.\n\nThe report expresses concern over the rise in the Republican ranks of Johnson, a former senior lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy group behind the U.S. Supreme Court case that precipitated the overturning of the federal right to abortion.\n\nJohnson's far-right politics, including his anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ positions and his advocacy to blur Christianity and the state, are well documented.\n\nSpokespeople for Johnson did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nThe Alliance for Defending Freedom describes SPLC as a \"discredited\" and \"scandal-ridden group,\" and denounces the organization's \"hate map.\" The SPLC currently has an interactive U.S. map pinpointing locations of anti-government and hate groups.\n\n\"Eventually, their definition of hate included huge swaths of well-respected, mainstream, conservative America,\" according to a post on the Alliance for Defending Freedom website.\n\nThe SPLC report specifically warns about the rise of the National Apostolic Reformation, a Christian movement made up of \"dominionist leaders\" that aim to \"seize control\" of seven areas of society, including government, education and business.\n\nOne area in which the report documented a decline is in the militia movement, which suffered after the hundreds of Department of Justice prosecutions following the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe numbers of militias dropped to 52 in 2023, from 61 in 2022.\n\nOne of the most prominent militias, the Oath Keepers, significantly diminished its presence following the 2023 conviction and sentencing of its leader Stewart Rhodes for seditious conspiracy leading up to and during the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nThe Oath Keepers active militia chapters dropped to 10 in 2023 from 79 in 2022.", "source": {"uri":

White power and neo-Nazi rallies across the U.S. totaled 143 in 2023, down from 191 in 2022.\n\nSPLC saw a 33% rise in anti-LGBTQ+ organizations over last year, bringing the total to 86. The group said the growth was largely attributable to the anti-trans movement on the far-right.\n\n\"What we're seeing now should be a wake-up call for all of us,\" Margaret Huang, SPLC's president and CEO, said on a call with reporters. \"Our 2023 report documented more hate and anti-government extremist groups than ever before. With a historic election just months away, these groups are multiplying, mobilizing and making, and in some cases already implementing, plans to undo democracy.\"\n\nJill Biden tells audience at Pittsburgh Pride event 'your president loves you'\n\nHate groups have increased in-person events and leafleting, according to the report. The SPLC tracked nearly 7,000 flyering incidents last year, many including language derived from racist and antisemitic conspiracies.\n\nThe groups also launched campaigns to gain influence in mainstream politics, according to the report, namely through the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 manifesto that outlines aspirations for anti-abortion, anti-free press and anti-LGBTQ+ priorities should presumed GOP presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump win in November.\n\nNine of the anti-government and hate groups tracked by the SPLC are part of the coalition that supports Project 2025, the organization reports.\n\nAmong the states leading in numbers of anti-government and hate groups are California, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, Washington and Ohio.\n\nCalifornia topped the list with 51 hate and 66 anti-government groups.\n\nThe SPLC recorded the second-most groups in Florida, which has become a leader in book-banning incidents and restrictive policies on teachers. The Sunshine State is home to 43 hate and 71 anti-government organizations, according to the report, and is the birthplace of recently influential \"parental rights\" group Moms for Liberty.\n\nMoms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice was invited in March 2023 to testify before a U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary subcommittee then chaired by Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who is now House speaker.\n\nThe annual survey of hate groups tracked 116 hate-leafleting incidents in Florida, where the antisemitic groups rallied and flyered on multiple occasions, including over Labor Day when groups named the Goyim Defense League, The Order of the Black Sun and the Maine-based Blood Tribe marched in Orlando wielding flags with swastikas and making Nazi salutes.\n\nAntisemitism, already on the rise, became more pronounced following Israel's continuing offensive on the Gaza Strip following the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\n\"Antisemitic conspiracies seeped into mainstream narratives at an alarming pace and 2023. Specifically after Hamas's October 7 terrorist attack, the far right blurred the lines between legitimate criticism of the Israeli government's actions and outright antisemitism,\" R.G. Cravens, SPLC's senior research analyst for its Intelligence Project, said during Tuesday's call with reporters.\n\nFollowing the Hamas attack, the so-called Goyim Defense League distributed a flyer online and in person that read \"FREE PALESTINE,\" as a \"not-so-thinly-veiled attempt at stoking more antisemitism and using Palestinian people to further their own aims,\" according to the report.\n\nThe SPLC report also cited the expanding influence of extreme Christian nationalism as a driver for the growing number of anti-government organizations.\n\nThe report expresses concern over the rise in the Republican ranks of Johnson, a former senior lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy group behind the U.S. Supreme Court case that precipitated the overturning of the federal right to abortion.\n\nJohnson's far-right politics, including his anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ positions and his advocacy to blur Christianity and the state, are well documented.\n\nSpokespeople for Johnson did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nThe Alliance for Defending Freedom describes SPLC as a \"discredited\" and \"scandal-ridden group,\" and denounces the organization's \"hate map.\" The SPLC currently has an interactive U.S. map pinpointing locations of anti-government and hate groups.\n\n\"Eventually, their definition of hate included huge swaths of well-respected, mainstream, conservative America,\" according to a post on the Alliance for Defending Freedom website.\n\nThe SPLC report specifically warns about the rise of the National Apostolic Reformation, a Christian movement made up of \"dominionist leaders\" that aim to \"seize control\" of seven areas of society, including government, education and business.\n\nOne area in which the report documented a decline is in the militia movement, which suffered after the hundreds of Department of Justice prosecutions following the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe numbers of militias dropped to 52 in 2023, from 61 in 2022.\n\nOne of the most prominent militias, the Oath Keepers, significantly diminished its presence following the 2023 conviction and sentencing of its leader Stewart Rhodes for seditious conspiracy leading up to and during the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nThe Oath Keepers active militia chapters dropped to 10 in 2023 from 79 in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "penncapital-star.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pennsylvania Capital-Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_murray@penncapital-star.com", "name": "Ashley Murray", "type":

The number of such groups tracked last year stood at 1,225 -- a group of more than 200 such groups in one year.\n\nThe report provides a \"comprehensive analysis of the groups and organizational infrastructure upholding white supremacy in the United States,\" according to the press release.\n\nThese groups have \"intensified their efforts over the past year to recruit new members, increase their online presence and in-person demonstrations, exploit international and domestic conflicts, lobby the government and, in some cases, directly participate in elections, especially at the local level,\" SPLC officials warned, adding that communities of color, immigrant communities, minority faith communities and LGBTQ communities are \"all targeted by and experience the negative effects of hate-filled rhetoric and anti-government conspiracies through actions such as banning books, protesting drag story hours and using school boards as politcal battlegrounds.\n\nMargaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center and SPLC Action Fund, said, \"With a historic election just months away, this year, more than any other, we must act to preserve our democracy. That will require us to directly address the danger of hate and extremism from our schools to our statehouses.\n\n\"Our report exposes these far-right extremists and serves as a tool for advocates and communities working to counter disinformation, false conspiracies and threats to voters and election workers. Together, we can dismantle white supremacy and ensure all communities see themselves represented in our democracy.\"\n\nAmong the report's findings are that Christian supremacy and dominionism are \"animating features\" of anti-government conspiracies and organizing, with a goal to transform U.S. culture and politics into an authoritarian state. According to the SPLC press release, \"The New Apostolic Reformation is the latest chapter in dominionists' modern effort to make their reading of Christianity authoritative and supreme in everyone's lives -- representing the greatest threat to American democracy that most people have never heard of.\"\n\nThe report also shows that \"male supremacy\" continues to be a foundation for hate, and in 2023 an extreme segment of the anti-abortion movements \"mobilized supporters and consolidated their influence\" in state legislatures across the country, SPLC identified four anti-abortion extremists under the male supremacists hate group designation, including Operation Rescue and End Abortion Now.\n\nThe report also highlights the positive impact of those working to make communities more inclusive and less susceptible to extremism, highlighting how a civilian oversight board instituted a new policy prohibiting officers in the Chicago Police Department from belonging to extremist and hate groups. The report also shows how Drag Story Hour is countering LGBTQ bigotry with literacy programs across the country.\n\nRachel Carroll Rivas, interim director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, said, \"Despite an alarming spike in hard-right groups and actions, we are encouraged by communities who have joined together to push back against voices that are preaching division and hate.

That's an increase of more than 200 groups from 2022, according to SPLC's annual hate and extremism report released today.\n\nThe SPLC reported that it recorded more active anti-LGBTQ and white nationalist groups last year than any other year since it began documenting hate groups in 1990.\n\n\"What we're seeing now should be a wake up call for all of us. Our 2023 report documented more hate and anti-government extremist groups than ever before,\" said Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Montgomery-based SPLC. \"With a historic election just months away, these groups are multiplying, mobilizing, making, and in some cases already implementing, plans to undo democracy.\"\n\nIn Alabama, SPLC reported 12 extremist groups as being active in the state. While the number of groups remained relatively small compared to other states, they represent a range of neo-confederate, white nationalist and anti-government ideologies, according to SPLC.\n\nThe report lists several incidents that targeted libraries and LGBTQ, Black and Jewish Alabamians in 2023:\n\nThis year, the SPLC report put a particular focus on the Deep South -- Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana -- calling the region \"an organizing hub for anti-student inclusion groups in the anti-government movement.\"\n\nResearchers referred to children's hospitals being targeted because they provided healthcare to transgender youth and attacks on drag story hours. SPLC called those story hours community literacy programs that \"provide public goods, helping people overcome barriers to literacy and building connections that produce thriving, resilient and democratically engaged communities.\"\n\nResearch analysts at SPLC said lawmakers have \"built [legislation] on many of the conspiracies of these far-right ideologies,\" referencing trans healthcare bans, laws banning public drag performances and new restrictions on school curriculum, all of which have been passed or proposed in Alabama.\n\nAbortion bans, like the one passed in Alabama in 2022, were also listed as an example of hate groups influencing legislation. The SPLC for the first time began tracking 'male supremacy groups' which \"share a belief in men's perceived right to dominate and enforce strict gender norms onto women, trans men and nonbinary people.\"\n\nAccording to the report, during the year Roe was overturned, the National Abortion Federation documented a 913% increase in incidents of stalking, a 538% increase in clinic obstructions and a 133% increase in bomb threats targeting abortion providers and clinics in states that continued to protect abortion rights.\n\n\"With the emphasis on halting immigration at the southern border, denying rights to LGBTQ people, denying teachers the ability to talk about difficult topics like racism, and eliminating access to abortion, the mainstream right is pursuing a policy agenda that is very much in line with what the White Power movement would like to see enacted.

Cravens, a senior research analyst with the Intelligence Project, explained that flyering is \"a form of direct action designed to intimidate and harass communities of color, stoke fear, and suppress diversity, and the language used in it is often derived from racist and antisemitic conspiracies.\"\n\nIn Alabama, the SPLC documented a total of 120 hate flyering incidents, twelve attempts to ban books at public libraries, a Patriot Front protest at a Prattville pride parade, a road sign hacked to display hate slogans, a neo-Confederate conference in Wetumpka, and bomb threats received by Jewish organizations in several Alabama cities.\n\nIn addition to documenting hate and antigovernment groups, and their activity, the SPLC's report also provided a list of suggested policies to help combat bigotry and extremism.\n\nThese \"fourteen actions to stop hate\" ranged from holding everyone responsible for January 6 accountable to addressing white supremacy in the military and law enforcement, to promoting \"inclusive education and democracy-building school initiatives that celebrate our nation's diversity.\"\n\nHuang said the SPLC hopes that the takeaway from this year's report is \"both an affirmation of [communities'] experience and an understanding that it helps create for them of what they're seeing and observing and participating in in their communities, but also a galvanizing tool.\"", "source": {"uri": "alreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alabama Political Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chance_phillips@alreporter.com", "name": "Chance Phillips",

It later took the project it used to monitor the Klan and weaponized it against mainstream conservative and Christian nonprofits, putting them on a \"hate map\" along with Klan chapters.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SPLC raised the alarm about having \"documented 86 active anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups -- about 33% higher than 2022, and the highest number ever recorded by the SPLC.\"\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nOf course, the SPLC isn't \"documenting\" these \"hate groups\" -- it's smearing organizations by comparing them to the real hate of the Klan. By warning about the \"increase\" of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups,\" it is ratcheting up the alarmist rhetoric and demonizing Americans who dare to dissent from its transgender agenda. It's also scaring donors into ponying up cash in what a former SPLC employee described as a \"highly profitable scam.\"\n\nMost of the increase in its count of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups\" comes from the SPLC's decision to add state-based family policy councils, groups of doctors who oppose transgender medical interventions, and chapters of the group Gays Against Groomers to the list. These groups don't support \"hate\" -- they merely oppose the SPLC's agenda.\n\nThe SPLC added to the list policy groups that oppose radical laws to promote transgender identity. These groups support legislation to ensure that males cannot enter women's restrooms, locker rooms, and prisons in the name of gender identity; legislation to protect children from \"gender-affirming care\" that may sterilize them; and legislation to prevent schools from hiding children's \"transgender\" identity from parents.\n\nThese new \"hate groups\" are: Advocates Protecting Children in Virginia, the California Policy Council, the Center for Christian Virtue in Ohio, the Child and Parent Rights Campaign in Georgia, the Family Action Council of Tennessee, the Florida Family Policy Council, Frontline Policy Council in Georgia, the Louisiana Family Forum, Massachusetts Family Institute, the Montana Family Foundation, Pennsylvania Family Institute, and the Family Foundation of Virginia.\n\nThe SPLC also demonized groups of doctors who oppose experimental \"transgender\" medical interventions. These interventions, euphemistically referred to as \"gender-affirming care,\" involve drugs to block puberty, cross-sex hormones to make males seem female and vice versa, and surgeries to remove healthy reproductive organs. While much of the medical industry has been captured by gender ideologues who champion these interventions, many brave doctors have spoken out against them. Now, they find themselves on a map with the Klan in a report on \"white supremacy.\"\n\nThese groups include Do No Harm, Genspect, Partners for Ethical Care, and the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine.\n\nThe \"Year in Hate\" report also cites another report the SPLC released last year that demonized opposition to transgender orthodoxy as \"pseudoscience\" and a tool of \"theocracy.\"\n\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the SPLC also added an explicitly homosexual group to the anti-LGBTQ+ category this year: Gays Against Groomers. The group began as a Twitter account created by Jaimee Michell, and according to the SPLC, it has four chapters. The headquarters in Milwaukee has three offshoots in Missouri, North Carolina, and Washington.\n\nMichell started Gays Against Groomers to warn against the sexualization of children and to highlight the fact that not all people who identify as LGBTQ+ support sexual lessons and events geared toward kids. The SPLC condemns Gays Against Groomers for making \"amplifying anti-trans and anti-drag messaging key to its online and in-person activity.\"\n\nThe SPLC dismisses any concern that LGBTQ+ lessons and events might sexualize children and make them vulnerable to abuse. In fact, the report on \"Hate and Extremism\" trumpets the phenomenon referred to as \"Drag Queen Story Hour,\" in which scantily clad men in exaggerated feminine dress and makeup read books to children.\n\n\"Drag, which often challenges strict adherence to binary gender roles, poses a problem for hate and antigovernment groups because it offers freedom from the restrictive ideologies they espouse,\" the SPLC's R.G. Cravens claims.\n\nHe also argues that \"drag performs an important role in American democracy in addition to its artistic value,\" because \"drag artists\" can use their platform to \"educate people on the importance of voting and other forms of democratic engagement.\"\n\nCravens never admits the sexualized nature of Drag Queen Story Hour. Instead, he demonizes opposition to it by suggesting that it is rooted in hatred. He claims that \"the activities of anti-LGBTQ+ groups overlapped with white nationalist, neo-Nazi, antisemitic, and antigovernment groups who targeted LGBTQ+ people and events for intimidation and violent campaigns designed to drive LGBTQ+ people from public life.\"\n\nHe also suggests that any criticism of drag's hyper-sexualized interpretation of femininity is rooted in knuckle-dragging misogyny.\n\n\"By upending the notion that women are inherently feminine and men are inherently masculine, for example, drag challenges long-held sexist notions that women are a 'weaker sex' who should be subservient to men because they are only valuable for procreation,\" Cravens writes.\n\nCravens claims the SPLC tracked \"195 incidents of right-wing protesters targeting drag events across the country\" in 2023, suggesting these protests were violent. He mentions isolated incidents of real violence unconnected to any of the mainstream organizations the SPLC brands \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups.\"\n\nThe SPLC again kept many mainstream conservative Christian groups on the list of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups,\" most notably the law firm Alliance Defending Freedom and the think tank Family Research Council.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom has won numerous cases at the U.S. Supreme Court, including free speech and religious freedom cases like 303 Creative v. Elenis and Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Even Alliance Defending Freedom's ideological opponents, such as former American Civil Liberties Union President Nadine Strossen, have condemned the SPLC's smear against the law firm.\n\nBoth Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council have repeatedly debunked the SPLC's accusations against them, yet the SPLC continues to repeat its claims.\n\nIn 2012, the Family Research Council suffered a terrorist attack from a man who used the SPLC \"hate map\" to target the organization. While the SPLC condemned the attack, it has kept the Family Research Council on the map.\n\nLast year, the SPLC added parental rights groups -- including Moms for Liberty -- to the \"hate map,\" in part because they oppose transgender lessons in school.\n\nThe SPLC has suffered many scandals. It paid more than $3 million to settle a defamation lawsuit from a Muslim reformer the SPLC had branded an \"anti-Muslim extremist\" in 2018. It fired its co-founder, Morris Dees, amid a racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal in 2019. Even so, many legacy media outlets, Democrats, and companies use the SPLC as an arbiter of what is considered \"hate.\" The Biden administration has repeatedly worked with the SPLC, with a Justice Department division listening to an SPLC briefing on the \"hate map.\"\n\nThe SPLC owes its bread and butter to demonizing conservatives, and no one should take its claims at face value.", "source":

Sign up for the Morning Memo newsletter\n\nLast year, there were more hate and anti-government extremist groups in the United States than ever before, according to Southern Poverty Law Center's new report, \"The Year In Hate and Extremism 2023.\"\n\nIn 2023, SPLC documented a total of 1,430 hate and anti-government extremist groups in the U.S., according to the report. 835 of these were anti-government groups. That's an increase of 133 or 19% from 2022.\n\nThe record numbers of active hate and extremist groups is undoubtedly associated with the rise and popularity of hard-right ideologies, the report's authors said.\n\nOver the past couple of years extremist ideology has infiltrated a faction of the Republican Party. The emergence of more and more MAGA Republicans and far-right lawmakers in elected positions and the halls of Congress has caused a shift in the nation's political DNA, creating an environment where anti-government rhetoric and extremism are often a daily component of national and state political news coverage.\n\n\"Increasing numbers of elected officials and influencers on the far right are turning to conspiracy and theocracy in their politics, finding particular support for these ideas in the Republican Party,\" the report reads.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is one of these lawmakers. Johnson's ties to far-right groups and ideology has been well documented by the media. But the SPLC notes Johnson's ability to rise to one of the most influential positions on Capitol Hill is illustrative of that shift.\n\nJohnson has previously \"mimicked white supremacist 'great replacement' conspiracy rhetoric,\" according to the report. In 2016, he claimed the U.S. is a \"biblical republic\" and not a democracy. And, of course, in 2020, he supported a Texas lawsuit that tried to throw out the votes from four battleground states and overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\nJohnson was also previously a litigator and spokesperson for the anti-LGBTQ group Alliance Defending Freedom. ADF claims credit for helping overturn Roe v. Wade and ending constitutional protections for abortion.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson's ascension, despite his association with the hate group and parroting of conspiracy, is testament to the level of influence these theocratic ideologies wield within the Republican Party,\" the report reads.\n\nThe influence between far-right lawmakers and anti-government groups is a \"two-way street,\" Travis McAdam, a senior research analyst at the SPLC, told TPM in a statement.\n\n\"In some cases, officials literally come from antigovernment circles. That's where they become activated and receive their political education. They then carry those antigovernment ideas and worldview into how they perform their duties after being elected,\" McAdam detailed. \"In other cases, antigovernment groups are able to identify and influence officials who are open to pieces of their conspiracies and claims. Both dynamics help explain how we routinely see ideas that originate in the antigovernment movement used as talking points by elected officials or as the basis for proposed policy.\"", "source": {"uri": "talkingpointsmemo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Talking Points Memo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emine_yucel@talkingpointsmemo.com", "name": "Emine Y\u00fccel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Points_Memo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talking Points Memo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Defending_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alliance Defending Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

There has been a steady increase in the Grand Canyon State since 2000.\n\n\"What we are seeing now should be a wake up call to all of us,\" Margaret Huang, CEO of the SPLC, said in a call with reporters Tuesday morning. The increase is a continued trend, as last year's report on 2022 saw similar increases.\n\nOf Arizona's 38 groups, 18 are hate groups aimed at minority groups or women, while the remaining 20 are classified as anti-government groups.\n\n\"Antisemitic narratives seeped into mainstream narratives at an alarming rate in 2023,\" R.G. Cravens, a senior researcher for SPLC, told reporters. Cravens cited the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine as aiding in inciting certain antisemitic hate groups.\n\nMany of these groups are participating more in demonstrations and flyering. The SPLC stressed that many of these groups, despite some shared beliefs, operate as a \"loose decentralized network of organizations.\"\n\nThe SPLC noted a 50% increase in white nationalist organizations across the country, something it attributed to extremists feeling emboldened by politicians engaging with policy ideas that have long been supported by extremist groups.\n\nIn particular, white nationalist groups participated in a large number of anti-LGBTQ demonstrations, with nearly 50% of all their demonstrations aimed at the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"The mainstream right is pursuing a policy agenda that is very much in line with what the white power movement wants,\" Cassie Miller, a senior researcher at SPLC, said.\n\nSome of those policy ideas include \"male supremacist\" ideologies that target women and advocate taking away their reproductive rights and other forms of autonomy. Arizona was one of 10 states that introduced legislation aimed at abolishing abortion supported by these male supremacist groups.\n\nArizona also made news for some of its anti-LGBTQ demonstrations, including an assault on an ASU professor by two members of Phoenix-based Turning Point USA. A number of drag story hours were also disrupted in the state, with one receiving a bomb threat while children were actively in the building.\n\nHuang stressed that, given this is an election year, more attention needs to be focused on these groups which are already aiming to intervene in the upcoming election and some are actively seeking office.\n\n\"We must act now to counter disinformation, radicalization and threats to voters and election workers,\" Huang said. \"More than ever, it is imperative that we preserve and strengthen our democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "tucsonsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tucson Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jerod_macdonald_evoy@tucsonsentinel.com", "name": "Jerod MacDonald-Evoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hate group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Canyon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand Canyon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Point_USA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turning Point USA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supremacism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Intersexed", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Intersexed", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Research_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Research Groups", "wgt": 24}], "image": "https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/files/entryimages/060723-proud-boys-rally-fd_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626458", "eventUri": "eng-9626458", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

It later took the project it used to monitor the Klan and weaponized it against mainstream conservative and Christian nonprofits, putting them on a \"hate map\" along with Klan chapters.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SPLC raised the alarm about having \"documented 86 active anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups -- about 33% higher than 2022, and the highest number ever recorded by the SPLC.\"\n\nOf course, the SPLC isn't \"documenting\" these \"hate groups\" -- it's smearing organizations by comparing them to the real hate of the Klan. By warning about the \"increase\" of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups,\" it is ratcheting up the alarmist rhetoric and demonizing Americans who dare to dissent from its transgender agenda. It's also scaring donors into ponying up cash in what a former SPLC employee described as a \"highly profitable scam.\"\n\nMost of the increase in its count of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups\" comes from the SPLC's decision to add state-based family policy councils, groups of doctors who oppose transgender medical interventions, and chapters of the group Gays Against Groomers to the list. These groups don't support \"hate\" -- they merely oppose the SPLC's agenda.\n\nThe SPLC added to the list policy groups that oppose radical laws to promote transgender identity. These groups support legislation to ensure that males cannot enter women's restrooms, locker rooms, and prisons in the name of gender identity; legislation to protect children from \"gender-affirming care\" that may sterilize them; and legislation to prevent schools from hiding children's \"transgender\" identity from parents.\n\nThese new \"hate groups\" are: Advocates Protecting Children in Virginia, the California Policy Council, the Center for Christian Virtue in Ohio, the Child and Parent Rights Campaign in Georgia, the Family Action Council of Tennessee, the Florida Family Policy Council, Frontline Policy Council in Georgia, the Louisiana Family Forum, Massachusetts Family Institute, the Montana Family Foundation, Pennsylvania Family Institute, and the Family Foundation of Virginia.\n\nThe SPLC also demonized groups of doctors who oppose experimental \"transgender\" medical interventions. These interventions, euphemistically referred to as \"gender-affirming care,\" involve drugs to block puberty, cross-sex hormones to make males seem female and vice versa, and surgeries to remove healthy reproductive organs. While much of the medical industry has been captured by gender ideologues who champion these interventions, many brave doctors have spoken out against them. Now, they find themselves on a map with the Klan in a report on \"white supremacy.\"\n\nThese groups include Do No Harm, Genspect, Partners for Ethical Care, and the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine.\n\nThe \"Year in Hate\" report also cites another report the SPLC released last year that demonized opposition to transgender orthodoxy as \"pseudoscience\" and a tool of \"theocracy.\"\n\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the SPLC also added an explicitly homosexual group to the anti-LGBTQ+ category this year: Gays Against Groomers. The group began as a Twitter account created by Jaimee Michell, and according to the SPLC, it has four chapters. The headquarters in Milwaukee has three offshoots in Missouri, North Carolina, and Washington.\n\nMichell started Gays Against Groomers to warn against the sexualization of children and to highlight the fact that not all people who identify as LGBTQ+ support sexual lessons and events geared toward kids. The SPLC condemns Gays Against Groomers for making \"amplifying anti-trans and anti-drag messaging key to its online and in-person activity.\"\n\nThe SPLC dismisses any concern that LGBTQ+ lessons and events might sexualize children and make them vulnerable to abuse. In fact, the report on \"Hate and Extremism\" trumpets the phenomenon referred to as \"Drag Queen Story Hour,\" in which scantily clad men in exaggerated feminine dress and makeup read books to children.\n\n\"Drag, which often challenges strict adherence to binary gender roles, poses a problem for hate and antigovernment groups because it offers freedom from the restrictive ideologies they espouse,\" the SPLC's R.G. Cravens claims.\n\nHe also argues that \"drag performs an important role in American democracy in addition to its artistic value,\" because \"drag artists\" can use their platform to \"educate people on the importance of voting and other forms of democratic engagement.\"\n\nCravens never admits the sexualized nature of Drag Queen Story Hour. Instead, he demonizes opposition to it by suggesting that it is rooted in hatred. He claims that \"the activities of anti-LGBTQ+ groups overlapped with white nationalist, neo-Nazi, antisemitic, and antigovernment groups who targeted LGBTQ+ people and events for intimidation and violent campaigns designed to drive LGBTQ+ people from public life.\"\n\nHe also suggests that any criticism of drag's hyper-sexualized interpretation of femininity is rooted in knuckle-dragging misogyny.\n\n\"By upending the notion that women are inherently feminine and men are inherently masculine, for example, drag challenges long-held sexist notions that women are a 'weaker sex' who should be subservient to men because they are only valuable for procreation,\" Cravens writes.\n\nCravens claims the SPLC tracked \"195 incidents of right-wing protesters targeting drag events across the country\" in 2023, suggesting these protests were violent. He mentions isolated incidents of real violence unconnected to any of the mainstream organizations the SPLC brands \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups.\"\n\nThe SPLC again kept many mainstream conservative Christian groups on the list of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups,\" most notably the law firm Alliance Defending Freedom and the think tank Family Research Council.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom has won numerous cases at the U.S. Supreme Court, including free speech and religious freedom cases like 303 Creative v. Elenis and Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Even Alliance Defending Freedom's ideological opponents, such as former American Civil Liberties Union President Nadine Strossen, have condemned the SPLC's smear against the law firm.\n\nBoth Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council have repeatedly debunked the SPLC's accusations against them, yet the SPLC continues to repeat its claims.\n\nIn 2012, the Family Research Council suffered a terrorist attack from a man who used the SPLC \"hate map\" to target the organization.

Pictured: SPLC's 2023 \"hate map.\" (Illustration: Southern Poverty Law Center)\n\nThe Left's main smear organ has targeted an openly gay organization and groups of doctors who oppose \"gender-affirming care\" in efforts to silence opposition to the transgender agenda and drag queen story hours.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center released its \"Year in Hate and Extremism\" report Tuesday, warning about encroaching \"theocracy\" and an \"authoritarian takeover\" as part of the \"organizational infrastructure ... upholding white supremacy in the United States.\"\n\nAs I explain in my book, \"Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center,\" the SPLC gained fame by suing the Ku Klux Klan into bankruptcy. It later took the project it used to monitor the Klan and weaponized it against mainstream conservative and Christian nonprofits, putting them on a \"hate map\" along with Klan chapters.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SPLC raised the alarm about having \"documented 86 active anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups -- about 33% higher than 2022, and the highest number ever recorded by the SPLC.\"\n\nOf course, the SPLC isn't \"documenting\" these \"hate groups\" -- it's smearing organizations by comparing them to the real hate of the Klan. By warning about the \"increase\" of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups,\" it is ratcheting up the alarmist rhetoric and demonizing Americans who dare to dissent from its transgender agenda. It's also scaring donors into ponying up cash in what a former SPLC employee described as a \"highly profitable scam.\"\n\nMost of the increase in its count of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups\" comes from the SPLC's decision to add state-based family policy councils, groups of doctors who oppose transgender medical interventions, and chapters of the group Gays Against Groomers to the list. These groups don't support \"hate\" -- they merely oppose the SPLC's agenda.\n\nThe SPLC added to the list policy groups that oppose radical laws to promote transgender identity. These groups support legislation to ensure that males cannot enter women's restrooms, locker rooms, and prisons in the name of gender identity; legislation to protect children from \"gender-affirming care\" that may sterilize them; and legislation to prevent schools from hiding children's \"transgender\" identity from parents.\n\nThese new \"hate groups\" are: Advocates Protecting Children in Virginia, the California Policy Council, the Center for Christian Virtue in Ohio, the Child and Parent Rights Campaign in Georgia, the Family Action Council of Tennessee, the Florida Family Policy Council, Frontline Policy Council in Georgia, the Louisiana Family Forum, Massachusetts Family Institute, the Montana Family Foundation, Pennsylvania Family Institute, and the Family Foundation of Virginia.\n\nThe SPLC also demonized groups of doctors who oppose experimental \"transgender\" medical interventions. These interventions, euphemistically referred to as \"gender-affirming care,\" involve drugs to block puberty, cross-sex hormones to make males seem female and vice versa, and surgeries to remove healthy reproductive organs. While much of the medical industry has been captured by gender ideologues who champion these interventions, many brave doctors have spoken out against them. Now, they find themselves on a map with the Klan in a report on \"white supremacy.\"\n\nThese groups include Do No Harm, Genspect, Partners for Ethical Care, and the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine.\n\nThe \"Year in Hate\" report also cites another report the SPLC released last year that demonized opposition to transgender orthodoxy as \"pseudoscience\" and a tool of \"theocracy.\"\n\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the SPLC also added an explicitly homosexual group to the anti-LGBTQ+ category this year: Gays Against Groomers. The group began as a Twitter account created by Jaimee Michell, and according to the SPLC, it has four chapters. The headquarters in Milwaukee has three offshoots in Missouri, North Carolina, and Washington.\n\nMichell started Gays Against Groomers to warn against the sexualization of children and to highlight the fact that not all people who identify as LGBTQ+ support sexual lessons and events geared toward kids. The SPLC condemns Gays Against Groomers for making \"amplifying anti-trans and anti-drag messaging key to its online and in-person activity.\"\n\nThe SPLC dismisses any concern that LGBTQ+ lessons and events might sexualize children and make them vulnerable to abuse. In fact, the report on \"Hate and Extremism\" trumpets the phenomenon referred to as \"Drag Queen Story Hour,\" in which scantily clad men in exaggerated feminine dress and makeup read books to children.\n\n\"Drag, which often challenges strict adherence to binary gender roles, poses a problem for hate and antigovernment groups because it offers freedom from the restrictive ideologies they espouse,\" the SPLC's R.G. Cravens claims.\n\nHe also argues that \"drag performs an important role in American democracy in addition to its artistic value,\" because \"drag artists\" can use their platform to \"educate people on the importance of voting and other forms of democratic engagement.\"\n\nCravens never admits the sexualized nature of Drag Queen Story Hour. Instead, he demonizes opposition to it by suggesting that it is rooted in hatred. He claims that \"the activities of anti-LGBTQ+ groups overlapped with white nationalist, neo-Nazi, antisemitic, and antigovernment groups who targeted LGBTQ+ people and events for intimidation and violent campaigns designed to drive LGBTQ+ people from public life.\"\n\nHe also suggests that any criticism of drag's hyper-sexualized interpretation of femininity is rooted in knuckle-dragging misogyny.\n\n\"By upending the notion that women are inherently feminine and men are inherently masculine, for example, drag challenges long-held sexist notions that women are a 'weaker sex' who should be subservient to men because they are only valuable for procreation,\" Cravens writes.\n\nCravens claims the SPLC tracked \"195 incidents of right-wing protesters targeting drag events across the country\" in 2023, suggesting these protests were violent. He mentions isolated incidents of real violence unconnected to any of the mainstream organizations the SPLC brands \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups.\"\n\nThe SPLC again kept many mainstream conservative Christian groups on the list of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups,\" most notably the law firm Alliance Defending Freedom and the think tank Family Research Council.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom has won numerous cases at the U.S. Supreme Court, including free speech and religious freedom cases like 303 Creative v. Elenis and Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Even Alliance Defending Freedom's ideological opponents, such as former American Civil Liberties Union President Nadine Strossen, have condemned the SPLC's smear against the law firm.\n\nBoth Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council have repeatedly debunked the SPLC's accusations against them, yet the SPLC continues to repeat its claims.\n\nIn 2012, the Family Research Council suffered a terrorist attack from a man who used the SPLC \"hate map\" to target the organization. While the SPLC condemned the attack, it has kept the Family Research Council on the map.\n\nLast year, the SPLC added parental rights groups -- including Moms for Liberty -- to the \"hate map,\" in part because they oppose transgender lessons in school.\n\nThe SPLC has suffered many scandals. It paid more than $3 million to settle a defamation lawsuit from a Muslim reformer the SPLC had branded an \"anti-Muslim extremist\" in 2018. It fired its co-founder, Morris Dees, amid a racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal in 2019. Even so, many legacy media outlets, Democrats, and companies use the SPLC as an arbiter of what is considered \"hate.\" The Biden administration has repeatedly worked with the SPLC, with a Justice Department division listening to an SPLC briefing on the \"hate map.\"\n\nThe SPLC owes its bread and butter to demonizing conservatives, and no one should take its claims at face value.", "source":

A former employee called this a \"highly profitable scam,\" and some conservatives consider landing on the SPLC's \"hate map\" to be a badge of honor.\n\nThe \"hate map\" includes many prominent organizations, such as Alliance Defending Freedom, which has won multiple Supreme Court cases; Moms for Liberty, which has mobilized a parental rights movement across the country; prominent immigration groups such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform and the Center for Immigration Studies; and many more.\n\nSome of these organizations advised Donald Trump when he was president, a fact the SPLC uses to smear Trump while still suggesting these are fringe \"hate\" and \"antigovernment\" groups -- because they oppose the SPLC's agenda on education, LGBTQ issues, immigration, or other causes.\n\nRabbi Yaakov Menken, managing director of the Coalition for Jewish Values, which represents more than 2,000 Orthodox Jewish rabbis in American public policy, quipped that he was crestfallen to see the latest \"hate map.\"\n\n\"I called it last year -- in a speech before Moms for Liberty, I mentioned they were added, and I said I'm very offended,\" Menken told The Daily Signal on Wednesday. \"CJV also supports parental rights, traditional values, and religious liberty, so why won't they list us as a hate group?\"\n\nThe New Tolerance Campaign, a group that calls for equal standards of tolerance in opposition to the woke agenda, is also conspicuously absent from the SPLC's \"hate map.\"\n\n\"\"The SPLC's hate and extremist lists have included a group that argued cases before the Supreme Court, an Irving Kristol Award winner, and a brain surgeon who later became a Cabinet secretary,\" New Tolerance Campaign President Gregory Angelo told The Daily Signal in a statement Wednesday. \"It's clear the New Tolerance Campaign needs to step up our game if we have any hope of making the cut next year.\"\n\nAngelo was referring to Alliance Defending Freedom, the scholar Charles Murray, and neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who became secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2017. Although Murray and Carson don't appear on the \"hate map,\" the SPLC had put both men on its \"extremist list.\" (The SPLC removed Carson from the list in 2015.)\n\nWhile Angelo noted the prominence of SPLC targets, others mentioned the fact that the organization's \"hate map\" inspired an act of domestic terrorism.\n\n\"Southern Poverty Law Center's actions have resulted in acts of domestic terrorism, yet this extremist group sanctimoniously claims to know what 'hate' is? What a pathetic joke,\" Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America, told The Daily Signal on Wednesday.\n\n\"CWA has been in SPLC's crosshairs in the past but it seems they are incapable of keeping track of all the Americans who believe in God, faith, family and in our constitutional principles,\" Nance said. \"We are still the majority in the country, no matter how hard SPLC tries to slander and shame us.\"\n\nNance was referring to a shooting in 2012. A terrorist targeted Family Research Council, a conservative Christian nonprofit in Washington, D.C., for a mass shooting after finding the group on the SPLC \"hate map.\" The building manager foiled the terrorist's plan, but was shot and wounded in the process. The SPLC condemned the attack but has kept Family Research Council on its \"hate map\" ever since.\n\nThe SPLC repeatedly has attacked Concerned Women for America as \"anti-gay\" since 2010, but has never put the group on the \"hate map.\"\n\nJennifer Lahl, founder of the Center for Bioethics and Culture Network, noted that prominent critics of gender ideology such as herself have landed on the \"hate map.\"\n\nThe SPLC's 2023 \"hate map,\" released Tuesday, includes organizations of doctors who oppose experimental transgender medical interventions euphemistically referred to as \"gender-affirming care.\" The doctor groups Do No Harm, Genspect, Partners for Ethical Care, and the Society for Evidence-Based Medicine, or SEGM, appear on the \"hate map.\"\n\n\"It is very confusing to me who the SPLC selects to be targeted as hate groups on their map,\" Lahl told The Daily Signal. \"What is their exact selection criteria?\"\n\n\"Our organization has produced three documentaries focused on the debate around medicalizing those who feel as if they might have been born in the wrong body,\" Lahl said. \"Our book 'The Detransition Diaries' highlights the history of the scandal of 'gender affirmation therapy' and dares to allow those who have detransitioned to have a platform to speak and tell their stories.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we have flown under the radar and need to make much more noise calling medical professionals to account so we can get our badge of honor,\" she added. \"I would be happy to be included within the ranks of SEGM, Genspect, and Do No Harm.\"\n\nThese conservatives consider the Southern Poverty Law Center's \"hate map\" to be a joke and inclusion on it to be something like a badge of honor, but the Biden administration doesn't appear to be laughing. SPLC leaders and staff have visited the White House at least 18 times under Biden, and multiple federal agencies -- including the DOJ and Department of Education -- have taken briefings on \"hate\" from the smear group.\n\nThe Biden administration should realize what these conservatives have long known -- the SPLC's \"hate map\" is little more than a partisan tool of defamation and fundraising. It is a laughingstock, and it became worse when the SPLC put an openly gay group on the list of \"anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups.\"\n\nSadly, it seems the administration has no sense of humor.", "source":

At all.\n\nThis is one of those.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center recently released its \"year in hate & extremism\" report for 2023, a grim service the nonprofit organization has provided for decades.\n\nThis time around, the group says it tracked 1,430 extremist operations all over the U.S., including 38 -- count 'em, 38 -- in Arizona.\n\nReporter Jerod MacDonald-Evoy, formerly of The Arizona Republic, wrote about the latest report for the Arizona Mirror. He's tracked hate groups in Arizona for some time, doing ugly, necessary work.\n\nArizona's extremists are pervasive and varied\n\nThe CEO of the law center, Margaret Huang, said of the organization's most recent report, \"What we are seeing now should be a wake-up call to all of us.\"\n\nYes, it should be. But somehow it never is.\n\nNothing about hate or extremism shocks us anymore.\n\nStill, the report is well worth reading, given that our beautiful desert paradise finds its way into the discussion numerous times, ranging from efforts to demonize immigrants to the targeting of the LGBTQ+ community, racism, antisemitism and more.\n\nIf you have followed the news at all over the past several years you already know about some of this. But you may not have considered how pervasive or varied Arizona's extremists have become.\n\nWhat we need, given that, is a handy-dandy scorecard, which the center's report provides.\n\nThat includes white nationalists and conspiracists\n\nIt breaks down Arizona's 38 extremist operations into two categories -- 18 hate groups and 20 antigovernment groups.\n\nOf the 18 hate groups, the SLPC says that five are anti-LGBTQ+, four are \"general\" hate groups, one is a male supremacy group, two are neo-Nazi, two are neo-V\u00f6lkisch and five are white nationalist.\n\nOf the 20 antigovernment groups, it says that nine of them are \"general\" antigovernment groups, two are conspiracy propagandists, three involve the constitutional sheriff movement, five are militias and one is a sovereign citizen group.\n\nArizona voter conspiracy: Gets a polite smackdown\n\nThe report provides definitions for those of us unfamiliar with some of the intricacies of hate.\n\nFor example, it tells us that \"at the heart of much neo-V\u00f6lkisch ideology lies the unfounded fear of the purported replacement of white individuals.\"\n\nArizona politicians regurgitate their views\n\nWe've heard a lot about white replacement in Arizona.\n\nFailed governor candidate Kari Lake, now running for U.S. Senate, has regurgitated the ugly theory.\n\nRepublican U.S. Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs refused to sign a pledge denouncing \"white supremacy,\" as well as the \"great replacement theory.\"\n\nRepublican State Sen. Wendy Rogers also has boldly embraced and promoted replacement theory, which generally holds that nonwhite migrants are being used to \"replace\" white culture and political power.\n\nAlso, if you are unfamiliar with constitutional sheriff ideology, the report tells you that proponents believe \"the county -- not the state or federal governments -- should control all land within its borders, and the county sheriff should be the ultimate law enforcement authority in the U.S.\"\n\nThe SPLC reports says that hate and extremist groups have been growing steadily in recent years.\n\n(Gee, it's almost like there is a national political figure encouraging such beliefs in vulnerable cult-like followers using grievance-based conspiracy theories and dangerously threatening rhetoric.)\n\nAnd it's not new to Arizona.\n\nBack in 2015, the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, participated in an event called \"Liberty On Tap\" at the Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill at Tempe Marketplace.\n\nRep. Biggs, who was then the Arizona Senate president, also participated in the event.\n\nRhodes, in his remarks to the gathering, called Sen. John McCain a traitor.\n\nHe said in part, \"John Cain (yes, he dropped the Mc from the senator's name) is a traitor to the Constitution. He should be tried for treason before a jury of his peers -- which he would deny you ...\n\n\"He would deny you the right for trial to jury, but we will give him a trial for jury, and then after we convict him, he should be hung by neck until dead.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Rhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his part in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and was sentenced to 18 years in prison.\n\nFor those of you looking to maintain your hate and extremism scorecard, count Rhodes and many like him among those hoping for a presidential pardon should you-know-who get elected.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name": "Arizona Republic", "type": "author",

| BreakingNews.ie", "body": "Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP have criticised the Conservative government as Northern Ireland's main political parties welcomed news of a General Election.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Rishi Sunak fired the starting gun for campaigning on Wednesday, party leaders took aim at the Conservatives and focused on the UK government's Legacy Act as well as funding levels supplied to Northern Ireland.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's leader in Northern Ireland said the Westminster elections are an opportunity to send a clear message to the UK government that \"systemic underfunding of public services must end\".\n\nMichelle O'Neill said: \"The Tory government has been a disaster for the people in the north - bad for the economy, bad for public services and bad for workers and families as the cost of living soared, putting them under pressure.\"\n\nShe said voters could send a message that they want decisions about their life and future to be \"made here in Ireland, and not in London\".\n\nShe added: \"You can vote for a future where our children have the best opportunities to build their lives here at home.\n\n\"A shared future, where all our people and communities work together as one.\"\n\nHistorically, elected Sinn F\u00e9in MPs have refused to take their seats at Westminster.\n\nSetting out his party stall, the DUP leader said that the UK government is \"fast running out of steam\".\n\nGavin Robinson said polling day will provide the people of Northern Ireland with \"a clear choice as to who they think is best placed to represent them and deliver the best outcomes for them\".\n\nHe said: \"While political progress and new mechanisms were secured in negotiations with the Conservative government to allow the Assembly and Executive to be re-established, the next government will have much more to do to ensure Northern Ireland benefits as an integral part of the United Kingdom rather than remaining subject to European laws in some areas of our daily lives.\"\n\nHe added: \"We will use the forthcoming campaign to make the case that now more than ever is the time to strengthen the Unionist position - not divide and weaken it.\n\n\"Over the next number of weeks, we will campaign and seek votes to strengthen the pro-Union position.\n\n\"At this election, Unionists know that it is the Democratic Unionist Party that has the strength and depth to be able to make the pro-Union case and to unashamedly make the case for Northern Ireland in Parliament.\"\n\nThe statement came hours after it was announced his predecessor Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who is facing a series of historical sex offence charges, will not contest the General Election.\n\nHis solicitor made the confirmation after a judge fixed a date for a hearing to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to send Donaldson to trial.\n\nReacting to the election announcement, the leader of Alliance said her party is the \"main challenger to DUP\".\n\nNaomi Long said: \"Our positivity, progressiveness, responsibility and record of delivery is what we will be standing on, and I am confident people will back us on that platform.\"\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party leader said the election would be an opportunity to vote for representatives with a \"long-term vision\" for Northern Ireland.\n\nDoug Beattie said: \"It's time we had strategic thinkers in Westminster, pro-union MPs who can look beyond short-term goals and concentrate on a long-term vision for Northern Ireland.\"\n\nElsewhere, Colum Eastwood said the SDLP's \"mission\" is to remove the Tories from power, adding: \"It's time to reverse the toxic legacy bill, it's time to restore faith in the power of government as a force for good - it is fundamentally time for change.\"\n\nThe party leader said: \"The

The Westminster election on July 4 is an opportunity to send a clear message. That you want decisions about your life and your future to be made here in Ireland, and not in London.\"\n\nTaking aim at the controversial Legacy Act, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood criticised the Tories' record in Northern Ireland, saying they had caused 'chaos, pain and turmoil' during their time in power.\n\n\"It has taken 14 years but I've finally found something that I agree with this Tory government on -- it is time for an election,\" he said.\n\n\"People will now have an opportunity to cast their verdict on not just the last five years of chaos, pain and turmoil but the last 14 years of government that has left communities across Northern Ireland far worse off.\n\n\"The mission of the next six weeks could not be clearer -- it's time to remove the Tory government from power and install a new administration that understands the value of investing in public services and communities that have been left behind.\n\n\"It's time to reverse the toxic Legacy Bill, it's time to restore faith in the power of government as a force for good.\"\n\nHis words were echoed by Alliance leader Naomi Long, who said: \"We welcome the announcement of a General Election.\n\n\"It has been a long time coming and finally presents a real opportunity for people to remove the failing Conservative Government from power.\"\n\nReaction to the announcement from unionist parties focussed primarily on the future of the union.\n\nThe DUP supported a minority Conservative government with a confidence-and-supply agreement after the 2017 General Election.\n\nHowever, former leader Jeffrey Donaldson's Safeguarding the Union deal with the government earlier this year is not believed to have been met with universal acclaim within the party.\n\nInterim DUP leader Gavin Robinson said whichever party was in power after the election must work to strengthen the union.\n\n\"It has been clear for some time that this Government is fast running out of steam,\" said interim DUP leader Gavin Robinson.\n\n\"The General Election will provide the people of Northern Ireland with a clear choice as to who they think is best placed to represent them and deliver the best outcomes for them.\n\n\"While political progress and new mechanisms were secured in negotiations with the Conservative Government to allow the Assembly and Executive to be re-established the next Government will have much more to do to ensure Northern Ireland benefits as an integral part of the United Kingdom rather than remaining subject to European laws in some areas of our daily lives.\"\n\nIn its statement, the TUV -- which has formed an electoral pack with Reform UK -- appeared to take issue with the aforementioned deal, which saw power-sharing return to Stormont.\n\n\"TUV welcomes today's announcement of a general election,\" said leader Jim Allister.\n\n\"Having run away from debating the issues, there will be no place for those who embraced the division of the United Kingdom by returning to Stormont as Protocol implementors to hide now that the issues go to the people.\n\n\"This election will be a battle between those who believe in the unity of the UK and those who believe Northern Ireland can be treated as part of the EU.\"\n\nMeanwhile, UUP leader Doug Beattie stated: \"Here in Northern Ireland, we have a clear choice, carry on as before or set the conditions for a change.\n\n\"We need less pessimism, negativity and isolationism, less angry voices, less confrontation.\n\n\"We need representatives in Westminster who can stand up and make the case for Northern

It has already made the pitch - a reference to Sinn F\u00e9in's policy of abstention - that voters should back candidates who are \"ready to turn up\".\n\nRemember also that Sinn F\u00e9in is the only one of the Northern parties simultaneously facing elections in two jurisdictions - the local and European in the South, and Westminster in the North; while not ideal, it will calculate that it has sufficient resources that it can pull out all the stops in the Republic in advance of June 7th, then focus on Northern Ireland for the last four weeks of the Westminster campaign.\n\nFor the DUP's part, it will also want to keep its eight seats, and knows it is facing battles in a number of constituencies, not least in east Belfast, where its leader, Gavin Robinson, is the current MP, and in Lagan Valley, where the former leader Jeffrey Donaldson - who stood down after he was charged with historical sexual offences - remains the MP.\n\nHere, the scheduling will not favour the DUP; the party would no doubt have liked more time to allow the controversy to fade from the minds of the voting public; in court earlier on Wednesday, a date for his committal hearing was set for July 3rd - the day before polling day.\n\nIndeed, it was only on Wednesday that Donaldson's solicitor, John McBurney, speaking to RT\u00c9 outside the court, confirmed his client would not seek re-election but intended to continue as an MP in order to see to \"various\" constituency and administrative matters.\n\nIt is not yet clear who will replace Donaldson. The Minister for Communities, the DUP MLA Gordon Lyons, said the party had not yet selected all its candidates and would make an announcement in \"due course\"; whoever gets the nod, Alliance's Sorcha Eastwood will fancy her chances.\n\nMeanwhile, the UUP will be keen to get back on the scorecard, where their best chance may be in South Antrim, where the Minister for Health, Robin Swann, is to stand, presumably against the incumbent, the DUP's Paul Girvan.\n\nNorthern politics has enjoyed a rare period of calm since the restoration of the Assembly and Executive after a two-year hiatus in February; whether this can continue amid the cut-and-thrust of an election campaign remains to be seen.\n\nYet among those who had their statements ready and waiting to be issued on Wednesday evening, there was a rare moment of unanimity.\n\n\"It has been clear for some time that this [UK] government is fast running out of steam,\" said the DUP leader, Gavin Robinson.\n\n\"It has taken 14 years but I've finally found something that I agree with this Tory government on - it is time for an election,\" was the take by the SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood.\n\nA general election, said the Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"has been a long time coming and finally presents a real opportunity for people to remove the failing Conservative government from power\".\n\nPolitical parties, all on the same page?

election", "body": "Northern Ireland's two main parties go into the General Election on the back of starkly contrasting fortunes.\n\nFor Sinn Fein the poll represents the chance to solidify its recently assumed status as the largest party in the region, after displacing the DUP in top spot in both Assembly and local government elections over the past two years.\n\nMichelle O'Neill became Northern Ireland's first ever nationalist First Minister in February when devolution returned to Stormont after a two-year hiatus and the party's vice president will be hoping to take that momentum into the July election.\n\nIf Sinn Fein enter the campaign in confident mood, there will be nervousness within the DUP hierarchy as to how unionist voters will react to its decision to drop its boycott on powersharing at Stormont, and to the recent political earthquake that saw former leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson quit in March after he was charged with a series of historical sexual offences - charges he denies.\n\nThe DUP had blockaded Stormont for two years in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements that have created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nSir Jeffrey led the party back to Stormont earlier this year after accepting a Government deal that pledged to reduce Brexit red tape on Irish Sea trade.\n\nWhile opinion polls have shown a majority of DUP supporters backed the move, a sizeable minority of members believe the deal was oversold and the party relinquished its leverage with little to show for it.\n\nSenior party figures such as Lord Dodds and East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson have openly criticised the deal while external opponents within the wider unionist/loyalist community have been equally vocal.\n\nOne of the party's most vociferous detractors, the Traditional Unionist Voice, may be unlikely to win any seats at the election, but it could still inflict damage if unhappy DUP voters switch allegiances in protest at the ongoing existence of the so-called Irish Sea border.\n\nA further dynamic is provided by Reform UK's recent electoral link-up with the TUV.\n\nAnother trend that has been marked in elections in Northern Ireland in recent years is the growth of the middle ground vote that seemingly eschews the traditional orange and green divide.\n\nThis has manifested in a surge in support enjoyed by the cross-community Alliance Party.\n\nIt will hope to defend its seat in North Down and will be eyeing potential DUP scalps in places like Lagan Valley, where the criminal case against Sir Jeffrey will undoubtedly by a factor, and in East Belfast, the constituency of the man who has succeeded Sir Jeffrey as leader, Gavin Robinson.\n\nIt was confirmed on Wednesday that Sir Jeffrey will not be seeking re-election.\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party, the once preeminent force in Northern Ireland politics, goes into the election without any seats to defend.\n\nParty leader Doug Beattie will hope to secure a foothold back at Westminster, with South Antrim a key constituency target.\n\nThat contest will see UUP Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann, a politician widely praised during the Covid pandemic, move from his North Antrim hinterland in a bid to unseat the DUP's Paul Girvan.\n\nThe SDLP, whose recent electoral woes have seen it slip below the threshold for qualifying for a place in the Stormont executive, will hope to spark a long-awaited revival by holding its two Westminster seats, which are currently held by party leader Colum Eastwood and Claire Hanna.", "source": {"uri":

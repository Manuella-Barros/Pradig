A native of Flint, Michigan, Young was picked up 17th overall out of the University of Kentucky in the NBA draft of that same year.\n\nHe would spend much of his time playing for the Maine Red Claws (now, Celtics) in the NBA D League (as the G League was still known then) in his inaugural season after missing Summer League due to injuries. Young would play for Boston for a total of three seasons, but could never quite find his footing in the NBA, despite abundant patience from the front office.\n\nThe Kentucky product averaged 2.3 points and 1.1 rebounds in his time in green and white.\n\nIt is also the date that ex-Boston big man Jermaine O'Neal signed with the Celtics in 2010 after a career playing for the Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat, and Toronto Raptors.\n\nBrought on to try to ease the burden on Boston's aging, oft-injured frontcourt, O'Neal himself spent many games tending to minor injuries and only played 49 games for the team over two seasons.\n\nHe would log 5.2 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game with the Celtics.\n\nIt is the anniversary of the 2014 three-team trade that sent former Celtics center Tyler Zeller to Boston from the Cleveland Cavaliers along with Marcus Thornton from the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nBoston got the North Carolina product for the use of their cap space to roster him as the Cavs juggled players in an effort to assemble a championship-caliber team around LeBron James.\n\nZeller would play three seasons for the team, putting up 7.1 points, 4 boards, and an assist while with the Celtics.\n\nToday is also the birthday of Boston wing Johnny Bach, who played 34 games for the team in the 1948-49 season, averaging 3.5 points per game over that period.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York in 1924, he was a product of Fordham who was picked up by the Celtics in the second round of the Basketball Association of America (BAA - a precursor league to the NBA) and would return to head coach his alma mater in 1950 soon after retiring as a player.\n\nFinally, it is also the date we lost forward Al Brightman in 1992. The Charleston product played 58 contests with the Celtics in the team's inaugural season, averaging 9.8 points and 1.0 assists per game over that stretch.\n\nLike Bach, Brightman would go into coaching soon after retiring from the game, coaching in a number of professional leagues and collegiately in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nRest in peace.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast

After 16 years of longing for their 18th banner, the Celtics steamrolled through the Eastern Conference and then the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals. But the only thing harder than getting to the top is staying on top, and the Celtics will need to have a smart, low-cost approach to free agency to round out a roster that very well could go back-to-back.\n\nLike many other championship contenders, the Celtics are way, way over the salary cap. Spotrac lists the Celtics as having about $205 million in total cap allocations, including cap holds, with the bulk of that being the active roster's salaries, which are at nearly $200 million by themselves. Only a handful of teams are projected to spend more than the Celtics this season -- the Minnesota Timberwolves and Phoenix Suns are the only two teams who currently have more than $200 million in active contracts -- and things will only get more expensive over the next few seasons.\n\nJaylen Brown's five-year, $285.4 million contract extension is kicking in this season, and Jrue Holiday's four-year, $134.4 million and Kristaps Porzingis's two-year, $60 million extensions also begin this year. Jayson Tatum's extension, which could be worth as much as $313.9 million over five years, will begin with the 2025-26 season. Additionally, the four-year, $118 million extension Derrick White signed last week will begin next year.\n\nBetween just the starting five -- Tatum, Brown, White, Holiday, and Porzingis -- the Celtics will be paying them this season $163.4 million, more than $20 million over the salary cap. When everyone's extensions officially begin next year, the Celtics will owe the five a combined $198.5 million if the salary cap increases by 10% next offseason.\n\nThat being said, the Celtics have a team built to contend for a championship again for the next few seasons. Boston won 64 games in the regular season this year and won all but three games in the postseason, putting them in exclusive company in terms of full-season dominance. So it would appear injuries and how well some of the team's oldest players age will be the deciding factor in just how long the Celtics' championship window is.\n\nAlthough the team's moves have been limited by the cap constraints, Boston's offseason has already been a success. With the last pick in the first round of the NBA Draft, the Celtics selected Creighton sharpshooter Baylor Scheierman, giving themselves another perimeter shooting threat off of the bench and a potential minutes replacement for Oshae Brissett, who declined his player option a few days before the draft.\n\nMost importantly, though, the Celtics have been able to lock up many of their rotation players for at least the next season. In addition to signing Tatum and White to long-term extensions, the Celtics exercised their $2.1 million team option on Sam Hauser and signed reserve big men Luke Kornet ($2.1 million for one year) and Xavier Tillman ($4.8 million over two years) to short-term, low-priced deals to keep them around.\n\nWith all of the small, important moves Brad Stevens and the Celtics front office have made, the C's have locked up all but one active roster spot and one two-way player just a week and a half into July. So which player could fit the best in that final Boston active roster spot?\n\nCeltics' biggest offseason need: Another big man\n\nSince the Celtics are set to pay about $200 million in salaries this season, they are above the second tax apron, which is set at $188.9 million, and are thus subject to a few penalties. The most important restrictions to contending teams like Boston are 1) the team cannot take back any more salary than it is sending out in a trade and 2) the team cannot trade more than one player at a time. These limitations mean that any trades the Celtics do will likely be small, with very little money (relatively) coming in and going out.\n\nFortunately, the Celtics are in a great position; they have all of their rotation players under contract for this upcoming season and own five of their first-round picks over the next seven years. Therefore, the last noteworthy move the Celtics likely will and should make this offseason is signing a veteran to a minimum contract. And while the Celtics could go a few different ways with that, they should sign another big man to complete their roster.\n\nWhile Jaden Springer, who will earn $4 million this season and become a restricted free agent next year, may ultimately be replaced as the Celtics' final guard at some point this season, Boston needs a big man more than anything else at this point. Kristaps Porzingis, who battled through injuries during the playoffs, underwent surgery to repair a torn retinaculum and dislocated posterior tibialis tendon, an injury the team described as \"rare\" in the NBA Finals.\n\nPorzingis is expected to \"return to play in 5-6 months,\" according to the Celtics following his surgery late last month. Five months from then would mean Porzingis returns in late October, right around the start of the season. Six months means late November, a little over a month into the regular season and, if the schedule remains the same from last season, near the end of the second annual NBA Cup (formerly the In-Season Tournament).\n\nIf the Celtics err on the side of caution with Porzingis, as it is expected they will, the 7-foot-3-inch Latvian could miss the first 10 to 20 games of the regular season. And Porzingis has a lengthy injury history far preceding this latest procedure, so the Celtics will very likely try to 'load manage' the big man, which could result in him missing 15 to 25 additional games throughout the season after he returns.\n\nWhile the playoffs are the most important part of the NBA calendar for Boston, rolling out a roster with one fewer big man for a month only serves to put more stress and wear and tear on the other three: Luke Kornet, Xavier Tillman, and Al Horford. Of the three, Horford is the best and most important player, having started about half of the games he played last season and averaging 8.6 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in 26.8 minutes per game. However, Horford is also the Celtics' oldest player; he turned 38 years old last month. So while he could likely handle a few more minutes per game for a a small stretch of the season, it is a risk to do that with a player as valuable as Horford.\n\nAdditionally, neither Kornet, who cannot stretch the floor (despite making his one attempt last season) nor 6-foot-8-inch Tillman, who is a poor shooter, is well-suited to fill the Porzingis-sized hole he leaves behind. Last season, they each averaged fewer than 16 minutes per game, which is probably a fine figure for both, although Tillman could see his playing time increase back to nearly 20 minutes per game, where it was with the Memphis Grizzlies, if needed.\n\nThe Celtics could also decide to give fourth-year center Neemias Queta more minutes in Porzingis's absence. Queta led the team last season in rebounds per 36 (13.2) and was just behind Porzingis in blocks per 36 (2.3), but he is limited offensively and prone to fouling (5.4 fouls per 36).\n\nWhile increasing the minutes of each of the four existing Celtics big men, it would serve the Celtics well to sign a free-agent big man soon. While no minimum-contract player is without flaws or a perfect replacement for a player as talented and unique as Porzingis, there are a few options this offseason for Boston.\n\nIf the Celtics are determined to sign someone who can stretch the floor (albeit not incredibly well consistently), they could reunite with Mike Muscala, who played with the team for 20 regular-season games and six playoff games last year after being traded to Boston by the Oklahoma City Thunder. Over the last two seasons, during which he has played for four different teams, 6-foot-10-inch Muscala is shooting 36.0% from three on 7.1 attempts per 36.\n\nAnother stretch 4/5 option is Sandro Mamukelashvili, who began his career with the Milwaukee Bucks and played parts of the last two seasons with the San Antonio Spurs. Mamukelashvili has shot 30.1% from three on 5.3 attempts per 36 over the past two seasons, but he has shown flashes of better shooting in the past. He also had 11.7 rebounds per 36 last season, the third-highest on the Spurs.\n\nPast those two, the options to add another shooting big man are relatively limited. Micah Potter, a 6-foot-10-inch big man, has very, very few NBA games under his belt (26 over three seasons), but he would fit the archetype as well. In the G League, he is a career 40.5% three-point shooter on 5.1 attempts per 36 and averaged 15.5 points, 9.0 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.6 blocks with the Salt Lake City Stars last regular season and played even better (16.6 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.1 blocks, 44.2% 3PT) in the G League Winter Showcase.\n\nIf Chimezie Metu does not receive a better offer in free agency, he could also be a potential fit for the Celtics despite his shooting woes (28.0% 3PT the last two seasons). Metu played for the Phoenix Suns and Detroit Pistons last season, and in a bigger role with the Pistons, he averaged 10.5 points, 6.0 rebounds, 1.9 assists, and 1.7 steals per game.\n\nOther big-man options include 7-foot Omer Yurtseven, who played for the Utah Jazz last year after two seasons with the Miami Heat and averaged 14.7 points and 13.7 rebounds per 36 last season; Damian Jones (12.0 points, 8.9 rebounds, 1.6 blocks per 36 the last two seasons), and Orlando Robinson (10.6 points, 10.4 rebounds, 2.9 assists per 36 in Miami the last two years).", "source": {"uri":

A standout at the University of Florida, where the Dominican center won two national titles in consecutive seasons, Horford was drafted third overall by the Atlanta Hawks, with whom he spent nine seasons before choosing to sign with the Celtics.\n\nThe former Gator left Atlanta in free agency after the Hawks were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the playoffs two years in a row. He signed a four-year, $113 million contract with Boston. The Celtics made the Eastern Conference finals twice during Horford's first tenure with the team.\n\nThe Puerto Plata native also made an All-Star team and an All-Defensive second team while with Boston in that stint.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2018-19 season with the team that saw a number of factors destroy a highly anticipated campaign, Horford opted to test the free market.\n\nThe Boston star was tendered a considerable offer by the Philadelphia 76ers that the Celtics did not match. They later traded assets to get him back on their cap sheet -- more on that shortly.\n\nHorford struggled in an over-packed Sixers frontcourt and was dealt to the Oklahoma City Thunder the following offseason. He rebuilt his reputation as one of the league's most complete big men, only to be dealt back to Boston at the end of the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nHe was an instrumental part of the team's run to the 2022 NBA Finals.\n\nIt was also on this date in 2009 that four-time All-Star Rasheed Wallace signed with the Celtics.\n\nThe former UNC standout played one season with Boston before retiring for two seasons. He averaged 9 points, 4.1 boards, an assist, and a steal per game.\n\nIt was on this date the Celtics lost wing Earl Shannon in 2002.\n\nThe Rhode Island native (who went on to become an FBI agent after his basketball career) played five games for Boston in the 1948-49 season before retiring.\n\nHe averaged 1 point per game over that stretch -- rest in peace.\n\n1950: Frank Ramsey #23 of the Boston Celtics dribbles for a mock action portrait circa 1950's.

This comes just a few weeks before the team heads to Paris for the 2024 Olympics.\n\nLeonard stepped away from the team Wednesday morning, saying he wanted to focus on preparing for next year. Leonard dealt with a lingering knee injury with the Clippers during the 2023-24 season. In joining team USA, White will reunite with his Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday. The All-Defensive guard has a history with the program, and was a finalist to make the Olympic team back in 2020. White was also a member of the USA World Cup squad that went 6-2 in 2019. This past season with the Celtics, his unique blend of defense and scoring was a key component for Boston's title run. No doubt he will be providing similar services to a Team USA eager to win another gold medal.\n\nAt the time of this writing, it's unclear when White will report. Team USA will play five showcase games prior to the Olympics proper in Las Vegas, London, and Abu Dhabi beginning on July 10.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nHow do the new-look Mavs stack up against the Boston Celtics?

From the results, capturing Banner 18 in Boston and reaching the G League Finals in Maine to team chemistry and a work environment they repeatedly raved about, the organization wants to preserve as much of what it had last season.\n\nTheir latest step in working toward that goal is re-signing JD Davison to his third two-way deal with the franchise. Following the draft's conclusion, the Celtics' president of basketball operations, Brad Stevens, stated, \"JD will be a free agent, but we very much (would) like to try to figure out a way to get him back in (some) capacity.\"\n\nHe joins Drew Peterson, who Boston re-signed last week, occupying two of the team's three two-way slots. The other may go to Celtics' second-round selection in this year's draft, Anton Watson.\n\nDavison appeared in eight games with the parent club in the 2023-24 campaign. He also starred in the G League, where he averaged 22.7 points, 8.4 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.1 steals per game. That earned him a spot on the All-NBA G League Third Team.\n\nOn Monday at the Auerbach Center, Celtics' assistant general manager Austin Ainge expressed, \"JD came out very young in the draft, and the last two years in Maine, he's improved and improved, and we've loved his trajectory and think he still has room to grow. He's younger than the guys we just drafted and a lot of other guys that were drafted, and (we) think he still has some (room for) growth.

He noted how the trio of George, Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey was as potent as they were talented.\n\nNevertheless, Philadelphia isn't the only team in the East that has improved. The New York Knicks' addition of Mikal Bridges has drastically improved their versatility on both ends of the floor. As such, the Celtics have two legitimate threats heading into the new season.\n\nYou can hear Perkins' full comments by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3UAVYRg\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3y0H4Lh\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nCan the Boston Celtics latest draft picks earn real minutes next season?

Former Iowa Hawkeye Tyler Cook isn't just an athletic forward who could give Boston some physicality in Las Vegas. Cook is also former high school teammates with All-NBA forward Jayson Tatum. The two played together at Chaminade College Preparatory School in Creve Coeur, Missouri, and Cook and Tatum helped lead the team to a state title as seniors in 2016. The duo have been reunited by the Celtics, however briefly, and Cook has a shot at rejoining his old teammate if he can impress in Las Vegas enough to earn a contract with Boston.\n\nCeltics assistant general manager Austin Ainge spoke about what he hopes to see from Cook at summer league at a press conference held at the team's practice facility in Boston Monday afternoon.\n\nAinge told Celtics Wire that the Celtics targeted Cook because of his unique blend of size and skill. There are a number of players on the roster with Cook's build, but hopefully he can stand out with his touch.\n\n\"He's physical,\" Ainge explained. \"He handles the ball very well for a big.\"\n\nCook, 26, is listed as 6-foot-9 and has a strong build. During his three seasons with Iowa, he averaged 6.7 rebounds per game, and was a solid offensive player, too.\n\nShooting is not his forte, however, and so he will likely need to really impress on the glass in Las Vegas to land a spot with a team like the Celtics.\n\nAinge outlined that summer league is designed for players and teams to try and identify that potential for a mutually beneficial relationship. Many of the players will earn second looks either elsewhere in the NBA or the G League.\n\n\"With all these guys,\" Ainge said. \"We're just trying to see, how can you help the Celtics? How can you help a team win? And our coaching staff is working hard to put them in those situations.\"\n\nCook is no stranger to those trials. He went undrafted in 2019, and has had several brief stints around the NBA and G League. He even logged very limited postseason burn with the Denver Nuggets in 2020 as a deep bench player.\n\nMore recently, Cook played professionally in Australia and with Club Joventut Badolona in Spain. As such, the unknowns that come with playing for an NBA team's summer league roster should not be unfamiliar.\n\nWhether or not Cook lands with the Celtics is unclear. It's extremely unlikely he joins Boston, but a strong showing in Las Vegas could be beneficial for getting a deal with the Maine Celtics, the team's G League affiliate.\n\nFor now, another trip to Vegas is a stop for Cook on his basketball journey, and one that could loosely reunite him with Tatum. Summer league starts this Saturday (July 13) for the Celtics.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube:

However, after not getting much playing time with the Sun Devils, he transferred over to the University of New Mexico. They Lobos put Jaelen in a much bigger role than than the Sun Devils did.\n\nNot only did House appear in more games, going from 21 to 31, but his minutes per game average also went up. He went from averaging 18.7 minutes a game to 32.2 minutes a game with the Lobos. Jaelen played five years at the collegiate level combined with Arizona State and the University of New Mexico.\n\nWhen it was all said and done, Jaelen averaged 12.3 points, 3.2 assists, and 3.1 rebounds. He also shot 39.4% from the field and 33.8% from three-point land. He was also a three-time All-Mountain West selection and the league's Defensive Player of the Year in his last season with the Lobos.\n\nAfter he finished college, he received invites to the NBA Draft Combine and G-League Elite Camp.\n\nEven though he's Eddie House's son, Jaelen has some impressive accolades to his name.\n\nEddie only played for the Celtics for two-and-a-half seasons from 2007 to 2010, but he left an impression with fans. He became a fan favorite in Boston because of his ability to make threes at a high rate. His floor-spacing helped the Celtics immensely in two of their playoff runs in 2008 and 2009.\n\nHouse helped the Celtics win their 17th title as a franchise in 2008. Had Kevin Garnett not gotten hurt the next season, he may have helped them win their 18th as well in 2009.\n\nThe Celtics traded him to the New York Knicks mid-season in 2010 when House was not playing as well as he did in his first two seasons in Boston. When he returned to Boston for the first time since the trade, Celtics fans applauded him, showing their appreciation for his efforts.\n\nSince his playing days ended in 2011, House has worked as an analyst for NBC Sports Boston. House worked alongside former teammate and fellow Celtics champion Brian Scalabrine. Even though his time in Boston wasn't long, he clearly still has an attachment to the Celtics.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_john@heavy.com", "name": "Matt John", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_House", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Lobos", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico Lobos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neemias_Queta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neemias Queta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baylor University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of New Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alma mater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Draft_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Draft Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Scalabrine", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Scalabrine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2089820655-e1720457837429.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The road to his first title included five Eastern Conference Finals appearances and two trips to the NBA Finals.\n\nVarious skeptics negatively perceived the long term playoff success of Tatum's Boston Celtics, as they hadn't yet reached the ultimate goal. As captured by The Old Man and The Three, Tatum gave his thoughts on the doubters who believed the Celtics' championship window had closed.\n\n\"People would have that narrative 'They're not going to do it. They're too young. They can't figure it out'. To me, that's like sustained success. It was like, it's a matter of time until we do it. That's how we looked at it as a unit. When you have success early, they just think you're so much older than you are. There was so much talk of our window being closed. I just turned 26. Jaylen Brown is 27. They say that you don't reach your prime until you're 28.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Tatum was named the male cover athlete for NBA 2K25.

Boston released its final roster for the NBA 2K25 Summer League in Las Vegas, and the Summer Celtics are officially stacked.\n\nBoston's summer squad is loaded with talent, headlined by many players from the actual Celtics roster. Here are the recent Banner 18 winners who will play for the Celtics this summer:\n\nWalsh, Springer, and Queta all have standard contracts with the Celtics. Meanwhile, Davison and Peterson both resigned two-way deals this offseason. Davison will enter a rare third consecutive season on a two-way contract with the same team. Clearly, the Celtics still see something in the young point guard who lit up the G League last season.\n\nNot many Summer League teams possess the kind of NBA experience the Celtics will boast in July. Fans should expect to see Walsh get heavy minutes as Boston tries to transform the defensively gifted 20-year-old into a real two-way threat. If he improves his jumper, Walsh can fit right in as a 3-and-D role player to complement stars like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.\n\nThe rest of Boston's summer league roster looks like this:\n\nScheierman and Watson stand out as Boston's 2024 draft picks. Picked No. 30 in this year's draft, Scheierman may be the most exciting piece of the puzzle for the Summer Celtics. The versatile forward played five years of college basketball, fine-tuning his skills to enter the league as one of the most NBA-ready prospects out there.\n\nScheierman has an elite shooting stroke with a 39.0% 3-point clip for his college career. He also has a well-rounded skill set and a knack for contributing in multiple areas of the game. The former Creighton star made NCAA history as the only Division I player to ever record career totals of 2000 points, 1000 rebounds, 500 assists, and 300 threes.\n\nFellow rookie Watson went to the Celtics with the No. 54 pick, and the Gonzaga product has already built some chemistry with Scheierman. Like Scheierman, Watson played for all five years in college. He won an incredible 130 out of his 149 games with Gonzaga. Both rookies also grew up as Red Sox fans, per Taylor Snow.\n\nScheierman talked to Boston media about his rookie connection with Watson and how their similar collegiate experiences have made them even closer.\n\n\"We're kind of the same age, we've been in college for a few years ... Just to have someone else going through the same things you are, to obviously be there to talk about really anything ... it's nice and it means a lot.\"\n\nScheierman makes it six total Summer Leaguers who currently have spots on the 2024-25 Celtics roster. Watson will look to make it seven by signing what would likely be a two-way deal with Boston.\n\nIn his most recent press conference, Watson said getting drafted by the Celtics was the \"best day of my life.\" The athletic forward has the defensive build and IQ to guard multiple positions, and he shot 41.2% from downtown in his final year of college.\n\nThe Summer Celtics have added two young hoopers with \"championship DNA\" in the most technical sense of the phrase. Harper Jr. is the son of five-time NBA champion Ron Harper, best known for running point next to the great Michael Jordan. House's father is Eddie House, who won the 2008 title with the Celtics and is now a well-respected basketball analyst.\n\nHarper Jr. has spent the first two years of his NBA career on two-way deals with the Toronto Raptors. The 24-year-old averaged 17.3 points in the G League two seasons ago, also averaging 1.2 blocks and one steal while shooting 50.1% from the field. Last year, he only played one game before he had to get season-ending shoulder surgery.\n\nWhen healthy, Harper Jr. has flashed some serious promise. He stands at 6-foot-6 with solid playmaking skills that developed during his first G League season, and he has a high defensive motor. Harper Jr. can play multiple positions on the wing due to his athleticism and versatility.\n\nHouse went undrafted after playing five years of college ball for Arizona State and New Mexico. His 15.9 points per game as a super-senior were tarnished by a subpar 37.4% clip from the field, but Eddie's son has turned some heads so far in Las Vegas.\n\nHouse received a huge compliment from Scheierman in regard to his drive and work ethic. Scheierman called House the most competitive player - aside from himself - at Summer League training camp.\n\nThe Celtics will begin their Summer League on July 13 against the Miami Heat. They will play three more games from July 15-19, including matchups with the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nGiven the experienced nature of Boston's talented roster, C's fans should expect a sizzling Summer League from the reigning champs.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They were 64-18 during the regular season and lost just three times in the playoffs. No series even made it to six games. Boston had made several deep runs since 2017 and finally got over the hump as Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are entering their primes.\n\nThe Celtics could have taken a step back after winning it all, but decided to keep spending. They were not deterred by the new second tax apron and the roster restrictions that come with it. Boston believes they can win another championship and it meant making a serious financial commitment.\n\nThe Celtics will be favorites to repeat, and Tatum is eager to win more championships. Boston has their entire core locked up for at least two more years and even added a rookie who should be ready to contribute immediately. They are elite and only one thing can derail them.\n\nWinning back-to-back championships is difficult. Many thought the Nuggets would repeat after their 2023 title, but Denver was bounced in the second round of the playoffs. No team has repeated since the Warriors in 2017 and 2018. Since 2000, only the Lakers (three times), Heat, and Warriors have won back-to-back.\n\nThe Celtics return their top 11 in minutes per game from last season with Al Horford and Jrue Holiday as the only players over 30 years old. Boston added Baylor Scheierman with the 30th overall pick. The five-year college player is an elite shooter with a versatile skill set and may see minutes off the bench immediately.\n\nBoston is arguably better, which leaves injuries as the only thing capable of stopping them. Kristaps Porzingis played in just seven of their 19 playoff contests, and the Celtics dominated their way to a championship. Other teams had injuries along the path, but that is part of the sport.\n\nFans will point to the improvements of the Knicks and 76ers as potential challenges for the Celtics. The Eastern Conference will be better, but Boston has the best top six in the league and more depth than last season. It will take injuries to multiple top-end players for the franchise to be knocked off in the playoffs, especially with their top four scorers in their primes.\n\nBoston Celtics fans should be ecstatic. It was a slam dunk offseason where the franchise re-signed all their key pieces and added a talented rookie. They are serious about contending and not letting spending get in the way. The Celtics have a fantastic chance to repeat and only injuries can get in the way.\n\nBoston proved they were the best team and will hold that distinction next season. Credit to ownership and the front office for keeping this group together, and stay tuned to see if they can become the NBA's next dynasty. It won't be easy, but this squad is eager to face the challenge.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baylor University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6600,h_3712,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/18/01j29p77jeydzbdyqntx.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

KG left a message about Brown's body language on the bench looked, and what he ought to do about it. \"I can't say all the words because there was a lot of curse words in it,\" shared the Cal-Berkeley product. \"Like, 'Pick your (expletive) head up, right now.'\"\n\nIt evidently helped motivate Brown, who took it to heart, along with the respect he continues to have for the Big Ticket's game.\n\nWatch the clip embedded above to hear Brown's account of that message yourself -- we can almost hear KG shouting from here.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts:

The 13-man squad is a mix of experienced players, two of the newest members of the Celtics, and a handful of hopefuls looking to make it to the NBA.\n\nNeemias Queta, Jaden Springer, and Jordan Walsh are all on the Summer Celtics after spending time during the 2023-24 season with the NBA Champs. JD Davison is currently an unrestricted free agent but the 2022 second-round pick will be back on the team for a second straight summer as he looks to continue his development with Boston. Two-way player Drew Peterson, who played three games for the Celtics during the regular season, is also in the mix this summer.\n\nBut the highlight for Celtics fans will be Brad Stevens' two picks in the 2024 NBA Draft: Baylor Scheierman out of Creighton and Anton Watson out of Gonzaga. Both should get a decent amount of run in Las Vegas ahead of their rookie seasons.\n\nThere are also some interesting non-roster members of the Summer Celtics, including Jaelen House. The former New Mexico guard is the son of Eddie House, who was a key piece to Boston's 2008 championship team and is currently a Celtics TV analyst.\n\nTyler Cook is also on the roster, and will likely have a big fan in Jayson Tatum. Cook played with the C's superstar in high school at Chaminade College Prep in St. Louis, Missouri, before playing his college ball at Iowa. Cook bounced around the NBA from 2019-2022, and played last season for Joventut Badalona in Spain.\n\nTristan Enaruna (undrafted in 2024), Ron Harper Jr. (who played two seasons in the Raptors organization), Jahmi'us Ramsey (who played with the Raptors and in the G League in 2024), and Killian Tillie (who played two seasons in Memphis from 2020-2022) round out the roster for Boston. Harper Jr. has been in a few summer leagues, and along with the other non-roster players, could earn a spot in Maine with a strong showing in Las Vegas.\n\nBoston assistant coach D.J. MacLeay will serve as head coach in Las Vegas for the first time. The Summer Celtics will tip off their five-game slate on Saturday, July 13 against the Miami Heat at 6:30 p.m., followed by games against the Lakers (July 15), Hornets (July 17), and Mavericks (July 19) before either advancing to the four-team playoff or a consolation-round matchup.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's what that means.", "body": "In perhaps the least discouraging downside of all time, the Celtics have made themselves one of the worst Summer League destinations imaginable by filling out their entire roster with defending champions before their games in Las Vegas even began.\n\nWhen the dust settled and Xavier Tillman Sr. was inked to a two-year deal last week, the Celtics found themselves without any free two-way slots (welcome back to Drew Peterson and J.D. Davison, welcome to Anton Watson), and they have one free roster spot that they presumably will carry for a little while to maintain some modicum of flexibility.\n\nBut generally speaking, the Celtics' business for the 2024-25 season is done. They looked around contentedly at the faces in the locker room, got their work done quickly, and can rest easy the rest of the way this summer knowing their roster will be entirely intact.\n\nHere's a closer look at what that means for each player.\n\nJayson Tatum: The city of Boston tends to ingratiate itself to its best players, and Tatum is no exception. Less than two years ago, fans panicked when they saw him don Lakers colors to memorialize one of Kobe Bryant's greatest moments while saying \"I used to dream of this.\"\n\nNow, Tatum is speaking openly about his desire to stay in Boston for his entire career, soothing the nerves of any fan traumatized by Kyrie Irving.\n\nKyrie aside, Boston is still a wonderful place for a sports star to be embraced. All it asks is that you win and that you love it back. When you do the former, the latter becomes easy.\n\nWhere can Tatum go from here? Winning a championship is brutally hard, as the first seven years of his career proved. Already, he has to be mentioned in conversations that might make longtime Celtics fans balk. He hasn't surpassed Larry Bird or John Havlicek (and Bill Russell is out of the question) ... but has he surpassed Kevin Garnett? How far, realistically, is he from Paul Pierce?\n\nThe driving narrative of the first part of Tatum's career was his pursuit of a title. The next portion will be his pursuit of a permanent place in Celtics history -- the bitter rival of his longtime idol.\n\nLife's a funny thing, sometimes.\n\nJaylen Brown: Perhaps no one has done more to improve their NBA Q rating than Brown, who went from \"the star who can't dribble with his left\" to \"the star who can't dribble with his left who just signed the biggest contract in NBA history\" to \"Eastern Conference finals MVP\" to \"Finals MVP\" and \"champion.\"\n\nNot a bad run!\n\nBrown will enter next season in many of the same conversations as Tatum. After all, Kevin McHale is an all-time Celtics great. Havlicek played with Russell. Whichever of the Tatum/Brown combination you prefer, they are both headed for impressive spots in Celtics history before their careers are done, and they should be respectively the last players to wear \"0\" and \"7\" in Celtics history.\n\nKristaps Porzingis: In some ways, Porzingis finds himself in uncharted territory: He is now an NBA champion, he is on a team that has maximized him (in part, of course, because Porzingis has accepted a new role and in doing so has maximized himself), and he secured a place in Celtics lore by returning from injury and dominating Game 1 against the Mavericks.\n\nIn other ways, Porzingis is facing a very familiar foe. Injuries have limited him throughout his career, and they are once again the primary talking point behind his offseason.\n\nCan he come back healthy next year and participate in a playoff run? If so, the Celtics will be (or at least, should be) comfortably the favorites even if they don't secure the 1-seed in a beefed up Eastern Conference. If not, they are likely still the favorites, but as the hunted team (with two crucial players participating with Team USA this summer after deep playoff runs), the questions get a little louder as Al Horford gets a little older.\n\nJrue Holiday: Bucks fans will tell you over and over that Holiday struggled in the postseason, but never let a Celtics fan hear a bad word about him. Holiday steadied the ship when the Celtics needed it most and provided two-way contributions that Brad Stevens could only dream of when the Bucks emerged as Damian Lillard's destination last year.\n\nHoliday is a two-time All-Star and has almost nothing to prove, but he has shown the level to which he can elevate a team. On the Celtics, he is the ultimate crack-filler: Someone who can defend across the board, hit 3-pointers and handle the ball. His role won't change next year.\n\nOf course, he isn't the only crack-filler.\n\nDerrick White: White -- who of course is the other crack-filler -- will see almost no change to his role this season either. One of the reasons the Celtics are so good is because they have two stars, as well as two guards who can do any of the things the stars might struggle to do on any given night. That shouldn't change meaningfully this season.\n\nAl Horford: Horford wasted no time declaring his intention to return this season, silencing the people who prefer narrative (\"wouldn't it be nice to go out as a champion?\") to production (it would be wild for the starting center of an NBA champion -- who was one of the team's top on/off stars in the postseason -- to call it quits at this stage).\n\nHow much does Horford realistically have left? He has taken care of his body throughout his career, and his game lends itself to old age, but he does seem to struggle a bit with longer minutes at this stage, and Porzingis will miss a lot of time. The Celtics also may need him to deal with Joel Embiid in the playoffs, since the Sixers are now a more potent opponent.\n\nHorford is more than just the Team Dad - he's a high-level contributor who still has quite a bit in the tank. How much \"quite a bit\" might prove to be could be an important part of this season.\n\nSam Hauser: We know Hauser can shoot. Can he establish himself as an above-average defender this season?\n\nThat will be one of the key questions, and for Hauser, it could be an incredibly lucrative one. He defended Luka Doncic well at times on a Finals stage, and he seemed to be in position much of the time defensively, but other teams targeted him extensively. If he becomes above-average, he will become a very wealthy basketball player.\n\nPayton Pritchard: Pritchard's role increased, and it might do so again. If the Celtics need to scale back their super team over the next year or two, he could take on an outsized role.\n\nThe (sort of) bad news for Pritchard is that the Celtics certainly won't scale back this season. They are in it for another championship, and they want their entire team back to chase it.\n\nThe good news for Pritchard, of course, is that he will make more than $23 million over the next three seasons, and if he remains in Boston, he will perennially contend for a title. Worse situations are certainly out there.\n\nLuke Kornet: Nobody likes a good bit more than Luke Kornet, and even his free agency was something of a joke. His presence could make Porzingis' absence much more tolerable. Can he ensure that Horford doesn't overwork himself from opening night until Porzingis' return?\n\nXavier Tillman Sr.: Xavier Tillman probably is not the Al Horford replacement. He's shorter, his defense isn't as versatile, he doesn't defend bigs as well, he did not win back-to-back titles in college, and he is not on a Hall of Fame track at this stage in his career.\n\nHe can capably switch onto multiple positions and defend the pick-and-roll.\n\nHe showed some flashes from the corners as a 3-point shooter.\n\nAnd he is a burly defender who could take a lot of good notes from Horford about defending some of the NBA's more physical behemoths.\n\nThe Celtics may have been wise getting a two-year look at him.\n\nNeemias Queta: Like Kornet, Queta should see a boost in his minutes this season with Porzingis out. He showed some real flashes during the Celtics' elite regular-season run. The first two months of the season could be one of Queta's biggest opportunities so far.\n\nJordan Walsh: Can Walsh be an NBA player this year? By all accounts, his time in Maine was a success, but the NBA is a completely different animal, and Walsh will need to be very productive to earn even spot minutes on a contender. Another developmental season would be fine ... but the clock is ticking.\n\nBaylor Scheierman: Scheierman's highlight reel will have Celtics fans dreaming. Watching NBA talent attack him defensively might be a wake-up call, but if Scheierman shows flashes on that end, he might raise some eyebrows.\n\nA lot of the eyebrows he raises this season are likely to be in Las Vegas and Portland, Maine, however.\n\nJaden Springer: Springer is still a very interesting player, but the Celtics' guard depth is no joke. Can he break through and demand minutes?\n\nJ.D. Davison: The Celtics have made noise about loving Davison's \"trajectory,\" which is presumably why they were willing to use yet another two-way slot on him. He's an undeniable athlete and an intriguing distributor. Getting any kind of NBA run will require a huge leap, however, since he not only needs to prove he belongs - he also needs to jump players like Springer.\n\nDrew Peterson: Peterson was a do-everything wing/forward in college, which becomes more difficult at the professional level where most teams need most players to really do one or two things at an elite level (and defend). A second look at how he develops makes sense, but he might be even more buried than Davison with the arrival of Scheierman.\n\nAnton Watson: Can Watson shoot 3s at a decent clip in Las Vegas? He's a versatile defender with a real shot at an NBA career if his shooting in his final year at Gonzaga is real. He will spend a lot of time in Maine, but of the two-way guys, his path to the regular roster might be the clearest.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"},

I love this team that I'm on. This is a hell of a team (with) some of the best players to ever play. But what I just went through with my teammates in winning a championship, we're locked in forever. I'm taking us against whoever.\"\n\nBoston was, by far, the best team in the NBA this past season, totaling a league-leading 64 wins in the regular season followed by a 16-3 run in the playoffs en route to Banner 18. The Celtics never collided with a notable cold skit, stuck by their identity and didn't allow injuries to derail them. When starting center Kristaps Porzingis suffered a left leg injury in the first round of the postseason, Boston responded by going 10-2 without the 7-footer.\n\nWhether or not the Celtics are a \"super team\" is up for debate, but the numbers don't lie and when the 2023-24 season opened in October and ended in June, nobody stood taller than Boston. No team in NBA history recorded as many 50-point wins, 40-point wins, 30-point wins and 25-point wins as the Celtics, nor did anyone else secure a record-setting 18th Larry O'Brien Trophy.\n\nBut just because it's summertime and the streets of Boston are cleared of any celebratory confetti from the duck boat parade doesn't mean Tatum's escaped the pressure of top-of-the-line expectations, even if means not playing for the Celtics.\n\nIt's been 12 years since James last played for Team USA and the now-39-year-old's commitment sparked an outpour of interest from the NBA's brightest stars -- including Tatum's. Assembling that kind of powerhouse roster, consisting of 12 All-Stars and seven NBA champions hasn't been the norm for the last decade-plus, therefore, Team USA -- just like the Celtics -- will be expected to live up to their hype once the festivities commence.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/Boston-Celtics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

It was the first Celtics title in 16 seasons, and fans flocked to the team's championship parade by the millions to party in the streets a few days later.\n\nOne fan in particular breathed a sigh of relief. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is a die-hard Celtics fan, and she and her entire family were rooting as hard as anyone else in the Hub for their team to clinch a coveted 18th banner. Wu has been in Boston since college, and has served as the city's mayor since 2021. She knows how important the Celtics are to Boston and the surrounding area, and how heartbreaking previous season's had been for fans. By securing a title, the team had put to bed years of doubt and earned a chance to memorialize the achievement with a traditional duck boat parade as well.\n\nCeltics Wire spoke with Mayor Wu about the parade, rooting for the Celtics throughout the 2024 postseason, and what the organization means to the city of Boston.\n\n\"The parade was amazing,\" Wu told Celtics Wire. \"We had incredible turnout, and so much love. Every generation came out, every part of our community.\"\n\nWu joined Celtics rookies Baylor Scheierman and Anton Watson at a basketball at the city's historical Tobin Community Center, operated by Boston Centers for Youth and Families. Wu continued to beam about the parade, saying it was a snapshot of a much larger connection between the region and the team.\n\n\"The parade just really reflected how much this team means to our larger community,\" Wu explained. \"Not just on the court, but as you see here today, they're involved every single day of the year.\"\n\n\"The Celtics came together as a team to really show just what sacrifice means, Wu added. \"What it means to be there for your team, and to make sure that you were helping contribute to everyone else's success. And that was such a powerful example for my kids, for all of our young people, and for the city to see. Not just that they did it, but how they did it as well.\"\n\nWu and the city work closely with the Celtics on a number of projects and events throughout the year. When asked about planning the parade, Wu joked about balancing her fandom and her civic responsibilities.\n\n\"I am superstitious,\" Wu laughed. \"I try to set healthy boundaries as a sports fan.\"\n\n\"So, I think we started conversations with the team in a very provisional way in advance,\" Wu said. \"It was still part way through the series before we were kind of concrete about our plans.\"\n\nScheierman and Watson joined Celtics champion Leon Powe in dribbling drills and other games with a few dozen young people from the community. Wu watched from the sideline, chatting with players, parents, and other people at the event. She spoke about how important little moments like these can be.\n\n\"You can't quantify how much this means to the city,\" Wu said. \"We have community centers where the courts have been redone because of the generosity and involvement of the team. We have science labs in some of these buildings where the Celtics have come in and helped, and we've had events that they've sponsored that are creating lifelong memories for young people.\"\n\n\"These kids will never forget that they got to dribble alongside champions,\" Wu added.\n\nWu's own children are fans of the team, and she talked about the experience of watching games during the playoffs with her family. Like many fans, the Wu family had certain rules and rituals during the postseason and especially the finals.\n\n\"There was a lot of popcorn,\" Wu joked. \"A lot of yelling, and a lot of 'If you did this, and they went on a run, you have got to stay on that spot on the couch, you can't move.' We all tried our hardest to contribute as well from home.\"\n\nWith the confetti all cleaned up and the NBA offseason in full swing, the Celtics are already looking ahead to next season. Despite any superstition, Wu said she and her family are ready to root for the team as they look to defend their title.\n\n\"We are going to be cheering them on every single game,\" Wu said. \"I can't help but dream alongside the entire city and all of Celtics Nation.\"\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nBaylor Scheierman, Anton Watson coach local kids at Boston Celtics community event The Boston Celtics have a STACKED roster for Los Vegas Summer League Memphis Grizzlies get poor marks for their trade for Marcus Smart Shaq doesn't think the Boston Celtics will repeat Kevin Garnett weighs in on the start of a potential Boston Celtics dynasty", "source": {"uri": "celticswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celtics Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_tabatabaie@celticswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Cameron Tabatabaie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Wu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Wu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_Scheierman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baylor Scheierman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anton Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superstition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Powe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Powe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://celticswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2024/07/2158004979.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Oddsmakers, experts say no", "body": "The 76ers and Knicks have emerged as the Celtics' top competitors in the East, but the odds suggest Boston's still in a class of its own.\n\nSeveral players were on the move in the first week or so of free agency, with a pair of the Celtics' top rivals making big-time additions.\n\nThe 76ers added the biggest name in free agency, signing Paul George to a four-year, maximum deal to form an All-Star trio with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. They also added Caleb Martin, Eric Gordon, and Andre Drummond.\n\nIn between Philadelphia and Boston on I-95, the New York Knicks made their big splash prior to free agency. They acquired Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in a trade that cost the Knicks five first-round picks and a first-round pick swap.\n\nThose moves have led many to believe that the 76ers and Knicks are the top challengers to dethrone the Celtics in the Eastern Conference after their title-winning season. The Bucks, Pacers, Cavaliers, and Magic also loom, with Orlando making the only notable acquisition of the group so far in signing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.\n\nThe oddsmakers agree with the sentiment that Philadelphia and New York are Boston's top challengers, but there's still a notable gap between the Celtics and their rivals. The Knicks odds to win the title jumped from +1600 to +900 at BetMGM following their trade for Bridges. They currently sit at +950 on DraftKings Sportsbook. Meanwhile, the 76ers' title odds moved from +1400 to +800 and their odds to win the East went from +650 to +400 at BetMGM after signing George.\n\nAs the 76ers (+400) and Knicks (+450) hold the second- and third-best odds to win the East, the Celtics are ahead of the pack with +150 odds to win the conference on DraftKings Sportsbook as of Sunday. The Celtics' odds to win the conference have an implied probability of 40 percent and are similar to the odds they had to win the conference for much of last season.\n\nLooking beyond the East, a pair of Western Conference contenders made splashes this offseason as well. The Thunder traded for defensive standout Alex Caruso and signed center Isaiah Hartenstein. The Mavericks acquired Klay Thompson in a sign-and-trade to help their bid repeat as conference champs.\n\nBut neither team, or any other team in the West for that matter, bridged the gap with the Celtics in terms of title odds. As the 76ers have the second-best odds to win the title at +800, the Thunder and Nuggets are tied for the third-best title odds at +850 on DraftKings Sportsbook. The Mavericks (+1000) and Timberwolves (+1000) trail the Knicks for the fifth-best odds.\n\nMeanwhile, the Celtics have +290 odds to win the title at DraftKings. Those were the same odds they had to win the title entering the offseason, giving them an implied probability of roughly 25 percent. Boston's current title odds are similar to the odds it had to win last year's title during the All-Star break, when it was +260 to win it all. The Celtics finished the regular season with a 64-18 record, posting one of the best point differentials in league history before going 16-3 in the playoffs.\n\nMany analysts seem to agree with the prevailing thought that the Celtics remain in a class of their own, especially as they retained nearly their entire title-winning roster.\n\nIn a column stating the winners and losers of the first week of free agency, ESPN's Zach Lowe listed the Celtics among the winners.\n\n\"Continuity matters,\" Lowe wrote as he discussed the 76ers' title chances in his column. \"The Boston Celtics, still the measuring stick, have it; Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are entering their eighth season together, and Boston is bringing back its entire championship rotation -- headed by five of the top 40 or so players in the league.\"\n\nIn a discussion on which team in the East poses the top three to Boston on ESPN's \"Get Up!\", NBA reporter Tim Bontemps joked that it might be the Celtics themselves due to the exorbitant salaries they'll have to pay in the future after giving Jayson Tatum and Derrick White extension. He ultimately picked the 76ers, but recognized that it's a tall task for them.\n\n\"They have the best big three in the NBA,\" Bontemps said. \"While the Knicks might be a deeper, more stable team that's got a B-plus outcome ... the Sixers have the highest ceiling out of all of the competition for Boston in the league. When you look at where the Celtics are at and how much talent they have, they're going to have to hit a pretty high-end outcome. Philly, if they can stay healthy, massive if, that's what they have the ability to do.\"\n\nIn the same segment, Brian Windhorst agreed with Bontemps, but also noted that the 76ers and Bucks haven't been reliably healthy in the postseason as of late.\n\n\"If we can turn injuries off on the video game, I'd love to see Philly play Boston, Windhorst said.\n\nESPN NBA front office insider Bobby Marks bluntly stated that he doesn't think anyone in the East has a chance against the Celtics this season.\n\n\"No, they're not,\" Marks said when asked if the 76ers were good enough to overtake the Celtics on \"Get Up!\" \"Neither are the Knicks. I think Boston is on an island by themselves right now. I think the window to overtake Boston is going to be in 2025-26, when possibly this Celtics team could break up because of finances.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

According to the Boracha Laranja portal, the center will be on the Celtics team that will participate in the Summer League. For Boston, the competition targeting young players begins on July 13.\n\nNeemias Queta joined Boston in 2023/24 and became a champion in his first season, after two years with the Sacramento Kings (2021/22 and 2022/23), who selected him 39th overall in the 2021 draft.\n\nOn a team full of great players, Neemias Koita had little room to show himself, rarely getting into the rotation and being used only sparingly in the playoffs, but he was always highly praised by coach Joe Mazzola.\n\nThe Portuguese was on the court for just three of the Celtics' 19 games, including one in the final, where he came on with 5:25 left, as Boston lost by 45 points to the Mavericks, in what was their only defeat in the series (84-122).\n\nIn the short time he spent in the \"finals\", he scored two points, converted the only \"shot\" he attempted, and also managed to interfere with the shot, \"winning\" seven points while he was on the court.\n\nPreviously, he played in the first two games of the conference semifinals, with the Cleveland Cavaliers, winning 120-95 and losing 94-118, with the games decided. He added two points and three rebounds in eight minutes.\n\nHowever, after signing a record contract with the Celtics, on April 8, he was part of Boston's \"15\" team selected for the playoffs and was always on the bench.\n\nWith his use in three playoff games, a first ever, Neemias Queta has a total of 31 goals in the 2023/24 season, having been in 28 regular season games, almost all of which (24) have been decisive wins for the Massachusetts team.\n\nIn the regular season, the 24-year-old Portugal international averaged 5.5 points and 4.4 rebounds in 11.9 minutes.", "source": {"uri": "brytfmonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "brytfmonline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "melody_gross@brytfmonline.com", "name": "Melody Gross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Basketball_League_(1925\u20131955)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Basketball League (1925\u20131955)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neemias_Queta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neemias Queta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.impresa.pt/olimpia/2024-06-18-neemias-queta-nba.jpg-2466196a-1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1040, "textEnd": 1047}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-08", "textStart": 2183, "textEnd": 2190}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The recent departure of Charles Lee to the Hornets likely means MacLeay and his fellow assistant coaches will move up a seat as the team looks to promote from within. MacLeay has worked closely with Celtics' center Kristaps Porzingis, and will bring his knowledge of player development this summer.\n\nCook currently plays in Spain's LIGA ACB, but got his start with Jayson Tatum at Chaminade College Prep in St. Louis. He played for various NBA teams from 2019-2022, before moving to LIGA ACB last season. The 6-foot-8, 250-pound forward started three of 13 games played this season and shot 57.1 percent from the field. He averaged 9.5 points.\n\nThe 6-foot-3 guard has been with the Celtics for two seasons on two-way contracts and signed his third Monday, one week after he became an unrestricted free agent. Davison will not be eligible for a fourth two-way contract, and was eligible for a third only because the Celtics did not submit a qualifying offer to him. He's appeared in 20 regular-season games during his two years in Boston, averaging 2 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 1.3 assists.\n\nEnaruna was not originally selected during the 2024 draft, but the Celtics signed him to an Exhibit 10 deal at the beginning of July. The 6-foot-8, 217-pound forward is fresh off of a strong season with Cleveland State, where he transferred from Iowa State in 2022. During his two years in Cleveland, Enaruna started in all 70 games and shot 50.6 percent from the field and 70.8 percent from the line, and averaged 6.5 rebounds per game.\n\nHarper Jr. has been in Toronto for two seasons, appearing in just 10 games, averaging 2 points and 0.7 rebounds. Prior to signing with the Raptors, the 6-foot-6, 230-pound forward played four seasons at Rutgers, where he played an average of 29.1 minutes, and recorded 108 starts over 121 games played. Harper Jr. was with Toronto on a two-way contract this season, but was waived in December due to injury. A solid performance during summer league could open doors for him in Boston.\n\nHouse may currently be unsigned, but he's no stranger to the Celtics -- his father, Eddie, helped secure Boston's 2008 title and now works for NBC Sports Boston on game broadcasts. The 6-foot, 165-pound guard was not drafted by the Celtics, though he participated in the team's pre-draft workouts. He spent his first two years of NCAA eligibility at Arizona State before he transferred to New Mexico for the final three, where he started in all 94 career games and shot 88.5 percent from the free throw line in his last season.\n\nThe 6-foot-8, 205-pound forward signed a two-way deal in 2023 that remains active. Peterson has played just 44 minutes for the Celtics, adding 15 points across four games. Prior to joining the Celtics, the forward suited up for the Trojans at the Southern California, where he started in 93 of his 96 career games with a .731 free throw percentage and a .447 field goal percentage.\n\nQueta, who will turn 25 on July 13, re-signed with the Celtics July 2 in a multi-year deal after the team initially declined his $2.2 million option for next season. During the 2023-24 regular season, Queta appeared in 28 games, averaging 5.5 points and 4.4 rebounds while shooting 71.4 percent from the line. The 7-foot, 258-pound backup center was re-signed with Luke Kornet, and with Porzingis' injury, the two could see more playing time during the regular season.\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 195-pound guard played one season of NCAA ball at Texas Tech, where he was the highest-ranked recruit in school history and first five-star recruit to join the program, before declaring for the 2020 NBA Draft after his freshman year. Ramsey was drafted by Sacramento and played two seasons with the Kings, but was waived at the end of 2022, leading him to sign a G League entry contract. He was initially picked up by the Birmingham Squadron before being traded to the Oklahoma City Blue the next day -- he went on to sign two 10-day contracts with the Raptors from March 5-25 and averaged 17.3 minutes in seven games played.\n\nThe Celtics used their first-round draft selection to secure the 6-foot-7, 203-pound guard. Scheierman led the No. 3 Blue Jays to the NCAA Sweet 16 this year, and played 39 minutes and put up 25 points in a loss to No. 2 Tennessee. Scheierman has said his high school quarterback experience helps him be a better playmaker on the court, and it will be interesting to see how Coach MacLeay continues developing Scheierman's skills.\n\nSpringer spent his first three years in the league with Philadelphia, and arrived in Boston at the trade deadline this past February. The 6-foot-4, 215-pound guard is under contract through the 2024-25 season, and appeared in 17 games for the Celtics after the trade for a total of 49 games played last season. The addition of Springer gave the Celtics more depth on the wing and another strong bench defender, and the Tennessee alum will look to build on those strengths this summer.\n\nTillie was waived by Memphis ahead of the 2022-2023 regular season, and had ankle surgery in 2023 which left him inactive for the 2023-2024 season as well. After leaving Gonzaga in 2020, the 6-foot-9, 220-pound center appeared in 54 games for the Grizzlies across two seasons, averaging 3.2 points and 1.6 rebounds per game. The Frenchman remains an unsigned free agent, but signed a summer league contract.\n\nWalsh has played twelve games in his first season with the Celtics, and completed one year of his 3-4 year contract. The 6-foot-7, 215-pound forward also appeared in three playoff games, including the Game 4 Finals loss to Mavericks. Last Summer League, Walsh averaged 16 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.6 assists across the Celtics' five games, and will look to be an impactful player this season as well.\n\nWatson was selected by the Celtics in the second round of the 2024 draft, and is fresh off his final season at Gonzaga. The 6-foot-8, 236-pound forward led the No. 5 Bulldogs to the Sweet 16, though they fell to No. 1 Purdue. Watson's addition to the Celtics brings defensive versatility and an obstacle for opposition, two things he's likely to work on during the summer league season.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

But his former teammate Robert Parish thinks that Paul Pierce was actually the greatest offensive player in Celtics history.\n\n\"In my opinion, I think he was the greatest offensive Celtic ever, in my opinion,\" Parish said at Paul Pierce's jersey retirement dinner Saturday.\n\n\"I just think that Paul was more creative. He was a better scorer than Larry and John Havlicek. I think that Larry and John Havlicek and Paul were the best offensive players that the Celtics ever had. I think Paul tops that list in my opinion.\"\n\nIt's a statement that will turn some heads, but comes from a unique viewpoint with Parish being a part of the original Big Three with Bird and Kevin McHale. The Chief spent 12 seasons with Bird and watched his three MVP campaigns up close.\n\nParish had a great admiration for how Pierce was able to put his ego and spotlight to the side to join forces with Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, forming the second generation of the Big Three in Boston that would go on to win the 2008 NBA Finals in their first season together.\n\n\"You have got to respect and admire him because superstars rarely put their egos aside for the team,\" Parish said. \"Paul embraced Allen and Garnett, which says a lot for him to share the spotlight with other superstars. That shows the type of person that Paul is and the respect and admiration that everyone has for him, because I think he is a genuinely nice person.\"\n\nPierce ended up finishing second in career points for the Celtics at 24,021, trailing only Havlicek's 26,395. Bird finished third with 21,791 and Parish finished fourth with 18,245.\n\nThere has been a general acceptance of the argument that Pierce may be the most unstoppable scorer in the history of the franchise.

Not only did they win the franchise's record-setting 18th title, the vibes and chemistry of the group were fantastic. It made playing extra fun.\n\n\"It was a lot of fun, a lot of laughs, a lot of jokes, just everybody getting along,\" White told Chris Forsberg on NBC Sports Boston's Celtics Talk Podcast.\n\n\"I feel like we didn't have any issues at any point, and then on the court, you can see how well we played and just how unselfish it was every time and everybody just wanted the next person to succeed. And so anytime you're on a team like that it's special, I'm just looking forward to getting back. I know this season just ended, but I'm looking forward to another ride.\"\n\nWhite will be in Boston long term after signing a four-year, $125.9 million extension with the Celtics last week. The deal begins in the 2025-26 campaign. The extension came together pretty quickly, and White is thankful for that.\n\n\"Like I said the whole time -- I loved it in Boston and I was hopeful and I'm very thankful that it all happened pretty quickly and I don't have to answer questions about it all (next) season,\" White said. \"It was pretty easy. I just wanted to be there and they wanted me there. So it worked out.\"\n\nNot only did White sign an extension, so did Jayson Tatum. The C's superstar signed the richest contract in league history -- a five-year supermax deal worth $315 million.\n\nIf you look at the 11 players who played the most minutes per game for the Celtics last season, all of them are coming back for the title defense. It's rare to see a team win a championship and bring back their top 10 or 11 players.\n\nBut clearly the Celtics know they have a great group that works well together on and off the court. If you can keep that going another year, it's definitely worth doing.\n\n\"It's exciting,\" White said when asked about most of the team coming back. \"I think everybody knows just how much we got along and just enjoyed playing with each other. So I think it's just going to be a lot of fun.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/07/Derrick-White-USATSI_23606492.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Although not the easiest task it was definitely the most rewarding and surely he'd agree. Throughout many different rosters, teams and coaches he was able to claim victory with Joe Mazzulla and the Boston Celtics.\n\nHowever, the 38-year-old has decided to sell his house this offseason but don't worry C's fans he'll still be around.\n\n\"Before news broke of his team's majority owner deciding to cash out his share of the ball club, champion Boston Celtics big man Al Horford decided to sell his capacious Brookline home,\" Celtics Wire's Justin Quinn prefaced before saying, \"But fans of the Celtics need not worry about his future with Boston, as the veteran forward has made it abundantly clear he is coming back to play with the Celtics for their 2024-24 campaign.\"\n\nHorford is right where he needs to be and with a roster keeping its core -- they're primed for more success down the road. It's going to be very fun for the Cs to watch.\n\nThe addition of Kristaps Porzingis led to a smaller role for Horford -- coming off the bench. But his contributions never wavered as he played big-time and stepped up in his absence due to injury.\n\nHorford finished this past season scoring 8.6 points, snatching 6.4 rebounds and passing 2.6 assists. With Porzingis expected to miss the beginning of the season, the starting center position is his for the taking.\n\nThis upcoming 2024-25 NBA year comes with high expectations, not just because the Celtics are defending champions but Brad Stevens did all of the work on his end to keep the squad together.\n\nThey are positioned for even more greatness.\n\nThe surge of Jaylen Brown seems like he's entering his prime after a polished season. Jayson Tatum will be Jayson Tatum and the supporting cast of Sam Hauser, Payton Pritchard and Xavier Tillman are back to lend a hand.\n\nHorford is just a piece of this organization but without the help of everyone from the front office, medical staff, trainers, coaches, and teammates -- the Boston Celtics would not be who they are.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Musketeers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Musketeers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3385,h_1904,x_0,y_68/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/18/01j274j9dzgs2ye1kxtq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The action tips off Saturday in Las Vegas where the Celtics will take on the Heat.\n\nThe roster features familiar faces such as JD Davison, Neemias Queta, and Drew Peterson. There are also some new additions such as rookies Baylor Scheierman and Anton Watson.\n\nGet to know the roster with this quick primer.\n\nTyler Cook: The 6-foot-8, 255-pound forward has four seasons of G-League experience under his belt including stops with the Canton Charge, Iowa Wolves, Oklahoma City Blue, and Salt Lake City Stars. He played overseas in Spain for Joventut Badalona last season.\n\nJD Davison: Davison, who averaged 21 points and fifth in the G-League in assists per game (8.5) last season, came to the Celtics as a second-round pick in 2022. His quickness and leaping ability helped him become a five-star prospect in high school, and emerged as an All-NBA G-League Third Team selection last season after going one and done at Alabama.\n\nTristan Enaruna: Enarnua signed an Exhibit-10 deal with the Celtics after going un-drafted this year. The two-time All-Horizon league selection averaged 19.6 points per game last season and is listed as a 6-foot-8, 220-pound forward. He grew up in the Netherlands.\n\nRon Harper Jr.: The 6-foot-4, 233-pound guard averaged 13.8 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists last season for Raptors 905. He is the son of five-time NBA champion Ron Harper, who won titles with the Bulls and Lakers.\n\nJaelen House: The son of former Celtics guard Eddie House, who was a key reserve on the 2008 title team. The younger House began his college career at his father's alma mater Arizona State before transferring to New Mexico State for his final three seasons. He averaged 15.9 points per game last season.\n\nDrew Peterson: The Southern Cal product averaged 15.5 points and 5.6 rebounds for Maine last season. The 6-foot-9, 205-pound forward shot 45.9 percent from the field, 36.9 percent from 3-point range, and 81.5 percent from the free-throw line last season.\n\nNeemias Queta: The 7-footer from Portugal played in 28 games for the Celtics last season, averaging 5.5 points and 2.5 rebounds. He was an All-NBA G-League First Team selection in 2023, averaging 14.4 points, 8.8 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks while shooting 65.8 percent from the field.\n\nJahmi'us Ramsey: The 6-foot-3, 193-pound guard was an All NBA G-League Third Team selection. He averaged 22 points and 8.2 rebounds while shooting 54.8 percent from the field and 40.9 percent from 3-point range.\n\nBaylor Scheierman: The 6-foot-6, 205-pound sharpshooter was the Celtics' first-round pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. He was a First Team All-Big East and Third Team All-American selection at Crieghton last season. He shot 39 percent from 3-point range during his college career.\n\nJaden Springer: Springer was a first-round pick in 2021, when Philadelphia took him No. 28 overall. The 6-foot-4, 205-pound was the 2023 G-League Finals MVP and steals leader in 2023. The Celtics traded a second-round pick for Springer last year, and he played in 17 games for them.\n\nKillian Tillie: The 6-foot-9 French forward last played in the NBA for Memphis in 2022. The Gonzaga product has spent the past two seasons recovering from injuries. He told Sports Illustrated in May that he is feeling healthy and looking forward to playing.\n\nJordan Walsh: At 20 years old, Walsh is the youngest player on the Celtics' Summer League roster. Boston selected Walsh in the second-round last year, and he averaged 14.7 points to go with 7.5 assists for Maine last season. A lanky defender whom the Celtics hope to develop into a 3-and-D prospect, Walsh shot 36.1 percent from beyond the arc last season.\n\nAnton Watson: Watson's calling card is his defense. Celtics summer league coach DJ MacLeay said the 6-foot-8, 230-pound forward's on-ball defense is \"special\". But, the Celtics also want him to shoot more from the outside than he did in college (41.2 percent on 1.5 3-point attempts) last season. Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said he wants to see the All-WCC First Team selection \"let it fly\" this summer.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It's not their fault,\" O'Neal said during a recent episode of The Big Podcast. \"It's not their fault. I don't care, they won ... they won it and they won it square but there is still a lot of doubters.\"\n\nThe Celtics were far from the only team to face injuries during the playoffs. Miami's Jimmy Butler, Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell, and Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton all missed games against the Celtics. Dallas's Luka Doncic was reportedly receiving pain-killing injections during the Finals.\n\n\"Their road was too easy, so when their road stiffens up and they don't win, then that statement will be verified. Now, if they win next year, with all these teams healthy you've got to give them their respect. But, you know how us haters and us commentators do. OK, you got one, win two.\"\n\n\"I'm impressed by this year but this year is already over,\" O'Neal added. \"So if you want to impress me, if you want to separate yourself as the best, most successful franchise, beat those teams when they are healthy.\"\n\nWith the win, the Celtics moved back into sole possession of the most titles by a single NBA franchise. They broke the 17-17 tie with the Lakers. O'Neal won three titles with the Lakers as a player.

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports / Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAnton Watson spent the draft with his friends and family at the Centennial Hotel near downtown Spokane, Washington. The former Gonzaga star saw the Celtics cap the first round by selecting Baylor Scheierman, a six-foot-six sharpshooter from Creighton.\n\nWhen the second round started a day later, he watched anxiously as other prospects from his draft class heard their name called. As players came off the board in the mid-40s, per Cole Forsman of Gonzaga Nation, Watson admitted, \"It started getting a little tense in there.\"\n\nBut when Boston came on the clock at pick No. 54, Watson's wait was over.\n\n\"It was just a special moment,\" expressed Watson. \"I've never seen my dad cry like that. First time ever, really. And yeah, (my family and friends) were just all super proud of me. Just to be in that moment and have all of them support me, support what I've done throughout my whole life and career. They knew I was ready to be in that position, so it was just kind of full circle and I just took it all in.\"\n\nThe six-foot-eight forward said that the Celtics president of basketball operations, Brad Stevens, told him during his pre-draft workouts in Boston that \"he had his eye on me and he kind of told me, he likes me a lot, likes GU and knows what I bring to the team,\" shared Watson. He also noted that Stevens enjoys watching the former Bulldog showcase his versatility on the defensive end of the court, including his ability to switch onto big men in the post.\n\nAt the offensive end, Watson makes an impact off the ball as a savvy cutter who finishes well at the rim. He also made 41.2% of his threes last season, but he only averaged 1.5 attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nAs Stevens made clear as he discussed Boston's rookie class after the draft concluded, he wants Watson to \"let it fly.\"\n\n\"He has confidence in my shot,\" said Watson. \"That was huge, hearing it from him ... he wants me to let it fly. So, in these workouts, I've been shooting a lot of threes, you know, letting it fly. Once it comes to the game, I think he wants to see me do that and build that confidence.\"\n\nWhile achieving one's dream of getting drafted into the NBA is a life-changing moment, for the six-foot-eight forward, who went 130-19 in his collegiate career and helped lead Gonzaga to a national championship appearance, getting drafted by the reigning champions, with a chance to aid in providing Banner 18 with more company in the TD Garden rafters, made his night that much more special.\n\n\"It's a winning culture with the Celtics,\" expressed Watson. \"I think everyone knows that. I think they want me to come in and try to produce like right away. Develop as a player, develop in the league, and you know, what I do best is win games.\"\n\nThe first chance to see Watson suit up for the Celtics is at Summer League on Saturday, Jul. 13, against the Heat.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nCeltics' Coaching Staff Changes Match Theme of Boston's Offseason\n\nCeltics Roster, Salary Cap Breakdown After Whirlwind Start to Free Agency\n\nCeltics, Jayson Tatum

This is the third time the Celtics have signed the 21-year-old guard to a two-way deal since selecting the Alabama product in the second round of the 2022 NBA Draft.\n\nDavison spent the majority of the last two seasons playing in the G League -- he appeared in just 20 games total over the last two seasons with the Celtics and most of his playing time came in garbage time. He showed plenty of promise in the G League this past season when he averaged 20.8 points, 8.6 assists, 5.4 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 0.8 blocks in 28 games.\n\nThe athletic 6-foot-3, 195-pound guard is a work in progress as a shooter.

It'll feature multiple prominent bench players from Boston's regular season run last season, Jordan Walsh's return after his strong Vegas showing in 2023 and the team's two draft picks Baylor Scheierman and Anton Watson. The team will practice this week under head coach D.J. MacLeay before traveling to Las Vegas on Thursday for rookie orientation and the team's opening game on Saturday against the Heat.\n\nWalsh spent most of last year in the G-League (48 G) after the Celtics selected him No. 38 overall in the 2023 draft. Boston signed him to a standard four-year contract with partial guarantees and a fourth-year team option, and initially looked at him as a likely two-year development project in Maine. Walsh averaged 14.7 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game with 1.0 steals and 0.7 blocks while shooting 42.8% from the field. His 36.1% efficiency on 5.7 threes per game was the most encouraging development while fouling 3.0 times per game is his biggest point of improvement. Brad Stevens emphasized last month that roster players like Walsh who didn't play often after March need to ramp-up for regular season involvement by playing, so while many second-year pros don't participate extensively in their second Summer League, Walsh might due to his limited rookie playing time. Will he dominate like many sophomores do? Or will he play a role as he focused on with Maine?\n\n\"Jordan came out after being a role player after one year in college, jumped and spent a lot of time in Maine this year,\" Austin Ainge said on Monday. \"His body has gotten stronger, his shooting has gotten better. This will be another good opportunity for growth for him.\"\n\nScheierman landed with the Celtics with the No. 30 pick after many projections had him going higher. He said that he expected to get drafted on the first day, but fell to the last pick with Boston, a team he worked out for when he went through the draft process in 2022. It's hard not to get excited about a wing who brings size, shooting success on a massive volume (38.1% 3PT, 9.0 att.) and some playmaking skills (4.3 APG, 19.9 AST%). Scheierman adapted well to the Big East level, growing stronger and more athletic after the Celtics asked him to work on those two areas two years ago, when he transferred from South Dakota State. How will he fare on defense? Does he look on par with NBA athletes in Las Vegas? How much could he contribute in year one with Walsh earlier in his development and Oshae Brissett and Svi Mykhailiuk still in free agency? Scheierman could eventually replace Sam Hauser, but his skillset has been described as complementary and different from Hauser's. He compared himself to Joe Ingles on Monday.\n\n\"Just working on defense. Learning the schemes and the wording, it's a lot different than it was in college,\" Scheierman said. \"My defense has come a long way, looking back, from when I was as a freshman to now. It's come a long way and I'm super confident on that end of the court. Then, just the biggest difference, I think, is the spacing on the NBA floor compared to the college floor.\"\n\nThe Celtics selected Watson 54th overall after he spent five seasons at Gonzaga and dealt with an injury during the pre-draft process, he noted on Monday. Stevens and Celtics summer league coach DJ MacLeay have stressed that Watson shoots threes like he never has before, trying to shake some of the hesitation out of his approach from behind the arc. Boston believes he can further grow his volume and confidence behind the line to help find an offensive role that complements his defensive versatility. For now, his presence on offense drew college defenders away from him, but he grew to 41.2% from behind the college line on 51 three-point attempts during his final college season. How many threes can he get off in summer league and how confident he proves taking them will decide both where he fits in on the final team roster and whether or not he could contribute to the front court dynamic with Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is out early in the season. Watson projects closer to a four positionally given his height and defensive switching ability, along with his likely limitations inside the arc.\n\n\"Shooting is obviously a big piece,\" Watson said. \"Kind of like that Al Horford role. He's a great shooter. I think learning from him is gonna be huge for me. Actually, all the veterans on this team. Shooting is gonna be huge and just my defense, using that to my strength, coming out and guarding every single game. That's gonna be big for me, but shooting is gonna open up my offensive ability.\"\n\nThe Celtics made an appeal to Davison to both play a third summer league and return on a third two-way contract, the last allowed for him with Boston. Stevens stressed wanting him back, unprompted, while discussing the draft last month and the Celtics re-signed him after declining to extend a qualifying offer, which would've made him a restricted free agent. Davison took significant strides last season with Maine, averaging 20.8 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 8.6 APG on 45.3% shooting, but declined to 26.6% from three while doubling his attempts. That and his size, with limited positional versatility, prevented him from earning many NBA looks through his first two seasons. His defense improved slightly and his youth points toward room for growth, but with four active roster guards in front of him, he still faces an uphill battle to advancing beyond the G-League here despite his occasionally dazzling passing. Davison was Stevens' first draft pick, 53rd overall, in 2022. Boston maintains flexibility over its three two-way slots despite signing Davison and Drew Peterson to two of them for now.\n\n\"JD came out very young in the draft and the last two years in Maine, he's really improved,\" Ainge said. \"We've loved his trajectory and think he still has room to grow. He's younger than the guys we just drafted and a lot of other guys that were drafted, and think he still has some growth. We're very optimistic.\"\n\nAn undrafted forward the Celtics signed to a two-way contract last year after he began his pro career with the Sioux Falls Skyforce, Miami's G-League affiliate. The Heat liked Peterson, but didn't have two-way space for him on their roster. Boston hoped Peterson could begin developing into the shooting wing mold like Hauser did, seeing mixed results across 34 regular season games with Maine. He averaged 16.1 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 5.6 APG and 1.1 SPG while shooting 45.9% from the field and 36.7% form three on 6.1 attempts. Seeing him improve his three-point shooting, cut down on turnovers (2.7 TOV) and clearly separating himself from the rest of the roster will help him fully solidify himself as part of Boston's 2024 development plans. His age could limit his ceiling slightly, but the Celtics have emphasized being able to mold talented players who didn't work elsewhere to their system.\n\n\"There's a mindset of improvement,\" MacLeay said. \"Three weeks ago yesterday, we were in the Garden winning a championship. Now, we're here in a situation where we have an opportunity to grow toward the next one. Thinking back on the past of Sam Hauser and Payton Pritchard, those guys started their growth points here ... they each have individual things that they're working on from a basketball perspective, but it's the mindset of growth. How can you get better each and every day?\"\n\nAlready a major success story for the team's scouting and development, adding him through some stroke of luck when the Kings decided to waive him to sign Javale McGee and a bit of foresight, seeing past his foot injury last summer and immediately inserting him into preseason and early regular season opportunities. Queta helped the Celtics sustain through rest and injuries at the center position, averaging 16.6 points, 13.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists per 36 minutes in the NBA while shooting 64.4%. After the Celtics added Xavier Tillman Sr., he joined Maine for their playoff run, posting 13.2 PPG, 13.6 RPG and 2.0 BPG across five games. Finishing closer to 70%, trying to step outside of the paint for some jump shots, protecting the rim without fouling (5.4 fouls per 36 last season) and dominating enough to take an early seat are all worth watching for from him as he enters summer league overqualified and signed to a guaranteed $2.2 million deal for next year just above the league minimum using non-Bird rights. Queta will be an intriguing part of the team's attempt to play without Porzi\u0146\u0123is next year.\n\nDidn't play often after arriving from Philadelphia to step into the team's development guard role in place of Dalano Banton. He enters 2024-25, his contract year, needing to show some flashes offensively to complement his excellent defense. As a first-round pick, he'll make $4.0 million guaranteed. Like Walsh, he could stand to benefit from playing often in Las Vegas despite his active roster status. Springer becomes important in case of injury in the back court, but will likely spend some time in Maine when Boston plays at full health. He averaged 9.7 points, 5.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists per 36 minutes in 17 appearances with the Celtics, shooting 43.3% from the field and 18.2% from three, similar to his production with Philadelphia that led the Sixers to move on in favor of luxury tax savings. It's becoming make-or-break time for him with Boston and could use a strong summer showing to enter the season in rhythm. He'll likely have a similar message to Watson. Shoot. Shoot!\n\nA bigger wing from the Netherlands who split his college career between Kansas, Iowa State and Cleveland State. The Celtics signed him quickly after the draft concluded and are high on his production last season, when he averaged 19.6 PPG, 6.5 RPG and 2.7 APG with 1.2 SPG and 0.9 BPG, shooting 49.8% from the field and 32.2% from three. He was a four-star prospect exiting high school, considered a strong athlete who gets off the ground quickly and had good shot mechanics who needed to improve his driving and ball-handling. He finished college 26.6% from three, something he'll need to show some improvement over if he wants to make a run at a two-way spot with the Celtics or elsewhere.\n\nA fun player from New Jersey and Rutgers, whose father Ron Harper played in the NBA and younger brother Dylan Harper is one of the top prospects projected to enter the 2025 NBA Draft. Ron began his nBA career with the Toronto Raptors' system before dealing with an injury that cost him the 2023-24 season. The Raptors waived him last December. He averaged 16.7 points, 5.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists with 1.0 steal and 1.2 blocks per game in 30 appearances with Raptors 905 in 2022-23. He shot 50.1% from the field and 36.6% from three. He's undersized for his position, more of a bruising wing than a guard, but Harper is a talented offensive player worth watching.\n\n\"He's a guy we've been interested in for a while,\" Ainge said. \"He's coming off an injury and that's, I think, one reason why he's not on a roster right now and we have an opportunity to get another look at him. He's looked good in practice. I think he'll get opportunities and looks with us and with other teams. He's a big, strong kid, long and he has good feel. He knows how to play.\"\n\nA formerly intriguing Grizzlies prospect who always battled injuries and hasn't played since the 2022 season. Kevin O'Connor ranked him 46th in his 2020 draft guide, considering his health, and noting strong potential between his three-point shot, passing and defense as a smaller five. A knee surgery, torn ligament in his foot, stress fracture in his ankle, hip pointer and sprained ankle derailed his professional career before it began and this summer could mark the last chance for him to reach the NBA. He averaged 9.2 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.7 assists per 36 minutes in 2022 with Memphis, shooting 33.9% from the field and 31.4% from three. Tillie played with Watson during the latter's freshman season in 2019-20.\n\nWon the G-League championship last year over the Celtics with the Oklahoma City Blue, averaging 22.3 points, 8.2 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game in 18 regular season appearances, shooting 55.3% from the field and 42.5% from three on 4.1 attempts per game. His shooting carried into the playoffs, improving to 44.0% from three on 5.0 attempts. Ramsey played one season at Texas Tech in 2019-20 before the Kings selected him 43rd overall. KOC considered him his 37th overall prospect in 2020, highlighting his shooting alongside needed playmaking improvement.\n\nBig wing who secured a standard contract with the Cavaliers after going undrafted in 2019 out of Iowa. He played with eight NBA organizations between his first four seasons, averaging 15.4 PPG, 7.7 RPG and 2.5 APG on 62.4% shooting. He's not a three-point shooter and hit only 54.7% of his free throws during his four G-League seasons. Cook spent the 2023-24 season with Joventut Badalona in Spain and a brief stint with South East Melbourne, Australia, averaging 10.1 PPG on 54.6% shooting between the two.\n\nThe son of Celtics champion Eddie House. He played five college seasons between Arizona State and New Mexico, averaging 15.9 PPG, 3.5 RPG and 3.5 APG on 37.4% shooting (32.8% 3PT), adding 2.3 SPG. Scheierman called him one of the most competitive players in the Celtics' practices so far. His 28 points helped New Mexico beat San Diego State in the Mountain West Conference championship to reach the NCAA Tournament.", "source": {"uri": "clnsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CLNS

For the Boston Celtics, who won their 18th championship in franchise history this summer over the Dallas Mavericks, they certainly have a good chance at doing so by bringing back a majority of the 2023-24 roster into 2024-25.\n\nBut an NBA analyst and former Celtics player doesn't believe they'll complete the feat.\n\n\"Boston had it easy. It's not their fault,\" Shaquille O'Neal said on \"The Big Podcast\" recently. \"It's not their fault. I don't care, they won. ... they won it and they won it square but there is still a lot of doubters. Their road was too easy, so when their road stiffens up and they don't win, then that statement will be verified. Now, if they win next year, with all these teams healthy you've got to give them their respect. But, you know how us haters and us commentators do. OK, you got one, win two.\"\n\n\"I'm impressed by this year but this year is already over,\" O'Neal added. \"So if you want to impress me, if you want to separate yourself as the best, most successful franchise, beat those teams when they are healthy.\"\n\nIn the first round, the Heat dealt with an injury to star Jimmy Butler that limited him, Cleveland was without Donovan Mitchell and the Pacers were down Tyrese Haliburton. The Mavericks were also dealing with an injury to star Luka Doncic, who was heavily wrapped prior to games and also receiving pain-killing injections.\n\nThe Celtics were also without Kristaps Porzingis for most of their playoff run in which they went 16-3. Porzingis dealt with a calf injury that kept him out of the entire second- and third-round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Indiana Pacers, respectively. He then suffered a rare leg injury in the Finals that kept him out of Games 3 and 4, but he returned to the championship-clinching Game 5.\n\nBut they were still stacked with players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford and Derrick White.\n\nInjuries are part of the game and can happen to any player at any time. The Celtics were able to get the job done and capitalized when their opponents weren't at 100% health.\n\nWhile Porzingis will miss the beginning of the season after undergoing successful surgery on his leg, the rest of the Celtics figure to be healthy as they begin their defense of their league-leading 18th title.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/WEAXGLRZ2FBGJATYHUFWGVMYAY.jpg?auth=81c1791ad38a885617b1626fe3933ebbbc58ab29c31446f4a84a79ec34440b81&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

However, that doesn't mean Miami intends to back down from Boston, even though the talent gap (still) remains a significant factor entering the 2024-25 season.\n\n\"You saw a lot of players go down throughout the run that Boston had,\" Kevin Love told reporters during Miami's offseason availability Sunday. \"But that's not to take anything away from them because they have set the standard in the NBA. They are that good. They are the proverbial North Star if you will, and in order to get better, we all need to get better. So I don't know what that means from a decision-making standpoint in the front office obviously, but I think health played a major component.\"\n\nIn four of the last five seasons, Miami's gone head-to-head with Boston in the postseason. They've split those meetings evenly, 2-2, yet each time the storyline has been the same: an underdog Heat team riding a Cinderella run, crossing paths with a Celtics team in search of living up to its hype. Butler's absence undoubtedly played a factor, but Boston, too, has endured its fair share of postseason injuries in recent years.\n\nDuring the 2023 conference finals, Jayson Tatum suffered an ankle injury in the do-or-die Game 7 contest. In 2022, Robert Williams III dealt with a meniscus injury, and in 2021 Jaylen Brown (wrist) and Kemba Walker (knee) were both limited.\n\nBut this go-around, Miami just wasn't well-equipped to compete with the 64-win Celtics who went 3-0 in the regular season against the Heat.\n\n\"Overall, (we) just need to get better,\" Love continued. \"We need to be a more cohesive unit.

White had 16.7 points and 4.1 assists per game in the playoffs and shot 40.4% from three-point range.\n\nThe Celtics showed how much they value White by signing the 30-year-old to a massive contract extension this offseason.\n\nIn addition to possessing clutch shot-making ability, White is also a great defender.

Boston had it easy.\"\n\n\"It's not their fault, I don't care, they won,\" he added, referring to the fact that other teams had a key player out injured in every round (while ignoring that the Celtics did as well).\n\n\"Their road was too easy,\" he claimed, evidently forgetting about the league-best record Boston assembled in the regular season as well. \"So, when their road stiffens up, and they don't win, then that statement will be verified.\"\n\nA hot take on Shaq's part, perhaps, but that is what analysts do to keep eyes on them, which he himself admits. \"You know how us haters and us commentators do,\" he said. \"Okay, you got one, win two!\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aristotle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Jayson Tatum just became one of the highest-paid players in league history with Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, and Derrick White staying. While there are a lot of adjustments that Joe Mazzulla and Brad Stevens need to make, their squad is more than willing to be patient. Nothing said that more than one of their star guards expressed a big interest in staying with the organization.\n\nDerrick White came into the Celtics roster with a wonky jump shot and an above-average defensive acumen. This was enough for Brad Stevens to trust him alongside Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. Over time, he developed a reliable stroke from three-point range due to Joe Mazzulla's system. Then, the City of Boston also embraced him as one of their own. He has acclimated well into the local culture and even bought a duck boat.\n\nIt was clear as day that the Celtics had a franchise guard that wanted to stay. White even outlined his desire to remain within the system in his latest statement, via Chris Forsberg of NBC Sports.\n\n\"I said the whole time that I loved it in Boston. I was hopeful and pretty thankful that it all happened pretty quickly and I don't have to answer questions about it all season. It was pretty easy. I just wanted to be there, they wanted me there. So, it worked out. It's exciting. I think everybody knows how well we got along and just enjoy playing with each other. It's just going to be a lot of fun that we don't have to ask questions about it. Everybody's excited to do special things here in Boston,\" White concluded.\n\nSo, it does not look like the Celtics have to worry about chemistry issues down the line.\n\nDerrick White's run with the Celtics so far\n\nIt's safe to say that White was hungry to win it all against the Dallas Mavericks. He sacrificed a tooth in the process and even played a role that enabled their Jaylen Brown-Jayson Tatum duo to thrive on the court. But, that does not mean that his impact decreased. In fact, the opposite happened. His impact grew larger with the help of Joe Mazzulla and Brad Stevens' trust.\n\nIn their 2024-25 campaign, White notched the second-highest average he had in scoring throughout his career. He knocked down 46.1% of his shots from all three levels of the floor while also having a 39.1% clip from three. All of these helped him get 15.2 points per contest. He also had a career-high year in assists. His increased ability to create shots for his teammates netted him 5.2 assists a night.\n\nBut, most of his impact was felt on the defensive side of the court. He was given the All-Defensive 2nd Team nod and even ranked eighth in Defensive Player of the Year voting. Being able to get a steal and 1.2 blocks per game usually helps in that aspect of one's stat sheet. Overall, his run with the Celtics has been nothing but phenomenal.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jump shot (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Defensive_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Defensive Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Derrick-White-vocal-on-quick-Boston-extension-after-NBA-championship.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

He and Watson both had five-year college careers and will turn 24 before the 2024-25 season begins, meaning they should be more pro-ready than some of Boston's other recent draftees.\n\nSpeaking of, prior second-rounders Jordan Walsh (2023) and JD Davison ('22) also will take part in Summer League after spending most of last season with the Celtics' G League affiliate in Maine. Boston's roster for Vegas features a total of five players who were with the team during its NBA championship run: forwards Walsh and Drew Peterson, guards Davison and Jalen Springer, and center Neemias Queta.\n\nWalsh, Queta and Springer were active for all of Boston's postseason games but played only in garbage time. Davison and Peterson did not dress for any playoff contests after making a total of 11 appearances for the big club during the regular season.\n\nRounding out the roster were forwards Tyler Cook, Tristan Enaruna and Ron Harper Jr., guards Jaelen House and Jahmi'us Ramsey, and center Killian Tillie.\n\nThe well-traveled Cook has appeared in games for Cleveland, Denver, Brooklyn, Detroit and Chicago and most recently played for Joventut Badalona in Spain's Liga ACB. Enaruna is an undrafted rookie who averaged 19.6 points per game at Cleveland State last season after stints at Kansas and Iowa State.\n\nHarper, whose father won five NBA titles as a player, appeared in 10 games for Toronto over the last two seasons after going undrafted out of Rutgers. House's father, Eddie, was part of Boston's 2008 championship team and now works as a Celtics analyst for NBC Sports Boston. The younger House went undrafted this year out of New Mexico.\n\nRamsey has bounced between the NBA and G League since being drafted in the second round by Sacramento in 2020. Tillie has 54 games of NBA experience but none since 2022. The 26-year-old Frenchman overlapped with Watson for one season at Gonzaga.\n\nThe Celtics' Summer League squad will be coached by DJ MacLeay, who's entering his third season as an assistant coach under Joe Mazzulla.\n\nWith Boston set to return nearly every member of the veteran-laden roster that delivered the franchise its 18th NBA championship last month, it's unlikely any Summer League participant will be more than a bit player in 2024-25. Queta could see increased playing time early in the season, however, with starting center Kristaps Porzingis set to miss at least the first month following leg surgery. And Scheierman -- an accomplished 3-point shooter who also led the Big East in defensive rebounding (9.0 per game) in his final season at Creighton -- has enough experience to quickly contribute as a depth wing.\n\nThe young C's will open their Summer League slate this Saturday at 6:30 p.m. ET against the Miami Heat. The matchup likely to draw the most eyeballs is their second: next Monday at 10:30 p.m. ET against Bronny James and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBoston then will face the Charlotte Hornets (Wednesday, July 17, 5:30 p.m. ET) and Dallas Mavericks (Friday, July 19, 4:30 p.m. ET) before playing either a playoff or consolation game the following weekend. All games will air locally on NBC Sports Boston and nationally on NBA TV (Heat, Lakers, Hornets) or ESPNU (Mavs).", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"},

Paul Pierce was already on the team, but getting two more All-Star players took the 24-58 record from the 2006/07 season to a 66-16 record the following year. However, the players credit their training camp in Europe as a big reason why they succeeded.\n\n\"We went over to Rome, and that was the best thing that happened to us because we weren't in the States. We were all alone trying to figure out each other, and we just naturally bonded,\" Garnett said about the training camp in Europe. \"We embraced each other to the point where who cares about what these critics say? As long as we stick together, as long as we stay together, and know what the goal is, we can do anything if we put our minds to it.\"\n\nThe Celtics embarked on a magical season\n\nMany people talk about struggles to build chemistry when building a superteam like the Big 3 Celtics. The most recent example in 2008 was the 2003/04 Los Angeles Lakers, who signed aging stars Gary Payton and Karl Malone. While C's had some of the biggest names in the league, they failed because they were not good enough when they made it to the NBA Finals.\n\nThat was not the case for the Celtics because they were superb throughout the regular season. This continued into their postseason run, as Boston finally ended its 22-year drought without a championship.\n\nSince the C's were the NBA's most successful franchise, winning after that kind of drought was cathartic for the team, especially for the Big 3, who were all getting older without a title.\n\nThe Big 3 played all their roles to perfection\n\nGarnett, Allen, and Pierce playing together was a phenomenal decision from the Celtics front office. They all fulfilled their roles within the team, with Ray-Ray as the go-to off-ball shooter, KG as the defensive anchor, and Pierce as the reliable go-to guy, retaining his role in Boston.\n\nIt was a recipe for success because they were superb in the regular season. However, they faced plenty of struggles during the Playoffs, as they had to play two seven-game series against the Atlanta Hawks and a LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers. They beat the Detroit Pistons in the Conference Finals before defeating the fierce rivals, the LA Lakers.\n\nEveryone on the Celtics roster played their roles to perfection. The Big 3 were the stars, while Rajon Rondo showcased promising playmaking, Kendrick Perkins played well as the big body in the paint, and many others. It was a classic Boston championship, but unfortunately, that was the only title they won after the Lakers got their payback in 2010.\n\nRelated: Kevin Garnett reveals how he managed his intense personality: \"I heard Kenny G. as a snake charmer\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cholo_martin_magsino@postandcourier.com", "name": "Cholo Martin Magsino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ray Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_G", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajon_Rondo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajon Rondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/e1/3e1986bb-3cb6-516f-9ca8-91c8709ab39b/668bce9c7288f.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The two-way players can move between the NBA team and its G League affiliate without having to pass through waivers and be exposed to the possibility of being poached by opposing teams.\n\nTwo-way players are eligible to play in as many as 50 games in a season with the NBA team.

In 49 games with Maine, Davison averaged 21.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, 8.8 assists and 1.5 steals. He was a third-team selection for the All-NBA G League team.\n\nAfter defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals, Boston did not make a qualifying offer to Davison by the end of June, which allowed him to become a free agent before the Celtics quickly brought him back with the two-way deal.\n\nDavison is preparing to play with Boston's NBA 2K25 Summer League team in Las Vegas.

The reigning NBA champions have already had a busy offseason as the front office has shored up the roster in hopes of another title next season.\n\nThe C's will virtually bring back the same roster and core of players that won the 2024 championship as they should have a strong chance at repeating. That's rare considering the league's landscape, but the team has prioritized continuity and keeping this strong locker room together.\n\nThus far, the Celtics have already extended Jayson Tatum and Derrick White to huge contracts. Both starters have been crucial to Boston's success over the past few seasons. Tatum also gets his supermax contract extension, which was an expected move. The C's also re-signed big men Luke Kornet, Xavier Tillman and Neemias Queta to shore up their depth. Those moves are especially important considering Kristaps Porzingis will miss the start of next season due to the foot injury he suffered in the NBA Finals.\n\nThe C's also didn't make any trades during the 2024 NBA draft, picking Baylor Scheierman at No. 30 and Anton Watson at No. 54. While the Celtics have been busy, they still have a bit more work to do this summer. A potential Sam Hauser extension can be worked on later. The Celtics do still have an open roster spot, though they could leave that 15th slot open for luxury tax purposes. But for the most part, the C's have seemingly finished up the bulk of the work this summer.\n\nHere's what Boston president Brad Stevens had to say about those respective moves, per press releases:\n\nOn Tatum's extension: \"Jayson is a special person and player, and it's been a thrill for all of us to watch his entire journey in Boston. He has embraced all that comes with being a great Celtic, and shows consistent and genuine care for every one of his teammates, coaches, and staff across the organization. Despite all the team accomplishments and individual awards, Jayson is committed to constantly improving. He works hard and is extremely driven by the challenges of the game - especially the goal of competing with his teammates for championships. We are obviously ecstatic that Jayson chose to extend his contract and add to his amazing career as a Boston Celtic.\"\"\n\nOn White's extension: \"Derrick is a great player who has immersed himself in the Boston community since joining us in the Spring of 2021. Derrick brings a joy and selflessness to our building every single day. He's committed to improving and has shown that in each year of his career. More importantly, he cares most about the things that matter, including building great relationships and competing with integrity. We are very lucky that Derrick is a Celtic and are thrilled he'll be here for years to come.\"\n\nOn Kornet signing: \"Luke has been an integral part of our team over the past few years. He is the ultimate teammate and his attitude and spirit have a contagious effect on our team. On the court, Luke had his best season as a Celtic and played a big role in helping us win. We are excited about the impact he'll have moving forward.\"\n\nOn Tillman signing: \"When we got Xavier at the trade deadline, he came with the reputation of a winner and great teammate. Xavier is a hard-worker who brings grit, toughness, and a team-first mentality that we appreciate.

From the second row of the bench, Mazzulla remained on the Celtics staff even after Boston hired Ime Udoka to be their head coach. Mazzulla was then promoted to interim head coach, and eventually permanent head coach, after Udoka was suspended for all of what was expected to be his second season on the Celtics bench.\n\nDespite a 57-25 record and an Eastern Conference Finals appearance in his first season as Boston's head coach, many Celtics fans remained skeptical of whether Joe Mazzulla was the right man for the job. The 2023-24 season not only dispelled those concerns... it elevated Mazzulla to the top tier of the league's best coaches. Yes, Mazzulla had an absolutely stacked Celtics roster at his disposal, but all year long he pushed the right buttons, played the right guys, and never blinked in the face of adversity or sky-high championship-or-bust expectations.\n\nIn the end, the Celtics didn't bust. After a 64-18 regular season in which Boston finished with the 4th-best net rating in NBA history, the Celts captured the 18th NBA Title in franchise history. With the title win, Joe Mazzulla became the youngest head coach to win an NBA Title since Bill Russell did so as a 35-year-old in 1969.\n\nSince winning the title, Celtics players have been in high demand for media appearances. Recently, reserve forward Sam Hauser was a guest on the Green Light Podcast with Chris Long, and he shared a bizarre, yet ultimately successful tactic that Mazzulla used during Boston's championship season.\n\n\"So his favorite animal is an orca whale, or a killer whale. So he pulled up this clip from National Geographic and it's these three orca whales hunting this seal, and they kind of pop their head out of the water and check out where this seal is at and it's on this isolated piece of ice in the middle of the ocean. And they're kind of scoping it out, and then they all attack this seal and kill it. And his like message was, 'You know killer whales don't do it on their own, they wait for the others to attack their prey before they kill it, and that's what we got to do this year is do it together and nobody can do it on their own.'\n\nThe sentiment behind this unusual message turned out to be the super power of the 2023-24 Boston Celtics. Nobody ever had to do it on their own.\n\nHow do the Celtics respond to Joe Mazzulla?\n\nFrom there, Chris Long asked Sam Hauser what portion of the team responded well to Joe Mazzulla's unorthodox coaching tactics. Given the clip that the Celtics have won at under Mazzulla, it's not a surprise that the buy-in rate has been pretty high.\n\n\"I'd say it's upwards of 75 percent,\" Sam Hauser responded. \"You know, a couple of movie clips in there that maybe I don't think everybody knows the movie clips he shows sometimes. It's a lot of The Town, Whiplash, a lot of UFC fights, the orca whale thing. I think there was a lion, one where it killed a gazelle or something.\"\n\nAs unusual as it may seem, it's becoming more and more clear that everything Joe Mazzulla does has a defined purpose. Those buttons he's pressing, the clips he's showing his team, they continue to pay off in the long run, and because of that, there's a very good chance that a second consecutive NBA Title could be coming the way of the Boston Celtics next year.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sonny_giuliano@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Sonny Giuliano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Hauser", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Hauser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ime_Udoka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ime Udoka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinniped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4941df3c-3d6c-11ef-b6d8-4ada3520e438.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

I would say I'm definitely figuring (my style) out. I'm learning. I'm growing. I don't know yet. I can tell you for a fact that I'm loud.\"\n\nFirst-round pick Baylor Scheierman (Creighton) and second-rounder Anton Watson (Gonzaga) will play prominent roles in Las Vegas.\n\nWatson, who will wear No. 28, is a 6-foot-8-inch swingman drafted for his defensive prowess and shooting potential. He played 151 games in college and finished with 41.2 percent shooting from the 3-point line in 51 attempts during his senior season, after shooting 25.2 percent during his first four seasons.\n\nThe Celtics have been imploring him to shoot during summer league as they want Watson to turn into a 3-and-D option. President of basketball operations Brad Stevens encouraged Watson to shoot during his draft workout, which was his first of 16 stops.\n\n\"Obviously hearing it from Brad, that's a good man to hear it from,\" Watson said. \"Let it go, let it fly. I feel like I've got a good shot. I've just got to be more confident in practice, let it fly and shoot it as much as I can because the Celtics take the most threes in the NBA.\"\n\nThe brass gave Scheierman and Watson a tour of the Auerbach Center and showed him the championship trophy.\n\n\"Just winners, legacy, just the mentality toward everything,\" Watson said. \"First time we met in here, they said it's different here. That's kind of the vibe you get here and I think they've got the right approach on things.\"\n\nCeltics assistant general manager Austin Ainge said the club's brass will be a tad bit more relaxed this offseason because of the roster stability. Boston has brought back all of its free agents besides swingman Oshae Brissett.\n\n\"The biggest advantage of having a really good team last year is we've got most everyone signed,\" he said. \"I can just enjoy summer league and I'm not running around with a million agents meetings. That's the biggest advantage is we've got a really good team and we're just running it back in large part.\n\n\"We've got most everyone signed up. We had some guys turn down more money other places to come back and it just feels really good that we care about to come back.\"\n\n...\n\nThe Celtics signed former second-round pick JD Davison to a third two-way contract, a week after he became an unrestricted free agent. Teams only have the rights to sign draft picks to two-way contracts for two seasons but since the Celtics did not submit a qualifying offer to Davison, which would have guaranteed a standard NBA contract, they were eligible to add him for a third year. He will not be eligible for a fourth two-way deal.\n\nDavison, 21, was the 53rd overall pick in 2022 out of Alabama and has developed as a point guard, and another two-way contract gives him a chance to vie for minutes with the big club.\n\n\"JD came out very young in the draft and the last two years in Maine, he's really, really improved,\" Ainge said of Davison's time in the G League. \"We've loved his trajectory and I think he still has room to grow. He's younger than the guys we just drafted. He still has some growth. We're very optimistic.\"\n\nAnother intriguing name on the summer league roster is Ron Harper Jr., the son of the five-time NBA champion. The former Rutgers standout went undrafted in 2022 and signed a two-way contract with the Raptors. The guard-forward sustained a season-ending shoulder injury last December and was waived by Toronto.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors":

The Philadelphia 76ers significantly improved their roster by adding Paul George and others. A trio of Western Conference teams could also be waiting in the NBA Finals, ready to dethrone the defending champs.\n\nThe Boston Celtics had an incredible 2023-24 campaign. They were by far the best team in the NBA throughout the regular season and playoffs.\n\nDespite being doubted all year because of past postseason underperformances, Boston boasted a 64-18 record with the fourth-best net rating in league history and finished the job after a 16-3 playoff run.\n\nAs is always the case with this franchise, soon after finally reaching the mountaintop with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown , the doubters swooped back in to question the validity of the championship, citing the relatively easy path that the Celtics had on their way to the title.\n\nAlthough a ring is a ring and Boston earned its road by securing the NBA 's best record by seven games. Next year, the defending champs are sure to face much greater challenges.\n\nBoston brought back everyone from a nine-man rotation to attempt a repeat, but several teams around the league got much better.\n\nWhich teams are approaching the Celtics' level ahead of the 2024-25 season?\n\n5 Philadelphia 76ers The addition of Paul George and role players makes Philly dangerous\n\nDedicated NBA fans know very well how the Celtics have owned the Philadelphia 76ers since Tatum was drafted in 2017.\n\nBoston is 27-16 overall against Philly in those seven years and has beaten them three times in the playoffs (2018, 2020, 2023). This is the main reason Joel Embiid has famously never played in a conference finals despite consistently playing at an MVP level.\n\nAfter losing to an injured New York Knicks team in the first round last season, the Sixers appeared to finally hit rock bottom.\n\nLuckily, they had a ton of cap space this offseason, and they used it as well as they could have by making several key additions.\n\nThe big splash they made was signing Paul George away from the Los Angeles Clippers to upgrade the Tobias Harris spot on the wing. George will fit perfectly as the third option between Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.\n\nHowever, they made some under-the-radar moves as well, adding Andre Drummond , Caleb Martin and Eric Gordon while retaining Kelly Oubre Jr.\n\nDrummond was a badly needed backup center who could effectively eat up the non-Embiid minutes, which were an absolute disaster for Philly in last year's playoffs (minus-44 in Paul Reed's minutes in 6 games). Martin, Gordon and Oubre are all capable two-way wings who can fill out a previously thin rotation next to the big three.\n\nWhat once was a barren roster unfit to compete at the highest level is now ready to support three stars and challenge Boston.\n\nThe Sixers' rotation now looks like this: Embiid, Maxey, George, Martin, Oubre, Gordon, Drummond and promising rookie Jared McCain.\n\n76ers Offseason\n\nAcquired\n\nRetained\n\nDeparted\n\nPaul George\n\nTyrese Maxey\n\nNicolas Batum\n\nAndre Drummond\n\nKelly Oubre Jr.\n\nBuddy Hield\n\nEric Gordon\n\nMo Bamba\n\nCaleb Martin\n\nDe'Anthony Melton\n\nJared McCain\n\nAfter acquiring the wings to better match up with the Celtics, Philly's immense talent, at least on paper, can now be more of a threat to the league's top teams. The future is bright in Philadelphia.\n\n4 Minnesota Timberwolves Another year of Ant and a dominant defense should scare Boston\n\nAlthough they suffered a disappointing five-game defeat at the hands of the Dallas Mavericks in last year's playoffs, the Minnesota Timberwolves were ahead of schedule when they pulled off a stunning upset of the defending champion Denver Nuggets .\n\nThe 20-point third-quarter comeback in Game 7 wasn't supposed to happen in Anthony Edwards ' age-22 season, but the Wolves' physical dominance and lockdown defense stymied the seemingly unbeatable Nuggets.\n\nYes, Minnesota matched up poorly with Dallas, but four of the five games were close, and the Wolves will surely keep improving this year. Another year of ascension from Edwards should put him at an MVP level, and his experience from his latest playoff failure should both fuel him and teach him what he must improve on as a lead ball handler.\n\nLuka Doncic and Kyrie Irving just proved that two elite ball handlers aren't enough to beat Boston with poor surrounding talent, which is worrisome for Minnesota. Luckily, the Wolves traded for Rob Dillingham on draft night, which should elevate their overall level of shot creation on the floor.\n\nThe exciting aspect of Minnesota versus Boston is that the Timberwolves have great defensive personnel to guard the Celtics' five-out attack. Rudy Gobert is an underrated perimeter defender in most matchups, and Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Nickeil Alexander-Walker are three of the best wing defenders in the league.\n\nMinnesota has great options to stick on Brown and Tatum.\n\nTimberwolves Rotation\n\nStarters\n\nBench\n\nAnthony Edwards\n\nRob Dillingham\n\nRudy Gobert\n\nNickeil Alexander-Walker\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns\n\nJoe Ingles\n\nJaden McDaniels\n\nNaz Reid\n\nMike Conley\n\nThe lack of shot creation and off-ball shooting will still be a massive worry against Boston, but Minnesota has the formula to beat the Celtics if they meet in the NBA Finals.\n\n3 New York Knicks Perhaps no team matches up better with Boston after the Mikal Bridges trade\n\nThere are three main reasons the Knicks can take down the Celtics in 2024-25: They matchup perfectly with Boston, have much better depth and have a superstar who can outperform Tatum and Brown in any series.\n\nAs for the last reason, Jalen Brunson has proven to be a special playoff performer after carrying New York in back-to-back playoffs with unbelievable shot-making consistency.\n\nThere are few players in the league who can be relied upon as surely as Brunson to have a great game in a big moment.\n\nTheir depth advantage is simple: New York has three players who would start for most NBA teams in Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo and Miles McBride.\n\nWe just saw these guys start for a Knicks team that made it to within one game of the Eastern Conference Finals, and all three played like they deserved it.\n\nDiVincenzo will be a Sixth Man Of The Year Candidate, Hart is perhaps the best glue guy in the league and McBride is an elite on-ball defender.\n\nHowever, New York is a top threat to the Celtics mainly because of matchups.\n\nThe Knicks will be able to stare down Boston's incredible starting five and its drive-and-kick offense with a unit that can neutralize it better than anyone else.\n\nYou cannot hope to assemble a defensive wing duo better than OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges to guard Tatum and Brown. Mitchell Robinson is one of the league's best rim protectors, and Julius Randle will be a matchup nightmare for whoever guards him.\n\nKnicks Rotation\n\nStarters\n\nBench\n\nJalen Brunson\n\nDonte DiVincenzo\n\nJulius Randle\n\nJosh Hart\n\nMikal Bridges\n\nMiles McBride\n\nOG Anunoby\n\nMitchell Robinson\n\nNew York also has a deadly wrinkle it can add against the Celtics: a terrific small-ball lineup.\n\nPushing Randle to the five and inserting DiVincenzo at the guard position makes the Knicks just as unguardable as Boston while maintaining an elite defense. Kristaps Porzingis is a perimeter-oriented player who won't punish the Knicks for their lack of size, meaning New York can match Boston's formula better than anyone.\n\n2 Denver Nuggets 2023 Champs' edge comes from their execution\n\nFor a second straight offseason, the Nuggets lost a critical member of their 2023 championship team.\n\nKentavious Caldwell-Pope took a better contract than Denver could offer under the new CBA to head to the Orlando Magic.\n\nDenver has only added Dario Saric, who could be useful as a backup big in the non-Nikola Joki\u0107 minutes. Denver will rely heavily on its young players to fill those gaps left by Pope and Bruce Brown.\n\nDenver will desperately need Christian Braun, Peyton Watson and Julian Strawther to step up and fill out the end of the rotation or the Nuggets will have no chance to compete for a title next year. All three have shown tremendous potential but have been inconsistent at best so far in their careers.\n\nHowever, this is a bet on their top four players, who remain an elite group. Jamal Murray , Aaron Gordon , Joki\u0107 and Michael Porter Jr. were great together again last season and just need adequate help from their role players. It is also a nod to their late-game execution, which remains the best in the league and led to two wins over Boston last season.\n\nDenver Nuggets Elite 4-Man Lineup (2023-24)\n\nPlayers\n\nORTG\n\nDRTG\n\nNRTG\n\nMP\n\nJoki\u0107/Murray/Gordon/Porter Jr. Reg.

Washington away from hosting a Game 7 against Dallas, where they could have closed the deal.\n\nOKC addressed its weaknesses directly this offseason, adding Isaiah Hartenstein and Alex Caruso, trading Josh Giddey to the Chicago Bulls and retaining key young players Aaron Wiggins and Isaiah Joe.\n\nGiddey was a huge problem for the Thunder in last year's playoffs because of his inability to shoot as opposing teams would use his defender as another help guy, forcing OKC to play four-on-five offense.\n\nHis minutes were getting eaten up by Wiggins and Joe, the two players the Thunder re-signed.\n\nThey did a masterful job ridding themselves of Giddey by adding another terrific wing defender in Caruso, giving OKC yet another option to throw at the opponent's best ball handlers.\n\nThe Thunder also addressed their rebounding needs by adding a stud center in Hartenstein, which allows them to slide Chet Holmgren to the four and play a traditional lineup in certain matchups.\n\nThunder Rotation\n\nStarters\n\nBench\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander\n\nAlex Caruso\n\nJalen Williams\n\nIsaiah Joe\n\nLuguentz Dort\n\nAaron Wiggins\n\nChet Holmgren\n\nCason Wallace\n\nIsaiah Hartenstein\n\nJaylin Williams\n\nSimilar to New York, Oklahoma City offers endless amounts of wing athleticism and defense to throw at Boston, which seems to be the formula to contain the Celtics.\n\nThe Thunder can do this while maintaining their explosive offense, which just got much better this summer.\n\nRelated Thunder Solidified Their Status as Contenders With 3

Such was life for defensive guard Avery Bradley during his rookie year with the Boston Celtics in 2010.\n\nAlthough he was the 19th overall pick, he joined a Celtics team aiming for the NBA title after winning it all in 2008. With established players like Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen, and Paul Pierce already operating on the wing, there needed to be more room for the 6'3\" guard out of Texas on Boston's rotation.\n\nAccording to former Celtics great Kevin Garnett, Avery was once sent to the Celtics' G League affiliate, the Maine Celtics. He took that personally, and when the rookie guard returned, \"The Big Ticket\" shared how passionate Bradley was about staying in the NBA for good.\n\nKG's rook\n\nTalking on \"KG Certified,\" he recalled his first meeting with Avery Bradley.\n\n\"I'll never forget, he was sitting with Ellis on the training table, and I remember he had a dope haircut and some nice earrings. I was looking at him like, 'Who's this?' They said, 'Oh yeah, this is our little guard.' I thought, 'Is this guy a model or something?'\" KG shared.\n\nHowever, the Hall of Famer recounted that Bradley's suave appearance soon changed when he was sent to the G League.\n\n\"I think he hurt his ankle and wasn't playing well in camp, so he had to go to the G League. He was there for a week, and when he came back, his hair was knotty, he hadn't shaved, and he had a cut under his eye,\" the retired power forward revealed.\n\nWhile the G League is still part of the NBA, its operations differ from the NBA's. As Bradley quickly discovered, players there have different luxuries and resources than those in the NBA. This experience, however, only strengthened his resolve to make it in the big league.\n\nDetermined to stay in the big league\n\nWith the G League experience fresh in mind, Avery rejoined the Celtics and was determined to prove to the coaching staff that he was worthy of a spot in the rotation. KG bared that in one practice, Bradley had a look in his eye that showed he meant business. As Celtics center Kendrick Perkins soon discovered, that fire and determination translated into an unforgettable slam dunk.\n\n\"I'll never forget this. The first play of scrimmage, he rejected a screen, took two steps, and dunked on Perk so f*****g hard that we had to stop practice,\" the 15-time All-Star stated.\n\n\"You know what he said to me after the dunk?

Such was life for defensive guard Avery Bradley during his rookie year with the Boston Celtics in 2010.\n\nAlthough he was the 19th overall pick, he joined a Celtics team aiming for the NBA title after winning it all in 2008. With established players like Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen, and Paul Pierce already operating on the wing, there needed to be more room for the 6'3\" guard out of Texas on Boston's rotation.\n\nAccording to former Celtics great Kevin Garnett, Avery was once sent to the Celtics' G League affiliate, the Maine Celtics. He took that personally, and when the rookie guard returned, \"The Big Ticket\" shared how passionate Bradley was about staying in the NBA for good.\n\nKG's rook\n\nTalking on \"KG Certified,\" he recalled his first meeting with Avery Bradley.\n\n\"I'll never forget, he was sitting with Ellis on the training table, and I remember he had a dope haircut and some nice earrings. I was looking at him like, 'Who's this?' They said, 'Oh yeah, this is our little guard.' I thought, 'Is this guy a model or something?'\" KG shared.\n\nHowever, the Hall of Famer recounted that Bradley's suave appearance soon changed when he was sent to the G League.\n\n\"I think he hurt his ankle and wasn't playing well in camp, so he had to go to the G League. He was there for a week, and when he came back, his hair was knotty, he hadn't shaved, and he had a cut under his eye,\" the retired power forward revealed.\n\nWhile the G League is still part of the NBA, its operations differ from the NBA's. As Bradley quickly discovered, players there have different luxuries and resources than those in the NBA. This experience, however, only strengthened his resolve to make it in the big league.\n\nRelated: Kevin Durant says the Paris Dream Team is the deepest team he's played for: \"From top to bottom, everybody is the guy on their team\"\n\nDetermined to stay in the big league\n\nWith the G League experience fresh in mind, Avery rejoined the Celtics and was determined to prove to the coaching staff that he was worthy of a spot in the rotation. KG bared that in one practice, Bradley had a look in his eye that showed he meant business. As Celtics center Kendrick Perkins soon discovered, that fire and determination translated into an unforgettable slam dunk.\n\n\"I'll never forget this. The first play of scrimmage, he rejected a screen, took two steps, and dunked on Perk so f*****g hard that we had to stop practice,\" the 15-time All-Star stated.\n\n\"You know what he said to me after the dunk? 'I ain't going back. I ain't never going back,'\" KG stressed.\n\nThe G League isn't the worst thing. There are leagues far worse than the NBA's developmental league. However, Bradley believed in his heart of hearts that he belonged in the NBA. This belief fueled his relentless work, day in and day out, as he waited for his opportunity. And when it finally came, he didn't hesitate to make his mark.\n\nRelated: \"We damn near about to go to blows\" - Kendrick Perkins on how he and Kevin Garnett didn't talk for the first three weeks in Boston", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_panerio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jonas Panerio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avery Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Braves_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Braves men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajon_Rondo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajon Rondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ray Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/c6/1c6d7458-8644-50ae-9201-09e65148c488/668d1da74d840.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Barth grew up in the Boston area and began covering both the New England Patriots, Boston Celtics, and Boston Red Sox in 2017 before joining the Hub in 2020. He now covers all things Boston Sports for 985TheSportsHub.com as well as appearing on air. Alex writes about all New England sports, as well as college football. You can follow him across all social media platforms at @RealAlexBarth.\n\nIn this millennium, compiling a summary of Boston championships is something of a never-ending task. In that way, it's a little like home ownership. As soon as you finish one project, there always seems to be another.\n\nBut those are good problems to have.\n\nNow that the Celtics have dispatched the Dallas Mavericks for the 18th title in franchise history, it felt like a good time to revisit the city's historic run to the start of this millennium, during which Boston has now won 13 titles in 22 years, including at least one in each of the four major North American team sports. The Patriots, Red Sox, Celtics and Bruins have gone a collective 13-7 in final games/series, a winning percentage of .650 against what is, theoretically, the toughest competition in sports.\n\nTo this point, only the Bruins have failed to win multiple championships, though they did make three appearances in the Stanley Cup Final between 2011-2019.\n\nWhere you rank all these championships is entirely up to you, but suffice it to say that championships are truly like fingerprints, each possessing distinguishing characteristics. The most rewarding of those championships? You might say the 2004 Red Sox. The most heart-stopping? Probably the 2014 Patriots. In the wake of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the 2013 Red Sox title meant a great deal to the community. The 2011 Bruins run may have been the most rewarding.\n\nRegardless, each of the 13 had their own story, some (like the 2001 Patriots) associated with beginnings and others (like the 2018 Patriots) associated with endings.\n\nThese Celtics? Well, they could be both. Boston has been tracking toward this title for several years, after all, beginning when Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum each were selected with the third pick of consecutive NBA drafts.\n\nSince that time, the Celtics have played in six conference championships, bringing their total in this millennium to 10. (Boston teams overall have made a resounding 33 trips to the league semifinals in the 2000s - 13 for the Patriots, 10 for the Celtics, seven for the Red Sox and three for the Bruins.) And yet, now that Brown and Tatum have entered their peak years, one can't help but wonder if the duo is merely beginning their own championship era.\n\nToday, we stop asking if Tatum and Brown can win a championship together.\n\nAnd we start asking how many.\n\nLike we said, one project inevitably leads to another.\n\nA summary of Boston championships beginning with the Patriots' extraordinary title in 2001:", "source": {"uri": "985thesportshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.5 The Sports Hub - Boston's Home For Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBZ-FM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WBZ-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Marathon bombing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://985thesportshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2024/07/GettyImages-1524682762_1720460339_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

The C's have been plenty active re-signing their guys as that run continued Monday. The team announced it's signed guard JD Davison to a two-way contract.\n\nDavison, 21, was drafted 53rd overall by the Celtics back in 2022 out of Alabama. He's played on two-way deals for the past two seasons as he's developed his craft behind the scenes. The team's clearly happy with his progression as they'll bring back the third-year pro for another season with Boston.\n\n\"JD came out very young in the draft,\" C's assistant general manager Austin Ainge said. \"The last two years in Maine, he's really, really improved. We've loved his trajectory, and we think he still has room to grow. He's younger than the guys we just drafted and a lot of other guys who were drafted. We think he still has some growth. We're very optimistic.\"\n\nDavison will suit up for the Summer League Celtics for the third straight season, though he's more of the veteran now. Last season, Davison averaged 20.8 points, 5.4 rebounds and 8.6 assists in 28 games with the Maine Celtics, helping them to a G League Finals berth. So now, he'll look to continue improving as a pro as he's still plenty young.\n\nAs Ainge pointed out, Davison is still extremely young -- especially when compared to some of his peers. In this year's draft, the Celtics chose Baylor Scheierman at No. 30 and Anton Watson at No. 54. Both of those players enjoyed five-year college careers, so they're actually roughly two years older than Davison. So there's a plus for Davison as he continues his pro career.\n\nWith Davison signed, the Celtics are just about full on their roster. They currently have 14 of 15 normal roster spots already filled. They also signed wing Drew Peterson to a two-way deal, meaning two of their three slots are taken there. Watson is expected to sign a two-way deal himself, so the C's are almost at capacity when it comes to their roster.

Other front offices have been making some noise -- exhibit A: the Philadephia 76ers acquiring Paul George -- while on the other hand, the New York Knicks grabbed Mikal Bridges via trade.\n\nBoth teams aim to dethrone the Cs from the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Easier said than done, though.\n\nThe odds are being calculated simultaneously and for Boston, their odds stand tall above all.\n\n\"As the 76ers (+400) and Knicks (+450) hold the second- and third-best odds to win the East, the Celtics are ahead of the pack with +150 odds to win the conference on DraftKings Sportsbook as of (July 7),\" Boston.com's Conor Roche prefaced before saying, \"The Celtics' odds to win the conference have an implied probability of 40 percent and are similar to the odds they had to win the conference for much of last season.\"\n\nNumerically, the C's odds seem like an outlier compared to the 76ers' and Knicks' but do not let that steer you away from the fact they need to play the game of basketball to determine results.\n\nBanner No. 18 is secured but it does not stop there. Surely, Tatum and Jaylen Brown along with the entire organization want to keep the trend going and to keep it on the topic of odds -- they're at the very top.\n\nThere's no difference -- the Celtics are in a world of their own and it does no matter the setting. Whether it's in the front office, on the hardwood and within numbers -- it feels like they can not be defeated.\n\nAgain, odds at the end of the day do not play much of role -- they're subjective.\n\nWhat does matter is how Tatum, Brown, and the rest of the crew find a way to put the ball through the hoop.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikal_Bridges", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikal Bridges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4813,h_2707,x_0,y_75/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/18/01j29kea7n6tt3ga4g5f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713256", "eventUri": "eng-9713256", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 813, "textEnd": 819}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

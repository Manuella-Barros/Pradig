The former Lt. Governor of Georgia published a scintillating opinion piece in the Atlanta Constitution-Journal Monday. I give Geoff Duncan a lot of credit for having the guts to make a statement like this. He will have screaming MAGAs at his throat by nightfall, not the least of which will be the loony congresswoman with three toes, Marjorie Taylor Greene, from his own state. Duncan foresees a post Trump GOP and he wants to make that happen. So his solution is to \"vote for a decent person I disagree with on policy over a criminal defendant without a moral compass.\" Grow wings ketchup bottles, it's that or the wall, because you will be flying.\n\nIt's disappointing to watch an increasing number of Republicans fall in line behind former president Donald Trump. This includes some of his fiercest detractors, such as U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, who raised eyebrows during a recent interview by vowing to support the \"Republican ticket.\"\n\nThis mentality is dead wrong. [...]\n\nBut the GOP will never rebuild until we move on from the Trump era, leaving conservative (but not angry) Republicans like me no choice but to pull the lever for Biden. At the same time, we should work to elect GOP congressional majorities to block his second-term legislative agenda and provide a check and balance.\n\nThe alternative is another term of Trump, a man who has disqualified himself through his conduct and his character. The headlines are ablaze with his hush-money trial over allegations of improper record-keeping for payments to conceal an affair with an adult-film star.\n\nMost important, Trump fanned the flames of unfounded conspiracy theories that led to the horrific events of Jan. 6, 2021. He refuses to admit he lost the last election and has hinted he might do so again after the next one.\n\nDuncan is actually soft soaping here. We won't get \"another term\" of Trump, we will get a dictator in office who refuses to leave. 2024 could be our last election. Trump himself has alluded to the fact that he is \"owed\" another term because the 2020 election was \"stolen.\" America has never been on more dangerous ground than she stands on this election cycle. We have a criminal defendant running for office, not for one term but for keeps.\n\nThose holding their nose and falling behind Trump tend to rely on similar arguments. Sometimes it involves, as Barr stated in his CNN interview, the, \"duty to pick the person who I think would do the least damage to the country.\"\n\nIronically, having served as his attorney general until December 2020, Barr saw firsthand Trump's ability to cause damage. Barr's declaration that the U.S. Justice Department uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election infuriated his boss and set off a chain of events that ended with Jan. 6.\n\nTrump and his allies hatched cockamamie schemes that included fake slates of electors and have led to indictments (so far) in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia. They spread wild-eyed conspiracy theories that resulted in defamation lawsuits, including a $148 million verdict against former Trump lawyer and New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe situation is clearly out of control. And the yes men, like Barr, are falling in line but Duncan fails to state why: and that is, because they're as corrupt as Trump is. If they weren't, this situation never would have gotten as far as it has. The Republican party is fine with any lunatic in charge, as long as it can be in power and push its agenda. If that wasn't the truth, Trump would have never gotten where he did in the first place.\n\nI greatly respect Duncan's goal of wanting to move the GOP beyond Trump. The party needs to do that. I'm just thinking that it's too late, because I don't think principled Republicans (yes, I know it's an oxymoron) will vote for Biden. I think they'll vote for Trump again figuring hey, it's a chance on the roulette wheel and if the destruction of America results, oh well. We'll figure it out later.\n\nThe healing of the Republican Party cannot begin with Trump as president (and that's aside from the untold damage that potentially awaits our country). A forthcoming Time magazine cover story lays out in stark terms \"the outlines of an imperial presidency that would reshape America and its role in the world.\"\n\nUnlike Trump, I've belonged to the GOP my entire life. This November, I am voting for a decent person I disagree with on policy over a criminal defendant without a moral compass.\n\nAgain, it's laudable that Duncan wants to save his party and more importantly, do the right thing for his country. I take my hat off. The problem here is that Duncan's in the minority and the majority of Republicans want to follow Trump over the cliff, like lemmings. That said, assuming that Trump does lose in November, the GOP will once again have a decision to make and that will be: where do we go from here? It can't be Trump 2028, because he'll most likely be in prison then.\n\nNevertheless, it's a pretty wild world when a lifelong Republican and former office holder in a deep red state decides to come out in favor of the Democrat. This is how Trump has split asunder not only the GOP but the country at large.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, defended the integrity of the state's elections and condemned Trump's actions and rhetoric as false and undemocratic.\n\nThat break with Trump led Duncan to decide not to run for re-election in 2022 and to write a book about re-inventing the Republican Party without Trump.\n\nDuncan, who is also a former professional baseball player and state lawmaker, was recruited to join the centrist third-party presidential ticket backed by No Labels earlier this year, but he ultimately declined.\n\nThe deep-pocketed Washington group announced in March that it was abandoning its 2024 presidential ambitions after being unable to find a credible candidate. Duncan appears to be closest they came to securing a candidate for the top of the the ticket, though No Labels kept much of its work private.\n\nDuncan has since said in interviews that he seriously considered the No Labels ticket, but was not confident that any third-party candidate would have a real path to victory in November and worried he would merely be a spoiler.\n\nWith Trump now back atop the GOP and on track to be its nominee in November, Duncan criticized other erstwhile GOP skeptics of Trump for falling in line behind the former president instead of backing the current Democratic one.\n\n\"[T]he GOP will never rebuild until we move on from the Trump era, leaving conservative (but not angry) Republicans like me no choice but to pull the lever for Biden,\" Duncan wrote in his new op-ed.\n\n\"The alternative is another term of Trump, a man who has disqualified himself through his conduct and his character,\" he continued. \"The headlines are ablaze with his hush-money trial over allegations of improper record-keeping for payments to conceal an affair with an adult-film star.\"\n\nDuncan went on to write that he disagrees with Biden's policies and that Republicans who support Biden should simultaneously \"work to elect GOP congressional majorities to block his second-term legislative agenda and provide a check and balance.\"\n\nAnti-Trump Republicans were a key piece of the coalition that helped Biden oust the former president in 2020, when Democrats highlighting the support of GOP officials in ads and speaking slots at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nBut some of those same pro-Biden Republicans said the president's outreach since has been lackluster since then, warning that his campaign needs to do more to win over so-called soft Republicans and GOP-leaning independents.\n\nDemocrats closely watching this year's GOP primary also saw potential Biden supporters among the segment of voters won by former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, a moderate and Trump critic.\n\nBiden's team has yet to make a major public effort aimed specifically at those voters, but Democrats say the time for such a move would come closer to the election. In the meantime, they believe that Trump and his campaign will continue to denigrate Haley and her supporters, rather than try to win them back.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news",

Gov. Geoff Duncan in Atlanta in 2020.Alyssa Pointer / Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP file\n\nNot long ago, Geoff Duncan was seen as a rising star in GOP politics. Now, the former Georgia lieutenant governor says he's voting for President Joe Biden in 2024, and he's urging other Republicans to do so, too.\n\n\"Unlike Trump, I've belonged to the GOP my entire life. This November, I am voting for a decent person I disagree with on policy over a criminal defendant without a moral compass,\" Duncan wrote in an op-ed published Monday in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia was a breaking point for Duncan, who along with other state GOP officials, like Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, defended the integrity of the state's elections and condemned Trump's actions and rhetoric as false and undemocratic.\n\nThat break with Trump led Duncan to decide not to run for re-election in 2022 and to write a book about re-inventing the Republican Party without Trump.\n\nDuncan, who is also a former professional baseball player and state lawmaker, was recruited to join the centrist third-party presidential ticket backed by No Labels earlier this year, but he ultimately declined.\n\nThe deep-pocketed Washington group announced in March that it was abandoning its 2024 presidential ambitions after being unable to find a credible candidate. Duncan appears to be closest they came to securing a candidate for the top of the the ticket, though No Labels kept much of its work private.\n\nDuncan has since said in interviews that he seriously considered the No Labels ticket, but was not confident that any third-party candidate would have a real path to victory in November and worried he would merely be a spoiler.\n\nWith Trump now back atop the GOP and on track to be its nominee in November, Duncan criticized other erstwhile GOP skeptics of Trump for falling in line behind the former president instead of backing the current Democratic one.\n\n\"[T]he GOP will never rebuild until we move on from the Trump era, leaving conservative (but not angry) Republicans like me no choice but to pull the lever for Biden,\" Duncan wrote in his new op-ed.\n\n\"The alternative is another term of Trump, a man who has disqualified himself through his conduct and his character,\" he continued. \"The headlines are ablaze with his hush-money trial over allegations of improper record-keeping for payments to conceal an affair with an adult-film star.\"\n\nDuncan went on to write that he disagrees with Biden's policies and that Republicans who support Biden should simultaneously \"work to elect GOP congressional majorities to block his second-term legislative agenda and provide a check and balance.\"\n\nAnti-Trump Republicans were a key piece of the coalition that helped Biden oust the former president in 2020, when Democrats highlighting the support of GOP officials in ads and speaking slots at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nBut some of those same pro-Biden Republicans said the president's outreach since has been lackluster since then, warning that his campaign needs to do more to win over so-called soft Republicans and GOP-leaning independents.\n\nDemocrats closely watching this year's GOP primary also saw potential Biden supporters among the segment of voters won by former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, a moderate and Trump critic.\n\nBiden's team has yet to make a major public effort aimed specifically at those voters, but Democrats say the time for such a move would come closer to the election. In the meantime, they believe that Trump and his campaign will continue to denigrate Haley and her supporters, rather than try to win them back.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Yes, serious questions linger about President Biden's ability to serve until the age of 86. His progressive policies aren't to conservatives' liking.\"\n\nHe added: \"But the GOP will never rebuild until we move on from the Trump era, leaving conservative (but not angry) Republicans like me no choice but to pull the lever for Biden. At the same time, we should work to elect GOP congressional majorities to block his [Trump's] second-term legislative agenda and provide a check and balance.\"\n\nDuncan wrote that \"the healing of the Republican Party cannot begin with Trump as president\" and that come November he will be \"voting for a decent person I disagree with on policy over a criminal defendant without a moral compass.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to a spokesperson for Trump and a spokesperson for Biden's campaign via email for comment.\n\nThis is not the first time Duncan, now a CNN contributor, has spoken out against Trump. The former lieutenant governor infuriated Trump supporters after the 2020 election by refusing to back attempts to reverse the outcome in Georgia, later accusing the then-president of spreading \"10 weeks of misinformation.\" In May 2021, Duncan announced he wouldn't be standing for reelection in the 2022 midterms.\n\nThe former president was indicted in August 2023 by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis after an early January 2021 phone call he had with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking to \"find me 11,780 votes\" so he could be declared the winner in Georgia instead of Biden. Trump, meanwhile, has maintained his innocence in the case and said it is politically motivated.\n\nBiden narrowly won Georgia in 2020 and carried the state with 49.5 percent of the vote compared to Trump's 49.3 percent.\n\nBefore his indictment, Trump wrote last year on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Duncan should not testify to the grand jury in Fulton County and added, \"He refused having a Special Session to find out what went on, became very unpopular with Republicans (I refused to endorse him!), and fought the TRUTH all the way.\"\n\nAfter testifying before the grand jury, Duncan told reporters that if Republicans want to win in 2024, they need to dump Trump and find a new candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, Duncan spoke to CNN in 2021 about the call between Trump and Raffensperger saying that \"it was inappropriate.\"\n\nDuncan voted for Trump over Biden in the 2020 election and told CNN that he was \"disappointed\" by the call and praised Raffensperger's responses.\n\n\"I was proud to hear his voice, I was proud to hear his answers, although they weren't what the President wanted to hear or anybody else on that side of the call wanted to hear,\" he said to the news outlet at the time.\n\nSome of Trump's former officials and Cabinet members have appeared to move away from the former president, refusing to endorse his second run for the presidency. In an interview with Fox News earlier this year, former Vice President Mike Pence said: \"It should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years, and that's why I cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_impelli@newsweek.com", "name": "Matthew Impelli", "type": "author",

Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election results there, endorsed President Biden for re-election on Monday.\n\n\"I am voting for a decent person I disagree with on policy over a criminal defendant without a moral compass,\" Mr. Duncan wrote in an opinion piece in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nHe joins a small minority of prominent Republicans who have deemed Mr. Trump's conduct -- especially his refusal to accept his loss -- egregious enough to set aside party loyalty and refuse to vote for him. Mr. Duncan also cited Mr. Trump's \"erratic\" handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his \"incendiary\" public statements for his reasoning.\n\nThe list of other prominent Republicans who say they will not vote for him is short. It includes former Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah, and former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Even fewer Republicans -- among them the former Trump spokeswoman Sarah Matthews and the former White House lawyer Ty Cobb -- have gone a step further and said they would vote for Mr. Biden, as opposed to a third-party or write-in candidate.\n\nArguing that \"elections are a binary choice,\" Mr. Duncan wrote: \"The G.O.P. will never rebuild until we move on from the Trump era, leaving conservative (but not angry) Republicans like me no choice but to pull the lever for Biden. At the same time, we should work to elect G.O.P. congressional majorities to block his second-term legislative agenda and provide a check and balance.\"\n\n\"The alternative,\" he wrote, \"is another term of Trump, a man who has disqualified himself through his conduct and his character.\"\n\nMr. Duncan criticized Republicans who have fallen in line behind Mr. Trump, a majority of the party that includes many who previously spoke against him. Mr. Duncan cited three by name: Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader; Bill Barr, Mr. Trump's former attorney general; and Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire.\n\nJames Singer, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said it \"welcomes and is actively reaching out to Americans like Geoff Duncan, who put their country and concern for protecting our democracy before blind loyalty to Donald Trump and his self-centered campaign of revenge and retribution.\" A spokesman for Mr. Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlongside Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, Mr. Duncan affirmed Mr. Biden's victory in Georgia in 2020 and condemned the efforts by Mr. Trump and his allies to overturn it. \"The mountains of misinformation are not helping the process; they are only hurting it,\" he told CNN that December. \"I voted for President Trump. I campaigned for him.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA lifetime member of the Republican party and former lieutenant governor of Georgia has revealed he will be voting for Joe Biden this November after heavily criticizing presumed rival Donald Trump and warning of the threat he poses to the presidency.\n\nGeoff Duncan announced on Monday that he will be voting for Mr Biden despite being critical of the Democrat for years.\n\nMr Duncan was lieutenant governor of Georgia between 2019 and 2023, during the period when Mr Trump allegedly tried to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election in the state. Mr Trump is facing 10 charges related to election interference in Georgia.\n\nIn a piece for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, titled \"Why I'm voting for Biden and other Republicans should, too\", Mr Duncan said that the \"mentality\" of Republicans falling in line behind Donald Trump is \"dead wrong.\"\n\n\"Yes, elections are a binary choice. Yes, serious questions linger about President Biden's ability to serve until the age of 86.

He did, after all, get a decent number of Republican endorsements in 2020; on the first evening of the Democratic convention in Milwaukee, four of them spoke: former Ohio governor John Kasich, former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman, former New York congresswoman Susan Molinari, and former California gubernatorial nominee and business executive Meg Whitman. And there are obviously a lot of Republican or ex-Republican voices shouting down Trump; you can find a lot of them at the Bulwark any given day.\n\nBut even in 2020, it was noteworthy how very former the most prominent Republicans for Biden were. The two (unrelated) Whitmans were last on a ballot for elected office in 2010 (Meg) and 1997 (Christine). Then and now, actual Republican officeholders, whatever their opinion of the 45th president, have almost entirely put on the party harness or at least kept their mouths shut. But even among ex-officeholders, new recruits to the Republicans-for-Biden camp this year are few and far between, as NBC News recently reported:\n\nAllies of President Joe Biden are ramping up a charm offensive aimed at getting high-profile Republicans and donors who won't support Donald Trump to back the Democratic president.\n\nBut the task is proving difficult, according to people familiar with the efforts.\n\nAs of Thursday [April 4], Biden had not yet secured any endorsements from nationally recognized Republican Party officials.\n\nNBC reports Team Biden is hoping against hope that two high-profile 2024 Trump rivals will eventually climb onboard the incumbent's bandwagon: Chris Christie and Nikki Haley. I'd say the former is a very long shot (thanks to his many nasty comments about Biden) and the latter is a fantasy (because she is far from ruling out a future in the GOP). The White House can probably count on a formal nod from Liz Cheney at some point between now and November. But given her role on the January 6 Committee, and her rather forceful defenestration by Wyoming Republicans in a 2022 primary, Cheney wouldn't much count as a defection.\n\nAt this point, Joe Biden's prize convert among active Republicans is former Georgia lieutenant governor Geoff Duncan, who endorsed the president in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution's op-ed published Monday:\n\n[T]he GOP will never rebuild until we move on from the Trump era, leaving conservative (but not angry) Republicans like me no choice but to pull the lever for Biden ...\n\nThe alternative is another term of Trump, a man who has disqualified himself through his conduct and his character. The headlines are ablaze with his hush-money trial over allegations of improper record-keeping for payments to conceal an affair with an adult-film star.\n\nMost important, Trump fanned the flames of unfounded conspiracy theories that led to the horrific events of Jan. 6, 2021. He refuses to admit he lost the last election and has hinted he might do so again after the next one.\n\nIf you aren't from Georgia but Duncan's name rings a bell, it's probably because he was the last cookie on the plate for the nonpartisan organization No Labels before it gave up on running a presidential ticket this year. When even Duncan ultimately said \"no\" to No Labels, it was a pretty sure sign it just wasn't going to be its year.\n\nDuncan, as it happens, was one of several prominent Georgia Republicans who favored certification of Biden's victory in the state in 2020 and then called out Trump's efforts to overturn the results. Unlike Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, however, Duncan didn't follow through by fighting the vengeful attempted MAGA takeover of the GOP in 2022. Instead, he dropped his reelection bid and let Trump ally (and false elector) Burt Jones have the state's No. 2 position, even as Kemp and Raffensperger defeated Trump's surrogates handily in a Republican primary.\n\nInterestingly, Duncan didn't call out Kemp (who had endorsed Trump's 2024 reelection bid) and Raffensperger (who seems to be trying to mend fences with the 45th president) in criticizing Republicans who are \"holding their noses and falling behind Trump\"; he scolds by name such conveniently out-of-state GOP-ers as Mitch McConnell, Chris Sununu, and Bill Barr. Presumably Duncan foresees some sort of Georgia Republican future for himself, which likely motivates this awkward comment that couldn't have been pleasing to Team Biden: \"At the same time [as we support Biden], we should work to elect GOP congressional majorities to block his second-term legislative agenda and provide a check and balance.\"\n\nPerhaps the Republican voters that Democratic operatives covet in November won't need role models from the political class. If they do, they might want a shinier trophy than Geoff Duncan. And Duncan might want to reconsider his belief that the GOP is moving his way.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_kilgore@nymag.com",

Gov. Geoff Duncan urged his fellow Republicans to vote against the party's presumptive presidential standard bearer Donald Trump and back President Biden instead.\n\nDuncan, 49, who was in office during Trump's 2020 election machinations in the Peach State, voiced his deep dismay at top Republicans coalescing around Trump, 77.\n\n\"This mentality is dead wrong,\" he wrote in an op-ed for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Monday. \"GOP will never rebuild until we move on from the Trump era, leaving conservative (but not angry) Republicans like me no choice but to pull the lever for Biden.\"\n\nThe former lieutenant governor stressed his desire to see the GOP lock down majorities in both chambers of Congress to scuttle Biden's second-term agenda.\n\nHe then rattled through familiar grievances with Trump such as the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, election denialism, as well as his \"conduct and his character.\"\n\n\"I get it. No one likes paying higher taxes, and these protests are unsettling,\" Duncan wrote. \"Trump has shown us who he is. We should believe him. To think he is going to change at the age of 77 is beyond improbable.\"\n\nSince his ascension to power in the Republican Party, Trump has managed to overpower scores of GOP critics and even win many of them over.\n\nTrump has taken shots at Duncan in the past and called him a \"failed\" lieutenant governor last year. In August of 2023, Trump suggested that Duncan shouldn't testify before the Fulton County probe investigating the 2020 election.\n\nThe 45th president faces a now-10 count indictment out of Fulton County for alleged 2020 election tampering in Georgia. He has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty.\n\nDuncan appeared to flirt with No Labels, a group that explored the possibility of recruiting a candidate outside the duopoly to compete with the Republican and Democrat presidential nominees.\n\nUltimately, he declined an invitation to helm the party and No Labels has since announced it wouldn't crown a standard bearer in the 2024 cycle.\n\nDuncan also made waves in 2022 when he announced that he wouldn't vote for either incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) or Republican former football star Herschel Walker in the midterm elections.\n\nDespite his penchant for bucking convention, Duncan describes himself as a true Republican.\n\n\"Unlike Trump, I've belonged to the GOP my entire life. This November, I am voting for a decent person I disagree with on policy over a criminal defendant without a moral compass,\" he added.\n\nThe Post contacted the Trump campaign for comment.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign wasted little time promoting Duncan's op-ed, lauding him, and emphasizing that the president is welcoming disgruntled Republicans to his camp.\n\n\"Our campaign welcomes and is actively reaching out to Americans like Geoff Duncan, who put their country and concern for protecting our democracy before blind loyalty to Donald Trump and his self-centered campaign of revenge and retribution,\" campaign spokesperson James Singer said.\n\n\"Lt. Governor Duncan and those who share his values of preserving American democracy, standing up for the rule of law, treating each other with decency and dignity and respect, and working to find common ground have a place in President Biden's vision for America.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

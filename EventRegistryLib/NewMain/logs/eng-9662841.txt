Lauren Boebert's lead-up to her 2024 reelection campaign was nothing short of disastrous, and yet the pistol-packing, theater-vaping, district-hopping Republican is still the candidate to beat.\n\nA poll released earlier this month by Florida-based Kaplan Strategies shows 40% of voters surveyed plan to support Ms. Boebert in the June 25 primary race to represent Colorado's 4th Congressional District. None of her five GOP rivals drew more than 5%.\n\nDick Wadhams, former Colorado Republican Party chairman and a GOP political consultant, said he believes the congresswoman's actual support may be slightly below 40%, but that she's still the clear frontrunner.\n\n\"I don't know if it's 40, but I do believe she's at least in the 30s, and in that large field -- there are six candidates total -- it really does work to her favor with her name-ID advantage,\" Mr. Wadhams said. \"And she's got a pretty big financial advantage, too. I think those two things really benefit her.\"\n\nGiven that the CD4 is the most conservative in the state -- 58% of the district voted for Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential race versus 39% for Democrat Joe Biden -- the winner of the GOP primary becomes the instant favorite to win the general election in November.\n\nThat Ms. Boebert leads the field just months after moving to the new district -- and after a year of calamitous headlines centered on her personal life -- speaks to the power of name recognition and fundraising in a crowded field, as well as the willingness of voters to forgive and forget.\n\nMs. Boebert announced in December that she would switch from the 3rd to the 4th Congressional District after eking out a meager 546-vote win in 2022 against Democrat Adam Frisch, who has raised a whopping $13 million in his bid to capture the Western Colorado seat in November.\n\nShe moved 230 miles from Rifle to Windsor to run for the seat vacated by Republican Ken Buck, who retired in March.\n\nTrailing Ms. Boebert was skepticism over whether her cowgirl-in-heels image would translate to the CD4, which includes the rural Eastern Plains but also the prosperous suburbs of Douglas County and sections of suburban Weld and Larimer counties.\n\nThe Kaplan poll also found that 40% of Republican and unaffiliated voters are undecided, meaning that her opponents have a path to the nomination if they can distinguish themselves as her chief rival, something none of them has so far been able to do.\n\nAlso seeking the GOP nod are Logan County Commissioner Jerry Sonnenberg; former state House Minority Leader Mike Lynch; state Rep. Richard Holtorf; former talk-show host Deborah Flora; and conservative activist Peter Yu.\n\nMr. Sonnenberg, who served previously in the state legislature, won the coveted endorsements of former Republican Sens. Cory Gardner, Wayne Allard and Hank Brown, but Ms. Boebert snared the biggest of all, that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nHer opponents have taken shots at her effectiveness in Congress and her district-switching in recent televised debates, as well as incidents in her personal life.\n\n\"We've seen how Lauren Boebert would represent us, abandoning her neighbors in CD3, missing key votes while chasing cameras, and being in the center of D.C. drama instead of delivering real solutions for the people,\" said Ms. Flora, former conservative talk-show host on KNUS-AM and founder of Parents United America, at the May 29 debate on CBS4.\n\nIn September, Ms. Boebert was caught on camera vaping and being groped by her date during a performance at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts (DCPA). At first she denied vaping, then apologized after video footage showed she did, saying she didn't recall doing so.\n\nAfter Mr. Lynch made reference at the May 30 debate on 9News to the \"theater incident,\" Ms. Boebert was asked by the moderator whether she wanted to \"talk about the theater thing.\"\n\n\"I certainly have owned up to my night out in Denver. I've gone on that public apology tour and I'm grateful for the mercy and grace that has been shown, but I'm not going to continue to live life in shame and be beat up on this,\" Ms. Boebert said.\n\nNot helping is her ongoing family drama.\n\nEx-husband Jayson Boebert accepted a plea deal last week after being charged in January with assault stemming from two domestic altercations in January.\n\nHer oldest son Tyler Boebert, now 19, was charged with felony theft after being arrested in February over a \"string of vehicle trespass and property thefts in Rifle,\" according to Rifle police.\n\nMr. Wadhams said that \"all those things in terms of liabilities are going to be problems for her in those suburban areas.\"\n\n\"They don't like the DCPA fiasco,\" he said. \"They don't like the standing up at the State of the Union and yelling at the president. All that stuff. She's going to win, but I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't win by nearly the margin she should.\"\n\nMs. Boebert has sought to rehabilitate her image with the help of strong fundraising. Her campaign has raised about $4 million, while no other Republican has collected more than $500,000, according to the latest Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nThat cash advantage has allowed her to run TV ads aimed at appealing to suburban women, including a spot in which her youngest son Roman Boebert offers her tips on what to include in her next campaign commercial.\n\n\"That's easy, Mom. Why don't you just tell them about how you carry your gun and always fight for freedom?\" asks the boy.\n\nMs. Boebert responds with a smile: \"Well, I think they already know that.\"\n\nBallots dropped June 3 in the Colorado all-mail election. A special election to fill the remainder of Mr. Buck's term is also being held June 25, and that race pits Democrat Trisha Calvarese against Republican Greg Lopez.", "source": {"uri":

She was first elected in 2020 to Colorado's 3rd Congressional District but announced late last year plans to switch districts to the 4th Congressional District in the rural, right-leaning eastern part of the state as well as some more competitive Denver suburbs.\n\nBoebert said she changed districts for personal reasons, but the move came after she narrowly won in her current district during the 2022 midterms, despite the district generally being viewed as having a Republican lean.\n\nShe is facing several challengers but remains favored to win next Tuesday, polls show.\n\nNew campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) ahead of the primary delivered more good news for Boebert. The reports cover the two months leading up to the primary, from April 1 to June 5. During that time, Boebert raised about $332,935 -- far more than the other candidates, according to the reports.\n\nRadio host Deborah Flora raised $70,213, state Representative Richard Holtorf raised $10,150, former Colorado House Minority Leader Mike Lynch raised $54,057, former state Senator Jerry Sonnenberg raised $43,695 and banker Peter Yu raised $225.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Boebert's campaign for comment via email.\n\nThroughout the primary season, Boebert has also raised more money from within the state of Colorado than her rivals, according to FEC data. She has raised 597,691 from Colorado voters to Flora's $276,691, Sonnenberg's $284,862, Holtorf's $100,050 and Yu's $33,730.\n\nOutside of Colorado, Boebert received the most donations from Texas ($225,362), Florida ($158,309) and California ($108,399) through the end of March, according to FEC data.\n\nA May 31 Kaplan Strategies poll, conducted among 343 likely voters, found that 40 percent of respondents plan to back Boebert, while her closest rival, Yu, received only 5 percent support.\n\nBoebert benefits from having high name recognition, as she has been popular with conservative voters who make up the primary electorate, and receiving the endorsement of former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\nRepublicans are generally favored in the 4th District, viewed as the most conservative in Colorado. However, some polls suggest the general election in November could be close. A Democratic-sponsored poll in May found her trailing Democrat Ike McCorkle, though no non-partisan polling has been conducted.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The move did, however, put her into a more competitive primary than she would have faced in her old district.\n\nOn June 25, Ms. Boebert will face the GOP primary voters at her new district for the first time, and most indicators suggest that she's poised to win the competition.\n\nA late May Kaplan Strategies survey of 343 likely voters in the district found that she had 40 percent support in the six-way primary while her closest competitor, businessman Peter Yu, only had 5 percent support.\n\nMs. Boebert has also significantly out-fundraised her opponents, bringing in about $2 million for her campaign, according to the latest Federal Elections Commission filings. Her best-funded opponent, conservative radio host Deborah Flora, has only raised about $418,000.\n\nMs. Boebert's strong positioning in the primary comes despite -- or perhaps because of -- her penchant for making headlines and her position as one of the loudest voices on the GOP's right fringe in the House.\n\nSome of Ms. Boebert's drama that has garnered attention over the course of her campaign include the arrest of her son on charges of vehicle trespass and theft and the removal of her and her date from a performance of \"Beetlejuice\" early this year.\n\nMs. Boebert was removed from the \"Beetlejuice\" performance for singing, vaping, and using a cell phone during the performance. Video of the incident that surfaced after it became public depicted the congresswoman and her date groping each other suggestively during the performance.\n\nSome of Ms. Boebert's opponents have attempted to make hay on Ms. Boebert's numerous scandals. State Senator Jerry Sonnenberg has stated repeatedly that the district needs a \"work horse, not a show horse.\"\n\n\"Integrity and character in my neck of the woods is vital,\" Mr. Sonnenberg said at a debate. \"If you're looking for someone that wants to be on TV, I'm not it. If you want somebody that's a work horse, and not a show horse, that's me.\"\n\nOther of Ms. Boebert's opponents have also attacked her for her decision to switch districts, or for the lack of major legislation that Republicans have passed during Ms. Boebert's time in Congress. Any opposition to Ms. Boebert has, however, failed to coalesce around a single candidate.\n\nAlso helping Ms. Boebert in her Republican primary is the endorsement of President Trump, who said she \"is a Proven Conservative and Effective Leader.\"\n\nIf Ms. Boebert is victorious next week, she could still face a competitive election in November -- the very thing she sought to avoid by switching districts.\n\nHer likely Democratic opponent, state Representative Ike McCorkle, has been touting a survey conducted for his campaign by Gravis Marketing, which found that Mr. McCorkle led Ms. Boebert 38 percent to 31 percent, with 30 percent undecided.\n\nThe same survey also found that the same respondents preferred Trump to President Biden, 44 percent to 29 percent, suggesting that there are some voters in the district who might consider voting split ticket this year.\n\nIn reference to the potential general election matchup Mr. McCorkle tells the Sun \"our campaign continues to show that we have the message and resources to take on Lauren Boebert in November.\"\n\n\"Our momentum continues to grow, and we out raised Lauren Boebert for the second filing period in a row,\" Mr. McCorkle says. \"These numbers send a clear message that Americans across the political spectrum want Lauren Bobert out of Congress.\"\n\nWhether or not the results of the Gravis Marketing survey would hold up through the election is not clear. Surveys this far from the election tend not to be predictive of final results, and there has been no public polling of the district.\n\nNeither Ms. Boebert nor Mr. McCorkle immediately responded to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_payne@nysun.com", "name": "Russell Payne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Boebert", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lauren Boebert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States House of Representatives elections in California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Frisch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Frisch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beetlejuice (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Sonnenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Sonnenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-ticket_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split-ticket voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geomatics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geomatics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lauren-Boebert.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662841", "eventUri": "eng-9662841", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 816, "textEnd": 823}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Matt \"Giggity\" Gaetz who remains embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct-and Rep. Gaetz's fast friend on the back benches of the U.S. House, Colorado's own Rep. Lauren Boebert.\n\nRep. Boebert, who appears to be successfully carpetbagging herself a third term in a much more Republican leaning district, clearly believes she has lived down her ejection from Denver's Buell Theater for engaging in publicly inappropriate sexual behavior last fall. In the aftermath of that scandal, Boebert conducted what she herself calls an \"apology tour,\" and made promises to her then-constituents on the Western Slope to keep her private life out of the headlines.\n\nNow that Boebert is headlining \"Hot Girl Summer,\" it looks like Boebert is leaning into the salacious side of her reputation. The fact that neither of Boebert's co-hosts are members of Congress makes her participation stand out, and not in a good way for the institution. If we were advising Boebert, we'd be adamantly against her headlining this event. Boebert may be on the verge of a \"fresh start\" few would have predicted last fall, but if she wants to be taken seriously in that reinvention this is not the way to do it.\n\nThen again, and we have to seriously consider the possibility at this point, maybe this is kind of thing Boebert wants to be known for.", "source": {"uri": "coloradopols.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Pols"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Girl_Summer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hot Girl Summer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Republicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Young Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Boebert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lauren Boebert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Performing_Arts_Complex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Performing Arts Complex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carpetbagger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Reviews", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.coloradopols.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hotgirlsummer-650x650.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662841", "eventUri": "eng-9662841", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

But the 59-year-old had politics on his mind as he stepped down from a massive tractor at his ranch on the state's eastern plains. After a brief oration on the deficiencies of battery-powered farming equipment, Mr Holtorf explained why he was running in the Republican primary and hoping subsequently to win a seat in the House of Representatives.\n\nAfter gaining legislative experience as minority whip in the state House, Mr Holtorf has developed a desire to influence policy at a higher level. And then there is Lauren Boebert. \"She hasn't done anything except run her mouth and showboat and carry a pistol around, and showboat some more,\" he argues. Ms Boebert -- who before entering politics ran Shooters Grill in Rifle, Colorado -- first defeated a Republican incumbent in 2020, despite expressing sympathy for the non conspiracy theory.\n\nHer frequent television appearances, high-profile political feuds with fellow Republicans and a warm relationship with Donald Trump have made her one of the most recognisable figures on Capitol Hill. The 37-year-old grandmother was kicked out of a musical in Denver last year after vaping and fondling her date, increasing her notoriety, and maybe her appeal.\n\nVoters in Colorado's third congressional district, which preferred Mr Trump over Joe Biden by a mere five points in 2020, grew tired of this stuff. Set for a rematch this year with a well-funded Democratic opponent, and after winning reelection by only 546 votes in 2022, Ms Boebert opted to run in the more heavily Republican fourth district. Armed with Mr Trump's endorsement and unrivalled name recognition, she is the frontrunner.\n\nA recent survey conducted by Kaplan Strategies, a political consultancy, showed her favoured by 40% of the primary electorate, and her opponents winning between 3% and 5%. Perhaps this is not surprising in a district with a highway billboard that declares . Other candidates questioned the Kaplan survey's size, and insisted that they had met few real voters who supported Ms Boebert, but still acknowledged her strong position.\n\nSitting in a cluttered conference room at his metal foundry in Loveland, about an hour north of Denver, Mike Lynch offers this assessment of her. \"If she was an incredibly effective legislator, and then has a weird life, I don't care.\" The former state house minority leader contrasts this with his own work on issues like fire prevention, which doesn't get much attention on social media. Mr Lynch predicts that Republicans would lose the fourth congressional district with Ms Boebert as their nominee -- something the party has managed only once in the past half-century.\n\nMs Boebert, of course, is not the only candidate with flaws. Asked at a debate in January whether they had ever been arrested, six of the then nine candidates raised their hands. Several candidates described ultimately failed efforts to consolidate the field. According to Peter Yu, a businessman and perennial candidate,\"There were other candidates in the race who refused, no matter what the situation was, to ever drop out.\" Ms Boebert raised $332,935 between April 1st and June 5th -- several times more than her nearest competitor. She has campaigned in the district and frequently attacks her opponents as members of the \"uniparty\". In the unlikely event of an upset on June 25th, she could indeed point to a uniparty being responsible: unaffiliated voters are allowed to vote in either party's primaries, and Ms Boebert is widely reviled outside the party base. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nLauren Boebert shot to fame with her gun-themed restaurant Shooters Grill, where waitresses served customers flouting loaded firearms in hip holsters - and tourists increasingly flocked as the MAGA Republican's profile rose.\n\nThat Shooters, in the appropriately named town of Rifle, shut down two years ago, just as Boebert has begun closing the chapter on the constituency where it's located and where she's the incumbent. Rather than seeking re-election in the 3rd congressional district, Boebert abandoned ship to run in a new constituency eastward - and as luck would have it, there's another Shooters there.\n\nBoebert has no connection to this sleeker restaurant almost 275 miles away in Byers. Shooters Bar & Grill serves alcohol, unlike Boebert's venture -- probably wise, considering the firearms, which the new Shooters is also missing. Also highlighting their differences: the new Shooters has not had any bad press for skirting Covid rules (having only opened last June) nor reports of food poisoning.\n\nThe Byers Shooters, however, does get the odd Boebert-themed question.\n\n\"We've had people ask about it,\" general manager Tiffany Engelsman tells The Independent just over a week before the June 25 primary - which will decide whether Boebert gets the GOP nomination for the seat in the 4th congressional district -- although she notes it's \"definitely not\" a common occurrence.\n\nPolling earlier this month placed Boebert with a 35-point lead over five other candidates, though 40% of voters were undecided at the time, according to the Kaplan Strategies poll.\n\nBoebert announced in December that she would no longer pursue a re-election campaign in CD3, where she narrowly beat Democrat Adam Frisch two years ago by just 546 votes. At the time of the switch announcement, many voters in the eastern plains - a more heavily rural and conservative agricultural district - were not hugely familiar with Boebert, despite her national presence.\n\nWhile some of CD4 touches the edges of Denver's commuter suburbs, most communities are small, close-knit and rural, home to farms producing crops like wheat, corn and oats as well as dairy and hog operations, and livestock ranches. The district stretches to the Kansas border and is considered Colorado's agricultural heartland, a cultural world away from liberal Denver and the state's ski towns.\n\nFamiliarity with Boebert and her voting record has increased since December as word trickled out, says constituent Michele Wingo, shopping at the Byers General Store just down the street from the town's Shooters.\n\n\"I just know she fights for us and fights for our rights,\" she tells The Independent.\n\n\"I love what she did up there,\" she adds, referring to Boebert's old constituency. \"I was like, 'Oh, I wish she was down here.'\"\n\nNext week's primary will determine how many other voters share the sentiments of Wingo, who also works at the store's pharmacy and overhears local gossip - which tends to focus more on the national scene than local.\n\n\"They just talk about the president,\" Wingo says. \"They don't talk about anybody else.\"\n\nShe'd been hoping to stop at Boebert's former restaurant Shooters on the way to drive her daughter to college in Grand Junction, on the other side of the state - but was sad to learn the business had closed. (Her daughter, who is old enough to vote, was unfamiliar with Boebert.)\n\nThe space on Rifle's Main Street, which used to be filled with guns and Second-Amendment-themed paraphernalia beside cardboard Trump cutouts, has been replaced by a Mexican eatery.\n\nAnd it remains to be seen how much of a mark Boebert will leave on this new constituency, where the Republican primary is heavily crowded and where rancour remains about her carpet-bagging move.\n\n\"Lauren Boebert doesn't know CD4. She doesn't know this district, its constituents, or its strengths and challenges,\" Republican State Sen. Byron Pelton and his wife wrote this month in a letter to the Sterling Journal-Advocate endorsing rival Jerry Sonnenberg in the primary.\n\n\"She hopes that by spending her massive marketing budget (primarily earned from her previous district), that you will vote for her because you have been inundated with her advertising materials ... We've had people tell us they are voting for Boebert because 'she's a fighter' and 'she's not afraid to get on TV and speak her mind.'\n\n\"We would ask you to consider that being an effective legislator is much more than being loud and being on TV.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

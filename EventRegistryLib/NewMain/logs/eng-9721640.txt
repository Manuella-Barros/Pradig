Climate Summit, Saturday, Dec. 9, 2023, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. A mass trial in the United Arab Emirates of dissidents that has faced widespread criticism abroad ended Wednesday July [...]\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A mass trial in the United Arab Emirates of dissidents that was widely criticized abroad sentenced 43 people to life in prison Wednesday, while others received other prison terms, authorities said.\n\nThe sentences given by the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal came in a case described by the UAE government as involving the Muslim Brotherhood, a pan-Islamic organization declared a terrorist group by the Emirates. Activists, however, decried the case as targeting dissidents, something that drew attention and protests at the United Nations COP28 climate talks held in Dubai in November.\n\nThe state-run WAM news agency reported the verdicts after human rights activists said the sentences had been handed down. Five defendants received 15-year sentences while five others received 10-year sentences. Another 24 defendants had their cases dismissed, WAM reported.\n\n\"These over-the-top long sentences make a mockery of justice and are another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society,\" said Joey Shea, a researcher focusing on the UAE for Human Rights Watch. \"The UAE has dragged scores of its most dedicated human rights defenders and civil society members through a shamelessly unfair trial riddled with due process violations and torture allegations.\"\n\nThe Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, a group run by an Emirati who lives in exile in Istanbul, separately reported that sentences had been handed down.\n\nAmnesty International also criticized the sentences, saying the defendants had \"been held in prolonged solitary confinement, deprived of contact with their families and lawyers and subjected to sleep deprivation through continuous exposure to loud music.\" Those tried also were \"forbidden from receiving the most basic court documents,\" it said.\n\n\"The trial has been a shameless parody of justice and violated multiple fundamental principles of law, including the principle that you cannot try the same person twice for the same crime, and the principle that you cannot punish people retroactively under laws that didn't exist at the time of the alleged offense,\" said Devin Kenney, an Amnesty International researcher.\n\nKenney described some of those tried as \"prisoners of conscience and well-known human rights defenders.\"\n\nWAM did not identify those sentenced. But among those who received life sentences is activist Nasser bin Ghaith, an academic held since August 2015 over his social media posts, Shea said.\n\nHe was among dozens of people sentenced in the wake of a wide-ranging crackdown in the UAE following the 2011 Arab Spring protests. Those demonstrations saw Islamists, including Brotherhood member Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, rise to power in several Mideast nations.\n\nThe Gulf Arab states did not experience any popular overthrow of their governments and cracked down against demonstrators and those perceived to be dissenters.\n\nAlso among those who were likely sentenced Wednesday is Ahmed Mansoor, the recipient of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2015. Mansoor repeatedly drew the ire of authorities in the UAE by calling for a free press and democratic freedoms in the federation of seven sheikhdoms.\n\nMansoor was targeted with Israeli spyware on his iPhone in 2016 likely deployed by the Emirati government ahead of his 2017 arrest and sentencing to 10 years in prison over his activism.\n\nDuring COP28, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch held a demonstration in which they displayed Mansoor's face in the U.N.-administered Blue Zone at the summit in a protest carefully watched by Emirati officials.\n\nThe UAE, while socially liberal in many regards compared with its Middle Eastern neighbors, has strict laws governing expression and bans political parties and labor unions. That was seen at COP28, where there were none of the typical protests outside of the venue as activists worried about the country's vast network of surveillance cameras.", "source": {"uri":

Five defendants received 15-year sentences while five others received 10-year sentences. Another 24 defendants had their cases dismissed, WAM reported.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe court ruled that those convicted \"have worked to create and replicate violent events in the country, similar to what has occurred in other Arab states -- including protests and clashes between the security forces and protesting crowds -- that led to deaths and injuries and to the destruction of facilities, as well as the consequent spread of panic and terror among people,\" WAM said.\n\nThe agency reported on no specific evidence the court cited tying those convicted to violence or the Brotherhood.\n\nThe verdict, which can be appealed to the UAE's Federal Supreme Court, drew immediate criticism abroad.\n\n\"These over-the-top long sentences make a mockery of justice and are another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society,\" said Joey Shea, a researcher focusing on the UAE for Human Rights Watch. \"The UAE has dragged scores of its most dedicated human rights defenders and civil society members through a shamelessly unfair trial riddled with due process violations and torture allegations.\"\n\nThe Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, an advocacy group in exile, separately reported that sentences had been handed down.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Regrettably, these sentences were entirely foreseeable,\" center director Mohamed al-Zaabi said. \"From the outset, it was clear that this trial was merely a facade designed to perpetuate the detention of prisoners of conscience even after their sentences had been served.\"\n\nAmnesty International also criticized the sentences, saying the defendants had \"been held in prolonged solitary confinement, deprived of contact with their families and lawyers and subjected to sleep deprivation through continuous exposure to loud music.\" Those tried also were \"forbidden from receiving the most basic court documents,\" it said.\n\n\"The trial has been a shameless parody of justice and violated multiple fundamental principles of law, including the principle that you cannot try the same person twice for the same crime, and the principle that you cannot punish people retroactively under laws that didn't exist at the time of the alleged offense,\" said Devin Kenney, an Amnesty International researcher.\n\nKenney described some of those tried as \"prisoners of conscience and well-known human rights defenders.\"\n\nWAM did not identify those sentenced.

A verdict is expected July 10.\n\n\"We hope that before you sentence us to death, you will give us the opportunity to defend ourselves,\" implored Sheikh Muhammad al-Siddiq, an Emirati political dissident, during a March court hearing.\n\nPublic scrutiny on this case is necessary for these defendants to have any hope for freedom. The silence of the international community - now and over the last decade - has led us to where we are now: 84 of the UAE's brightest civil society members are at risk of losing their voices forever.\n\nThe trial has been characterized by t fair trial and due process violations. Emirati authorities have restricted access to case material and information, shrouded the hearings in secrecy, and violated the principle of double jeopardy - an international legal rule that prohibits trying people twice for the same offense after they had received a final verdict. Judges have brazenly directed witness testimony. Most disturbingly, defendants have repeatedly described abusive detention conditions such as physical assaults, forced nudity, and prolonged solitary confinement that would amount to torture.\n\nEmirati authorities announced the mass trial in December 2023 as the eyes of the world were on the UAE during the COP28 climate summit in Dubai: The timing was shocking, during an international meeting in the UAE that was promised to be \"the most inclusive ever held.\"\n\nThe bold timing can be chalked up to the impunity the UAE has enjoyed over the last decade. Despite the country's continuing crackdown on political dissidents and civil society, few, if any, governments have dared to criticize the country's rights record. The UAE has become a key security ally for many governments and has fostered strong economic ties.\n\nThe new trial can trace its origins back to the 2013 \"UAE94\" mass trial of political dissidents, where an Abu Dhabi court sentenced 69 defendants to between 5 and 15 years in prison on charges related to their political activism.\n\nMost of the defendants from the 2013 trial are being tried in the new case on nearly identical charges, even after having served their full sentences. Emirati human rights defenders believe the authorities brought the new case to keep the dissidents detained indefinitely - there is little hope for an alternative outcome unless allied governments speak out.\n\nDiplomatic missions expressed some concern over the UAE's crackdown on civil and political rights in 2011 and 2013. In 2013, international institutions at least attempted to send observers to the trial. No embassy has sent monitors to observe trial proceedings to our knowledge.\n\nBut limited scrutiny was quickly traded for stronger economic and security relationships. Human rights groups have been pushing for sustained attention on the case for years, but instead silence has prevailed. This silence has led to Emirati state security authorities becoming emboldened and acting with greater impunity.\n\nThe UAE has long leveraged its economic and security relationships to prevent public criticism of its human rights record, but now the silence from the UAE's western allies is nearly absolute. More than a decade on from the UAE94 trial, the silence from the UAE's partners is total. During my recent trip to the UAE, diplomatic missions told me that public expression of concern for the fair trial violations we documented was out of the question; even private engagement was highly unlikely.\n\nAll governments concerned with human rights, particularly close security and economic allies of the UAE, should publicly condemn the trial's abuses and send monitors to the July 10 session.\n\nSustained public attention and pressure may have led to the release of the UAE94 defendants upon completion of their sentences.

A verdict is expected July 10.\n\n\"We hope that before you sentence us to death, you will give us the opportunity to defend ourselves,\" implored Sheikh Muhammad al-Siddiq, an Emirati political dissident, during a March court hearing.\n\nPublic scrutiny on this case is necessary for these defendants to have any hope for freedom. The silence of the international community - now and over the last decade - has led us to where we are now: 84 of the UAE's brightest civil society members are at risk of losing their voices forever.\n\nEmirati authorities announced the mass trial in December 2023 as the eyes of the world were on the UAE during the COP28 climate summit in Dubai: The timing was shocking, during an international meeting in the UAE that was promised to be \"the most inclusive ever held.\"\n\nThe bold timing can be chalked up to the impunity the UAE has enjoyed over the last decade. Despite the country's continuing crackdown on political dissidents and civil society, few, if any, governments have dared to criticize the country's rights record. The UAE has become a key security ally for many governments and has fostered strong economic ties.\n\nThe new trial can trace its origins back to the 2013 \"UAE94\" mass trial of political dissidents, where an Abu Dhabi court sentenced 69 defendants to between 5 and 15 years in prison on charges related to their political activism.\n\nMost of the defendants from the 2013 trial are being tried in the new case on nearly identical charges, even after having served their full sentences. Emirati human rights defenders believe the authorities brought the new case to keep the dissidents detained indefinitely - there is little hope for an alternative outcome unless allied governments speak out.\n\nDiplomatic missions expressed some concern over the UAE's crackdown on civil and political rights in 2011 and 2013. In 2013, international institutions at least attempted to send observers to the trial. No embassy has sent monitors to observe trial proceedings to our knowledge.\n\nBut limited scrutiny was quickly traded for stronger economic and security relationships. Human rights groups have been pushing for sustained attention on the case for years, but instead silence has prevailed. This silence has led to Emirati state security authorities becoming emboldened and acting with greater impunity.\n\nThe UAE has long leveraged its economic and security relationships to prevent public criticism of its human rights record, but now the silence from the UAE's western allies is nearly absolute. More than a decade on from the UAE94 trial, the silence from the UAE's partners is total. During my recent trip to the UAE, diplomatic missions told me that public expression of concern for the fair trial violations we documented was out of the question; even private engagement was highly unlikely.\n\nAll governments concerned with human rights, particularly close security and economic allies of the UAE, should publicly condemn the trial's abuses and send monitors to the July 10 session.\n\nSustained public attention and pressure may have led to the release of the UAE94 defendants upon completion of their sentences. Instead, the case was lost to political expediency and the new case was announced.\n\nWhile the 2013 trial was covered extensively by the international press, the new case has barely made headlines. A few dedicated and brave outlets that have closely followed the trial, often at great personal risk to staff, but many more have not. Reporters following the trial could face travel bans, intimidation and deportation.\n\nIf neither the foreign press nor the diplomatic community provide the necessary scrutiny, the 84 may be condemned to suffer for many more years on July 10.", "source": {"uri": "ipsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "IPS Inter Press Service - Global News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dissident"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_activists", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human rights activists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights in China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2019/04/logo-ips_155.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721640", "eventUri": "eng-9721640", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 376, "textEnd": 383, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Those demonstrations saw Islamists, including Brotherhood member Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, rise to power in several Mideast nations.\n\nThe Gulf Arab states did not experience any popular overthrow of their governments and cracked down against demonstrators and those perceived to be dissenters.\n\nAlso among those who were likely sentenced Wednesday is Ahmed Mansoor, the recipient of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2015. Mansoor repeatedly drew the ire of authorities in the UAE by calling for a free press and democratic freedoms in the federation of seven sheikhdoms.\n\nMansoor was targeted with Israeli spyware on his iPhone in 2016 likely deployed by the Emirati government ahead of his 2017 arrest and sentencing to 10 years in prison over his activism.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDuring COP28, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch held a demonstration in which they displayed Mansoor's face in the U.N.-administered Blue Zone at the summit in a protest carefully watched by Emirati officials.\n\nThe UAE, while socially liberal in many regards compared with its Middle Eastern neighbors, has strict laws governing expression and bans political parties and labor unions.

But among those who received life sentences is activist Nasser bin Ghaith, an academic held since August 2015 over his social media posts, Shea said.\n\nHe was among dozens of people sentenced in the wake of a wide-ranging crackdown in the UAE following the 2011 Arab Spring protests. Those demonstrations saw Islamists, including Brotherhood member Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, rise to power in several Mideast nations.\n\nThe Gulf Arab states did not experience any popular overthrow of their governments and cracked down against demonstrators and those perceived to be dissenters.\n\nAlso among those who were likely sentenced Wednesday is Ahmed Mansoor, the recipient of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2015. Mansoor repeatedly drew the ire of authorities in the UAE by calling for a free press and democratic freedoms in the federation of seven sheikhdoms.\n\nMansoor was targeted with Israeli spyware on his iPhone in 2016 likely deployed by the Emirati government ahead of his 2017 arrest and sentencing to 10 years in prison over his activism.\n\nDuring COP28, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch held a demonstration in which they displayed Mansoor's face in the UN-administered Blue Zone at the summit in a protest carefully watched by Emirati officials.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

The court dismissed the cases of 24 defendants.\n\nAccording to WAM, the court ruled that those convicted \"have worked to create and replicate violent events in the country, similar to what has occurred in other Arab states -- including protests and clashes between the security forces and protesting crowds -- that led to deaths and injuries and to the destruction of facilities, as well as the consequent spread of panic and terror among people.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal on Wednesday via email for comment.\n\nWhile WAM did not identify those sentenced by name, and specific details regarding the trial are not clear, Joey Shea, a researcher focusing on the UAE for Human Rights Watch, noted a few prominent figures involved in the case to the Associated Press (AP).\n\nAmong those sentenced to life is Nasser bin Ghaith, an academic detained since August 2015 over social media posts. Prominent activist Ahmed Mansoor, known for advocating for free press and democratic freedoms, is also believed to be among those sentenced.\n\nThe AP wrote that Mansoor, who won the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2015, was previously sentenced to 10 years in prison for his activism.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, the breakdown of the known defendants can be seen with \"93 percent or (67 out of 72) who were already tried on the same accusations in the last mass trial in 2012-2013. Nearly half (34 out of 72) are signatories of the March 2011 pro-democracy petition that set the UAE authorities on their current repressive course. The overwhelming majority (83%, 60 out of 72) were already being detained beyond the expiry of their sentences from the previous mass trial.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Amnesty International via email on Wednesday for comment.\n\nIn response to the sentencing, both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International condemned the verdicts.\n\n\"These over-the-top long sentences make a mockery of justice and are another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society. The UAE has dragged scores of its most dedicated human rights defenders and civil society members through a shamelessly unfair trial riddled with due process violations and torture allegations,\" Shea said to the AP.\n\nAmnesty International called for the immediate release of the defendants, adding that the trial violated \"fundamental principles of law.\"\n\n\"The UAE must urgently revoke this unlawful verdict and immediately release the defendants. The trial has been a shameless parody of justice and violated multiple fundamental principles of law, including the principle that you cannot try the same person twice for the same crime, and the principle that you cannot punish people retroactively under laws that didn't exist at the time of the alleged offense,\" Devin Kenney, Amnesty International's UAE Researcher, said in a statement.\n\nKenney added: \"Trying 84 Emiratis at once, including 26 prisoners of conscience and well-known human rights defenders is a scarcely disguised exercise in punishing dissenters that has been further marred by a myriad of fair trial violations, the most serious of which is uninvestigated allegations of torture and other ill-treatment.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

On July 10, 2024, the Abu Dhabi Federal Appeals Court meted out sentences ranging from between 15 years to life in prison in the UAE's second largest unfair mass trial.\n\nIn December 2023, while hosting the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), Emirati authorities brought charges against at least 84 defendants in retaliation for forming an independent advocacy group in 2010, many of whom had already been serving prison sentences for the same or similar offenses. The unfair mass trial was marred by serious due process and fair trial violations, including restricted access to case material and information, limited legal assistance, judges directing witness testimony, violations of the principle of double jeopardy, credible allegations of serious abuse and ill-treatment, and hearings shrouded in secrecy.\n\n\"These over-the-top long sentences make a mockery of justice and are another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society,\" said Joey Shea, United Arab Emirates researcher at Human Rights Watch. \"The UAE has dragged scores of its most dedicated human rights defenders and civil society members through a shamelessly unfair trial riddled with due process violations and torture allegations.\"\n\nGiven that the charges are based solely on defendants' peaceful practice of their human rights, UAE authorities should immediately overturn these convictions and release all defendants, the groups said.\n\nAmong the 44 defendants whose conviction is known, 4 people were sentenced to 15 years in prison and 40 to life in prison, according to the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, a human rights organization supporting imprisoned human rights defenders in the UAE.\n\nThree of those sentenced to life in prison are an academic, Nasser bin Ghaith, Abdulsalam Darwish al-Marzouqi, and Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi. At least one defendant was acquitted. The verdicts for many of the defendants are not yet known as the authorities have yet to release official details about the convictions and sentences.\n\nIn a statement released on January 6, Emirati authorities accused the 84 defendants of \"establishing and managing a clandestine terrorist organization in the UAE known as the 'Justice and Dignity Committee'.\" The charges appear to come from the UAE's abusive 2014 counterterrorism law, which sets out punishments of up to life in prison and even death for anyone who sets up, organizes, or runs such an organization.\n\nAt least 60 of the defendants were already convicted in 2013 for their involvement with the Justice and Dignity Committee, according to the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, including al-Marzouqi and al-Qasimi. That raises concerns that Emirati authorities are violating the principle of double jeopardy, which prohibits trying people twice for the same offense after they had received a final verdict.\n\nThe prosecutor did not provide any new evidence, and the evidence cited in the hearings was based entirely on the UAE94 trial, the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center said. \"It is the same case as 2013,\" a relative of one defendant told Human Rights Watch. \"There is no new evidence, and it is the same allegations.\"\n\nIn 2013, the grossly unfair \"UAE94\" trial resulted in convictions of 69 critics of the government, including 8 in absentia, on charges that violated their rights to free expression, association, and assembly. The 69 critics were among 94 people detained beginning in March 2012 in a wave of arbitrary arrests amid an unprecedented crackdown on dissent.\n\nIn addition to defendants from the UAE94 case, prominent activists such as Ahmed Mansoor, who is on the Board of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) and the MENA Division Advisory Committee for Human Rights Watch, and academic Dr. Nasser bin Ghaith were put on trial in the new UAE84 case.\n\nUAE security forces arrested Ahmed Mansoor in a late-night house raid on March 20, 2017. In May 2018, the Abu Dhabi Court of Appeals' State Security Chamber sentenced Mansoor to 10 years in prison on charges entirely related to his human rights activities. On December 31, 2018, the court of last resort, the Federal Supreme Court, upheld his unjust sentence. In 2017, the Abu Dhabi Court of Appeals sentenced Nasser bin Ghaith, a prominent Emirati academic, to 10 years in prison on charges related to his peaceful criticism of the Egyptian and Emirati authorities.\n\n\"Regrettably, these sentences were entirely foreseeable. From the outset, it was clear that this trial was merely a fa\u00e7ade designed to perpetuate the detention of prisoners of conscience even after their sentences had been served,\" said Mohamed Al-Zaabi, director of the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center. \"This trial not only violates the principle of double jeopardy but also contravenes all forms of legal norms.\"\n\nFamily members have also expressed concern about the partiality of the presiding judge. During a hearing on December 21, one family member said, the judge \"put sentences in the mouth of the witness.\" The judge interrupted and intervened during the testimony by correcting the witness and dictating statements to him, family members and the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center said. The Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center said that at one point a police officer handed the witness a paper, which the witness then used to answer the remaining questions.\n\nThe trial was shrouded in secrecy, and Emirati authorities prevented defendants' lawyers from freely accessing case files and court documents. Lawyers have apparently not obtained physical or electronic copies of the court documents and were only able to view the documents on a screen in a secure room under the supervision of security officers. Lawyers were not allowed to take photos of the documents and were only permitted to take handwritten notes.\n\nWhile the January 6 statement from the Emirates News Agency (WAM), the UAE's official state news agency, claimed the case was \"public,\" Emirati authorities severely restricted access to the hearings, even for family members, and kept basic details of the case secret, including the names of all the defendants.\n\nMany of the defendants have been held in incommunicado solitary confinement for nearly a year. Phone calls and family visits have been prohibited from between 10 months to a year, except for brief phone calls in December 2023, informing family members of the existence of the new case and instructing them to hire lawyers.\n\nDuring the trial, defendants have repeatedly described abusive detention conditions, including physical assaults, lack of access to medical care and required medicines, incessant loud music, and forced nudity.\n\nEmirati authorities have not investigated the alleged abusive conditions, nor held those responsible for any unlawful acts to account.\n\nThe UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (also known as the Nelson Mandela Rules) state that \"solitary confinement shall be used only in exceptional cases as a last resort, for as short a time as possible and subject to independent review, and only pursuant to the authorization by a competent authority.\" The UN special rapporteur on torture has said that indefinite and prolonged solitary confinement in excess of 15 days should also be subject to an absolute prohibition, citing scientific studies that have established that even a few days of social isolation cause irreparable harm, including lasting psychological damage.\n\n\"It is a real tragedy that so many activists and human rights defenders will remain in prison for decades, deprived of watching their children grow up, for no other reason than calling for a better future for Emiratis,\" said Khalid Ibrahim, the Gulf Center for Human Rights's executive director. \"The authorities must release them immediately if they want to retain the respect of the international community.\"", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Human Rights Watch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On 10 July 2024, the Abu Dhabi Federal Appeals Court meted out sentences ranging from between 15 years to life in prison in the UAE's second largest unfair mass trial.\n\nIn December 2023, while hosting the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), Emirati authorities brought charges against at least 84 defendants in retaliation for forming an independent advocacy group in 2010, many of whom had already been serving prison sentences for the same or similar offenses. The unfair mass trial was marred by serious due process and fair trial violations, including restricted access to case material and information, limited legal assistance, judges directing witness testimony, violations of the principle of double jeopardy, credible allegations of serious abuse and ill-treatment, and hearings shrouded in secrecy.\n\n\"These over-the-top long sentences make a mockery of justice and are another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society,\" said Joey Shea, United Arab Emirates researcher at Human Rights Watch. \"The UAE has dragged scores of its most dedicated human rights defenders and civil society members through a shamelessly unfair trial riddled with due process violations and torture allegations.\"\n\nGiven that the charges are based solely on defendants' peaceful practice of their human rights, UAE authorities should immediately overturn these convictions and release all defendants, the groups said.\n\nAmong the 44 defendants whose conviction is known, four people were sentenced to 15 years in prison and 40 to life in prison, according to the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, a human rights organization supporting imprisoned human rights defenders in the UAE.\n\nThree of those sentenced to life in prison are academic Dr. Nasser Bin Ghaith, Abdulsalam Darwish Al-Marzouqi, and Sultan Bin Kayed Al-Qasimi to life imprisonment. At least one defendant was acquitted. The verdicts for many of the defendants are not yet known as the authorities have yet to release official details about the convictions and sentences.\n\nIn a statement released on 06 January 2024, Emirati authorities accused the 84 defendants of \"establishing and managing a clandestine terrorist organisation in the UAE known as the 'Justice and Dignity Committee'.\" The charges appear to come from the UAE's abusive 2014 counterterrorism law, which sets out punishments of up to life in prison and even death for anyone who sets up, organises, or runs such an organisation.\n\nAt least 60 of the defendants were already convicted in 2013 for their involvement with the Justice and Dignity Committee, including Al-Marzouqi and Al-Qasimi, according to the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center. That raises concerns that Emirati authorities are violating the principle of double jeopardy, which prohibits trying people twice for the same offense after they had received a final verdict.\n\nThe prosecutor did not provide any new evidence, and the evidence cited in the hearings was based entirely on the UAE94 trial, the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center said. \"It is the same case as 2013,\" a relative of one defendant told Human Rights Watch. \"There is no new evidence and it is the same allegations.\"\n\nIn 2013, the grossly unfair \"UAE94\" trial resulted in convictions of 69 critics of the government, including eight in absentia, on charges that violated their rights to free expression, association, and assembly. The 69 critics were among 94 people detained beginning in March 2012 in a wave of arbitrary arrests amid an unprecedented crackdown on dissent.\n\nIn addition to defendants from the UAE94 case, prominent activists such as Ahmed Mansoor, who is on the Board of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) and the MENA Division Advisory Committee for Human Rights Watch, and academic Dr. Nasser bin Ghaith were put on trial in the new UAE84 case.\n\nUAE security forces arrested Ahmed Mansoor in a late-night house raid on 20 March 2017. In May 2018, the Abu Dhabi Court of Appeals' State Security Chamber sentenced Mansoor to 10 years in prison on charges entirely related to his human rights activities. On 31 December 2018, the court of last resort, the Federal Supreme Court, upheld his unjust sentence. In 2017, the Abu Dhabi Court of Appeals sentenced Nasser bin Ghaith, a prominent Emirati academic, to 10 years in prison on charges related to his peaceful criticism of the Egyptian and Emirati authorities.\n\n\"Regrettably, these sentences were entirely foreseeable. From the outset, it was clear that this trial was merely a fa\u00e7ade designed to perpetuate the detention of prisoners of conscience even after their sentences had been served,\" said Mohamed Al-Zaabi, Director of the Emirates Detainees Advocacy. \"This trial not only violates the principle of double jeopardy but also contravenes all forms of legal norms.\"\n\nFamily members have also expressed concern about the partiality of the presiding judge. During a hearing on 21 December 2024, one family member said, the judge \"put sentences in the mouth of the witness.\" The judge interrupted and intervened during the testimony by correcting the witness and dictating statements to him, family members and the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center said. The Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center said that at one point a police officer handed the witness a paper, which the witness then used to answer the remaining questions.\n\nThe trial was shrouded in secrecy, and Emirati authorities prevented defendants' lawyers from freely accessing case files and court documents. Lawyers have apparently not obtained physical or electronic copies of the court documents and were only able to view the documents on a screen in a secure room under the supervision of security officers. Lawyers were not allowed to take photos of the documents and were only permitted to take handwritten notes.\n\nWhile the 06 January statement from the Emirates News Agency (WAM), the UAE's official state news agency, claimed the case was \"public,\" Emirati authorities severely restricted access to the hearings, even for family members, and kept basic details of the case secret, including the names of all the defendants.\n\nMany of the defendants have been held in incommunicado solitary confinement for nearly a year. Phone calls and family visits have been prohibited from between 10 months to a year, except for brief phone calls in December 2023, informing family members of the existence of the new case and instructing them to hire lawyers.\n\nDuring the trial, defendants have repeatedly described abusive detention conditions, including physical assaults, lack of access to medical care and required medicines, incessant loud music, and forced nudity.\n\nEmirati authorities have not investigated the alleged abusive conditions, nor held those responsible for any unlawful acts to account.\n\nThe UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (also known as the Nelson Mandela Rules) state that \"solitary confinement shall be used only in exceptional cases as a last resort, for as short a time as possible and subject to independent review, and only pursuant to the authorisation by a competent authority.\" The UN special rapporteur on torture has said that indefinite and prolonged solitary confinement in excess of 15 days should also be subject to an absolute prohibition, citing scientific studies that have established that even a few days of social isolation cause irreparable harm, including lasting psychological damage.\n\n\"It is a real tragedy that so many activists and human rights defenders will remain in prison for decades, deprived of watching their children grow up, for no other reason than calling for a better future for Emiratis,\" said Khalid Ibrahim, the Gulf Centre for Human Rights' Executive Director. \"The authorities must release them immediately if they want to retain the respect of the international community.\"", "source": {"uri": "ifex.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFEX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marianna_tzabiras@ifex.org", "name":

Trying 84 Emiratis at once, including 26 prisoners of conscience and well-known human rights defenders is a scarcely disguised exercise in punishing dissenters that has been further marred by a myriad of fair trial violations, the most serious of which is uninvestigated allegations of torture and other ill-treatment.\n\nThe trial has been a shameless parody of justice and violated multiple fundamental principles of law\n\n\"Defendants have been held in prolonged solitary confinement, deprived of contact with their families and lawyers and subjected to sleep deprivation through continuous exposure to loud music. The defendants and their families, including the families who have hired and are paying exorbitant legal fees for their defence lawyers, are forbidden from receiving the most basic court documents, and family members have repeatedly been denied entrance to the courtroom to observe trial sessions. It is not just the verdict, but the whole case that makes a mockery of the rule of law.\n\n\"This case should be the nail in the coffin of the UAE's attempts to disguise its horrendous human rights abuses behind a progressive fa\u00e7ade.\"\n\nBackground\n\nAuthorities launched the new mass trial during COP28, the international climate gathering held in Dubai last year, charging 84 defendants with establishing a \"terrorist organization\" and supporting and funding this organization. The case had been ongoing since 7 December 2023, yet the UAE only acknowledged the trial was taking place a month after human rights groups and journalists first uncovered and reported it.\n\nThe indictment, the charges, the defence lawyers, and even the names of defendants have been kept secret by the government, and are known only partially through leaks. Of the known defendants, 93% (67 out of 72) were already tried on the same accusations in the last mass trial in 2012-2013. Nearly half (34 out of 72) are signatories of the March 2011 pro-democracy petition that set the UAE authorities on their current repressive course. The overwhelming majority (83%, 60 out of 72) were already being detained beyond the expiry of their sentences from the previous mass trial.", "source": {"uri": "amnesty.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amnesty International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiratis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emiratis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_activists", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights activists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_conscience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of conscience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solitary confinement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sleep deprivation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1549749449-1-1024x735.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721640", "eventUri": "eng-9721640", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-03-", "textStart": 2640, "textEnd": 2650}], "sentiment": -0.6862745098039216, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The state news agency did not cite specific incidents or other evidence.\n\nThe verdicts against the 53 defendants can be appealed. The court meanwhile dismissed cases against 24 defendants and acquitted one, the state news agency said.\n\nJoey Shea, UAE researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that the harsh prison terms made a \"mockery of justice\", adding: \"The UAE has dragged scores of its most dedicated human rights defenders and civil society members through a shamelessly unfair trial riddled with due process violations and torture allegations.\"\n\nMohamed al-Zaabi, director of the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Centre, described the trial as a \"facade\".\n\nThe UAE does not tolerate dissent. It argues a tough stance on security protects it from the political instability and violence that has affected many of its Middle East neighbours, helping the UAE to cement its position as the region's centre for business and tourism.\n\nBut human rights groups have insisted the mass trial damaged the UAE's progressive image, and raised concerns about how justice was carried out.\n\nThey say the legal process has been shrouded in secrecy, that lawyers for the defendants have not had proper access to evidence, and that some prisoners have been held in solitary confinement.", "source":

Its local affiliate, the al-Islah party, is also banned.\n\nAccording to the official WAM news agency, on Wednesday the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal \"sentenced 43 defendants to life imprisonment for the crime of creating, establishing, and managing a terrorist organisation\".\n\nIn addition to the 43 life sentences handed out, 10 other defendants were jailed for 10 to 15 years in prison on the charges of \"co-operating with al-Islah\" and money laundering, WAM said.\n\nOne defendant was acquitted and 24 cases were ruled inadmissible, it added.\n\nThe bulk of the defendants have been in prison for more than a decade after they were jailed as part of the \"UAE 94\" trial in 2013, according to HRW and Amnesty International.\n\nMany had already completed their sentences.\n\nBut UAE authorities said the latest charges were \"materially distinct\" from those brought in 2013, which did not include accusations of financing a \"terrorist organisation\", AFP news agency reported.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, the indictment, charges, defence lawyers and names of defendants were \"kept secret by the government\".\n\nIt said details were only known through \"leaks\".\n\nHRW identified three of those sentenced to life in prison were Nasser bin Ghaith, Abdulsalam Darwish al-Marzouqi and Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi. Prominent activist Ahmed Mansoor was among the defendants, it added.\n\nReacting to the sentencings, Amnesty International's Devin Kenney urged the UAE to \"urgently revoke this unlawful verdict\" and called on those sentenced to be released.\n\n\"The trial has been a shameless parody of justice and violated multiple fundamental principles of law, including the principle that you cannot try the same person twice for the same crime, and the principle that you cannot punish people retroactively under laws that didn't exist at the time of the alleged offence.\"\n\nKhalid Ibrahim of the Gulf Center for Human Rights, on whose board Ahmed Mansoor sits, said: \"It is a real tragedy that so many activists and human rights defenders will remain in prison for decades, deprived of watching their children grow up, for no other reason than calling for a better future for Emiratis.\"\n\nDespite being one of the wealthiest countries in the Middle East and promoting high-tech sectors and innovations, the UAE remains restrictive on political activity.\n\nThe federation of seven emirates, which include Abu Dhabi and Dubai, has no official opposition and bans political parties.\n\nIn 2013, almost 70 Islamists were given jail sentences over an alleged plot to overthrow the government.", "source": {"uri": "en.armradio.am", "dataType": "news", "title": "Public Radio of Armenia"},

(Representational)\n\nDubai:\n\nA court in the United Arab Emirates has handed life sentences to 43 Emiratis for \"terrorist\" links, state media said Wednesday, after a mass trial heavily criticised by UN experts and rights groups.\n\nGovernment critics and human rights activists were among the 84 defendants brought before the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal, most of whom have been in jail since a similar trial of 94 people in 2013, according to rights groups.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi court \"sentenced 43 defendants to life imprisonment for the crime of creating, establishing, and managing a terrorist organisation\" linked to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, the official WAM news agency said.\n\nTen others were jailed for 10-15 years, WAM said, with one defendant acquitted and 24 cases ruled inadmissible. It did not give details of the remaining cases.\n\nDefendants can still appeal the verdicts before the Federal Supreme Court.\n\nThe trial, which kicked off in December, has been condemned by rights groups and United Nations experts who accuse the oil-rich Gulf monarchy of cracking down on dissent.\n\nMost of the defendants have already been in prison for more than a decade since the \"UAE 94\" trial 11 years ago, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International.\n\nBut UAE authorities say the latest charges are \"materially distinct\" from those brought in 2013, which did not include accusations of financing a \"terrorist organisation\".\n\n- 'Violent events' -\n\nThe UAE has not named the 84 defendants but the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, a UK-based watchdog, has identified more than 70 people, most of them already imprisoned.\n\nThe latest verdict makes a \"mockery of justice\", said Joey Shea, HRW's UAE researcher, calling it \"another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society\".\n\nAmong those sentenced to life in prison is Emirati academic Nasser bin Ghaith who has been held since August 2015 over social media posts, according to Shea.\n\nRenowned human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor who has been held since 2017 is also likely among thos convicted, though the details of his sentence remain unclear, Shea said.\n\nAmnesty International called it a \"shameless parody of justice,\" alleging fair trial violations.\n\n\"Trying 84 Emiratis at once, including 26 prisoners of conscience and well-known human rights defenders is a scarcely disguised exercise in punishing dissenters,\" said Devin Kenney, Amnesty's UAE Researcher.\n\nThe UAE has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWAM said the court had \"guaranteed the defendants all their rights\".\n\nThe report said they were trying to \"create and replicate violent events\" that would have left \"dead and injured in the squares and streets\".\n\n- 'Deeply regressive' -\n\nThe UAE, a federation of seven absolute monarchies, prohibits criticism of its rulers and any speech that is deemed to create or encourage social unrest.\n\nDefamation as well as verbal and written insults, whether published or made privately, are crimes punishable by fines and imprisonment.\n\nIn 2012, in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring revolts across the Middle East, the UAE launched a spate of arrests and prosecutions targeting dozens of Emirati dissidents who demanded political reform.\n\nAbout 60 of the \"UAE 94\" put on trial then remain behind bars for alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that is outlawed in the Gulf state.\n\nIn a letter sent to UAE authorities in January, independent UN experts said they were concerned that the latest proceedings against the 84 defendants reflect \"a broader pattern of suppression of dissent and civil society in the UAE\".\n\nThey questioned \"alleged irregularities\" such as \"the use of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment to extract forced confessions\".\n\nBen Saul, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, said the latest charges \"relate to the same conduct for which many of these defendants were tried the first time around a decade ago\".\n\nThe trial was a \"deeply regressive step\" and a \"terrible example of the misuse of counter-terrorism measures against civil society\", he told an expert panel hosted by the Geneva Press Club in March.\n\nLast week, HRW said many of the defendants have been kept incommunicado for at least a year and have reported abuses including physical assault, lack of access to medicine, incessant loud music and forced nudity.\n\nThe wealthy country's allies, including the United States, Britain and the European Union, should speak out about the \"unfair mass trial\", HRW said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"Emirati authorities have long used their country's economic and security relationships to prevent criticism of its rights record, but rarely, if ever, has the silence from its allies been so deafening,\" said HRW's Shea.\n\n(Except for the

It did not give details of the remaining cases.\n\nDefendants can still appeal the verdicts before the Federal Supreme Court.\n\nThe trial, which kicked off in December, has been condemned by rights groups and United Nations experts who accuse the oil-rich Gulf monarchy of cracking down on dissent.\n\nMost of the defendants have already been in prison for more than a decade since the \"UAE 94\" trial 11 years ago, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International.\n\nBut UAE authorities say the latest charges are \"materially distinct\" from those brought in 2013, which did not include accusations of financing a \"terrorist organisation\".\n\n'Violent events'\n\nThe UAE has not named the 84 defendants but the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, a U.K.-based watchdog, has identified more than 70 people, most of them already imprisoned.\n\nThe latest verdict makes a \"mockery of justice\", said Joey Shea, HRW's UAE researcher, calling it \"another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society\".\n\nAmong those sentenced to life in prison is Emirati academic Nasser bin Ghaith who has been held since August 2015 over social media posts, according to Ms. Shea.\n\nRenowned human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor who has been held since 2017 is also likely among thos convicted, though the details of his sentence remain unclear, Ms. Shea said.\n\nAmnesty International called it a \"shameless parody of justice,\" alleging fair trial violations.\n\n\"Trying 84 Emiratis at once, including 26 prisoners of conscience and well-known human rights defenders is a scarcely disguised exercise in punishing dissenters,\" said Devin Kenney, Amnesty's UAE Researcher.\n\nThe UAE has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWAM said the court had \"guaranteed the defendants all their rights\".\n\nThe report said they were trying to \"create and replicate violent events\" that would have left \"dead and injured in the squares and streets\".\n\n'Deeply regressive'\n\nThe UAE, a federation of seven absolute monarchies, prohibits criticism of its rulers and any speech that is deemed to create or encourage social unrest.\n\nDefamation as well as verbal and written insults, whether published or made privately, are crimes punishable by fines and imprisonment.\n\nIn 2012, in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring revolts across the Middle East, the UAE launched a spate of arrests and prosecutions targeting dozens of Emirati dissidents who demanded political reform.\n\nAbout 60 of the \"UAE 94\" put on trial then remain behind bars for alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that is outlawed in the Gulf state.\n\nIn a letter sent to UAE authorities in January, independent U.N. experts said they were concerned that the latest proceedings against the 84 defendants reflect \"a broader pattern of suppression of dissent and civil society in the UAE\".\n\nThey questioned \"alleged irregularities\" such as \"the use of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment to extract forced confessions\".\n\nBen Saul, the U.N.'s special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, said the latest charges \"relate to the same conduct for which many of these defendants were tried the first time around a decade ago\".\n\nThe trial was a \"deeply regressive step\" and a \"terrible example of the misuse of counter-terrorism measures against civil society\", he told an expert panel hosted by the Geneva Press Club in March.\n\nLast week, HRW said many of the defendants have been kept incommunicado for at least a year and have reported abuses including physical assault, lack of access to medicine, incessant loud music and forced nudity.\n\nThe wealthy country's allies, including the United States, Britain and the European Union, should speak out about the \"unfair mass trial\", HRW said.\n\n\"Emirati authorities have long used their country's economic and security relationships to prevent criticism of its rights record, but rarely, if ever, has the silence from its allies been so deafening,\" said HRW's Ms. Shea.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news",

UN experts have also expressed concerns over the rule of law in the UAE following the mass sentencing.\n\nHRW criticised the international community's \"silence\", saying such lack of action led to the life sentences handed to some of the UAE's most prominent voices.\n\nThe trial has been characterised by several violations, according to rights groups. HRW said that UAE authorities had restricted access to information and case material, shrouded the hearings in secrecy and violated the principle of double jeopardy, an rule that prohibits trying people twice for the same offence and after they have already received a final verdict.\n\nThe leading rights group also said that the defendants had spoken of the torture, physical and sexual abuse and abhorrent conditions they were subject to while awaiting trial. They have also been deprived of contact with their families, who in turn have been barred from entering the court room to observe trail sessions.\n\nIt is also calling for the UAE to \"immediately overturn\" the convictions and urged the defendants' release.\n\nThe dissidents' conviction comes as the UAE increasingly projects a progressive image of itself on the world stage, amid its allyship with several Western countries and a being a tourism and expat hubs for many of the world's rich and famous.\n\nAmnesty stressed that the case should be \"the final nail in the coffin\" of the country's attempts to \"disguise its horrendous human rights abuses behind a progressive facade\".", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [],

The mass trial, which included critics of the government and human rights activist, has faced heavy criticism from UN experts and rights groups.\n\nA total of 84 defendants appeared before the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal, many of whom have been imprisoned since a previous trial of 94 people in 2013.\n\nAccording to the official WAM news agency, the Abu Dhabi court convicted 43 individuals for \"creating, establishing, and managing a terrorist organisation\" tied to the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Ten additional defendants were sentenced to 10-15 years in prison, while one person was acquitted, and 24 cases were deemed inadmissible. The specifics of the remaining cases were not provided. Defendants still have the opportunity to appeal these verdicts before the Federal Supreme Court.\n\nHuman rights groups and United Nations experts condemned the trial, accusing the wealthy Gulf monarchy of repressing dissent. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International noted that many defendants have been in prison for over a decade since the \"UAE 94\" trial. However, UAE authorities argue that the new charges are distinct from those in 2013, emphasising that these involve accusations of financing a terrorist organisation.\n\nThough the UAE has not disclosed the identities of the 84 defendants, the UK-based Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center has identified more than 70, most of whom are already incarcerated.\n\nJoey Shea, HRW's UAE researcher, commented on the verdict.\n\n\"The latest verdict makes a 'mockery of justice'. It is 'another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society.'\"\n\nAmnesty International also criticised the trial.\n\n\"Trying 84 Emiratis at once, including 26 prisoners of conscience and well-known human rights defenders, is a scarcely disguised exercise in punishing dissenters,\" said Devin Kenney, Amnesty's UAE Researcher.\n\nThe UAE government has denied any wrongdoing. According to WAM, the court ensured that all defendants' rights were protected.\n\n\"The report said they were trying to 'create and replicate violent events' that would have left 'dead and injured in the squares and streets.'\"\n\nThe UAE, a federation of seven monarchies, has strict laws prohibiting criticism of its rulers and any speech seen as causing social unrest. Defamation, as well as verbal and written insults, whether public or private, are punishable offenses.\n\nIn 2012, following the Arab Spring uprisings, the UAE initiated arrests and prosecutions against numerous Emirati dissidents advocating for political reform. Roughly 60 individuals from the \"UAE 94\" trial remain incarcerated for alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn a January letter to UAE authorities, independent UN experts expressed concern over the latest proceedings, citing a potential pattern of suppressing dissent and civil society in the UAE. They highlighted potential irregularities, such as \"the use of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment to extract forced confessions.\"\n\nBen Saul, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, assessed the situation.\n\n\"The latest charges 'relate to the same conduct for which many of these defendants were tried the first time around a decade ago.' The trial was a 'deeply regressive step' and a 'terrible example of the misuse of counter-terrorism measures against civil society.'\"\n\nRecently, HRW reported that many of the defendants had been kept incommunicado for at least a year and experienced abuses, including physical assault, forced nudity, lack of access to medication, and incessant loud music.\n\nHRW urged the wealthy UAE's international allies, including the United States, Britain, and the European Union, to criticise the trial.\n\n\"Emirati authorities have long used their country's economic and security relationships to prevent criticism of its rights record, but rarely, if ever, has the silence from its allies been so deafening,\" said HRW's Shea.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

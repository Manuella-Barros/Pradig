spokesman at Jammu, said the firing, which began around 5.15 am, was unprovoked, and that the Indian army retaliated strongly.\n\n\"In the exchange of fire, Naib Subedar Jagram Singh Tomar was grievously injured and later succumbed to his wounds,\" he said.\n\nTomar, 42, was from Tarsana village in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh. He is survived by his wife, Omavati Devi, and two children. \"Tomar was a brave and sincere soldier.

Sepoy Pawan Singh Sugra of 20-Kumoan regiment was slain in unprovoked firing on Tuesday.\n\nInitially, Pakistani army used small arms and automatic weaponry, targeting the Sarla Post of the Indian army. Minutes later they resorted to heavy mortar shelling on civilian areas.\n\nOne of the shells landed near the house of Ruqiya Bi, 45, at Gohlad Kalran village, killing her on the spot.\n\n\"Ruqiya Bi was preparing for morning namaz when a shell landed outside her house. She was a mother of four. Our Sub Divisional Magistrate and Tehsildar visited her house soon after,\" said Tariq Ahmad Zargar, deputy commissioner in Poonch district.\n\nLast Monday, a soldier was injured in crossborder firing in Uri sector of North Kashmir's Baramulla district.\n\nMeanwhile, life came to grinding halt in Kashmir valley and some Muslim-dominated areas of Jammu after people observed shutdown against any move to abrogate Article 35 A, which allows the state legislature to define the list of 'permanent residents' and their special rights and privileges.\n\nPakistani army committed 285 ceasefire violations till August 1 this year, according to official figures\n\nAround 228 of these incidents were reported along the LoC in 2016 and 221 from the international border\n\nIn 2015, around 405 incidents of cross-border firing took place along the border in J&K.

and a woman were killed while four others were injured in an ongoing encounter between security forces and militants in south Kashmir's Shopian district on Saturday evening.\n\nInspector General of Police, Kashmir Munir Khan said that a soldier was killed in the ongoing gunfight in Awneera village of Shopian, 56 km from here. \"We have lost one soldier. Four others have been injured,\" he told reporters.\n\nSources said three militants are believed to be holed up inside the village which has been cordoned off by Army's 3-Rashtriya Rifles (RR) battalion, 14 battalion of CRPF and special operations group (SOG) of police. \"The exchange of gunfire was going on between holed-up militants and security forces till late in the night,\" they said.\n\nReports said as soon the news of encounter spread, stone pelting mobs clashed with security forces near the encounter site with people trying to disrupt the anti-terror operation. Several civilians were injured in the clashes, they said.\n\nMeanwhile, a civilian was injured in an explosion in Srinagar's Dalgate area on Saturday evening. Reports said the explosion occurred on a roadside in the area. A police official said that they are investigating the nature of blast.\n\nCiting officials, PTI also reported that earlier in the day, a 40-year-old woman was killed in Gohlad Kalran village after the Pakistani army resorted to indiscriminate firing for nearly one-and-a-half-hour.\n\nA defence spokesman said the Pakistan army initiated the unprovoked firing on the Indian Army posts at around 5 PM today.\n\n\"The Indian Army retaliated strongly and effectively,\" he said.\n\nIn the exchange of fire, Naib Subedar Jagram Singh Tomar (42), resident of Madhya Pradesh, was grievously injured and later succumbed to injuries, the spokesman said.\n\nTomar, who hailed from Tarsana village in Morena district in MP, is survived by his wife Omavati Devi, a son and a daughter, he said.\n\n\"He was a brave and sincere soldier. The nation will always remain indebted to him for the supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty,\" he added.\n\nHis death took the number of jawans killed in the sector in the last five days to two. On August 8, Sepoy Pawan Singh Sugra (21) was killed in unprovoked Pakistani firing.\n\nEarlier in the day, a 40-year-old woman was killed in Gohlad Kalran village after the Pakistani army resorted to indiscriminate firing for nearly one-and-a-half-hour.\n\n\"The Pakistani army initiated unprovoked and indiscriminate firing of small arms, automatic weapons and mortars from 0515 hours in Poonch sector along the LoC. The Indian Army personnel guarding the border posts retaliated strongly and effectively. The exchange of fire stopped at 0645 hours,\" the spokesman said.\n\nA police officer, while giving details about the incident, said at around 5.20 AM, mortar shells fired from across the border exploded near the house of one Mohammad Shabir in the village, killing his wife Raqia Bi.\n\nOn August 3, two soldiers, including an Army Major, were killed when militants opened fire on a search party of security forces in the same district. 132 militants, including top commanders like Abu Dujana, Sabzar Bhat, Bashir Lashkari and Junaid Mattoo, have been killed so far this year in the Valley, which is highest in the last eight years. The security forces are going after militants as part of operation \"hunt down\" and on the basis of a \"hit list\" of militants.\n\nTill August 1 this year, there have been 285 instances of ceasefire violation by the Pakistani troops. In 2016, the number was significantly less at 228.", "time": "18:02:00"}

As usual, the Indian side retaliated very effectively decimating three Pakistani posts and bunkers, which were engaged in targeting civilian population in the area.\n\nOfficial sources told the Excelsior that Pakistan army initiated unprovoked firing in Indian Army posts in Mankote area of Krishna Ghati sector of Poonch district at 5 pm today. The Indian side retaliated strongly and effectively.\n\nClick here to watch video\n\nIn the exchange of firing, Naib Subedar Jagram Singh Tomar and Sepoy Mohit Kumar were injured. Tomar later succumbed to grievous injuries sustained by him in the firing.\n\nTomar, aged 42 years, belonged to village Tarsana in Porsa area of Morena district of Madhya Pradesh and is survived by his wife Omawati Devi, one son and one daughter.\n\n\"Naib Subedar Jagram Singh Tomar, was a brave and sincere soldier. The nation will always remain indebted to him for the supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty,'' a Defence spokesman said.\n\nInjured Army jawan Sepoy Mohit Kumar has been hospitalized.\n\nThe firing lasted about 40 minutes and stopped from Pakistan side after heavy retaliatory firing brought down by the Indian troops, sources said.\n\nMeanwhile, mortar shelling by Pakistan in Mendhar sector early today, though for a brief period, was very intense with mortar shells raining just 200 meters from Mendhar town, causing panic among the civilians living in the border villages as shells were falling very close to their houses.\n\nHowever, the shelling that started at 5.15 am ended at 6.25 am after three posts and bunkers of Pakistan army, which were engaged in firing mortars in the civilian areas of Mendhar, were razed to ground, sources told the Excelsior.\n\nOne of the mortar shells fell in the premises of Master Mohammad Shabir at Gohlad in Mendhar sector around 5.30 am and exploded with a bang, killing his 40-year old wife Raqia Bi on the spot. She was hit by splinters of the mortar shell on her head leading to her instant death. Their house was also damaged.\n\nSources said the woman was preparing to leave house for the local Mosque for morning prayers when the shelling suddenly started and one of the mortar shells fell inside the house, killing here.\n\nSeveral other mortar shells also fell in the villages at Gohlad and Sabra Gali but the people remained confined to their houses and had very narrow escape in the shelling and firing.\n\nThe Indian side hit back very strongly and destroyed three Pakistani posts and bunkers, which were raining mortars and bullets on the Indian positions in Mendhar sector. There were reports that Pakistan army suffered casualties in retaliatory action by the Indian Army but exact figures were not available.\n\nPointing out that some militants were also camping across LoC waiting for infiltration into the Indian territory, sources said Pakistan army was also trying to facilitate the intrusion bids but was finding it impossible to push the militants due to high alert being maintained by the Indian troops on the LoC.\n\nPanic gripped the people living in forward areas of Mendhar as soon as mortar shelling started early this morning. The people confined themselves to houses and bunkers and didn't come out even more than two hours after mortar shelling had stopped. Some of the houses suffered damage in the shelling, sources said.\n\nLocal people in Gohlad held protest demonstration this morning against shelling by Pakistan army and failure of the administration to reach the spot for timely help to the victims. However, civil and police officers later reached the spot and gave Rs 5000 to the victim family from Red Cross Fund and promises ex-gratia payment under rules shortly. Senior officers of Army, police and civil administration joined burial of the woman at Gohlad.\n\nOn August 8, the Pakistani troops had resorted to firing and shelling in Krishna Ghati sector of Poonch district, killing Sepoy Pawan Singh Sugra (21).\n\nTill August 1 this year, there have been 285 instances of ceasefire violation by the Pakistani forces.

ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir by opening fire at Indian posts, resulting in injuries to three soldiers, officials said.\n\nThe Pakistani troops opened fire at Indian positions at Baaz Post in Uri in Baramulla district at around 8:30pm, defence spokesperson said.\n\nThe Indian troops returned the fire strongly and effectively, he added.\n\nHe said three soldiers suffered bullet injuries in the firing and were admitted to the 92 Base Hospital of the Army in Srinagar.\n\nThis was the fourth ceasefire violation by Pakistan in the past 48 hours.\n\nEarlier in the day, Pakistani troops violated the ceasefire thrice in Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nOn Saturday, an Army soldier was martyred while another was critically injured as Pakistan resorted to ceasefire violation in Krishna Ghati sector of Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nIn another incident, yesterday, a civilian was killed during unprovoked shelling in state's Mendhar sector.\n\nThe two armies have repeatedly exchanged heavy fire this summer along the winding LoC that has left many soldiers and civilians dead on both sides.\n\nIndia had summoned Pakistan High Commission official Tariq Karim on August 9 and issued a demarche \"lodging strong protest\" over the death of an Indian soldier in unprovoked ceasefire violation by Pakistan in Krishna Ghati sector the previous day, terming it as \"deplorable\".\n\nDespite repeated calls for restraint and call to adhere to the ceasefire understanding of 2003 for maintaining peace and tranquillity, Pakistan forces have carried out 301 incidents of unprovoked ceasefire violations along the LoC this year, the Ministry of External Affairs said.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc

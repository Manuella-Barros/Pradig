She also is a law professor at Georgetown University.\n\nHer previous nominations to the nation's financial regulators were unanimously confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"She has proven herself to be a strong, independent, and fair regulator who is not afraid to do what's right,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and chair of the Senate Banking Committee, in a statement.\n\nGruenberg last month said he would resign from the FDIC, after an independent report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton found incidents of stalking, harassment, homophobia and other violations of employment regulations, based on more than 500 complaints from employees.\n\nComplaints included a woman who said she was stalked by a coworker and continually harassed even after complaining about his behavior; a field office supervisor referring to gay men as \"little girls;\" and a female field examiner who described receiving a picture of an FDIC senior examiner's private parts.\n\nRepublicans have been calling for Gruenberg to step down since the allegations emerged late last year. The White House and Gruenberg resisted those calls partly because the FDIC is led by a five member board, and his resignation would pass control of the agency to the FDIC's vice chair, who is a Republican. Gruenberg's resignation would not be official until Goldsmith Romero nomination is finalized.\n\n\"FDIC employees deserve a safe workplace that allows them to focus on their important mission to safeguard our country's financial security.

Gruenberg announced in May he planned to resign in the wake of a scathing external report that detailed workplace misconduct at the agency and questioned his ability to bring about reform.\n\nGruenberg said he would only step down once a successor is confirmed by the Senate. That decision prevents a vacancy that would elevate the Republican vice chair of the FDIC, Travis Hill, and imperil the Biden administration's financial regulatory agenda that includes a crackdown on big Wall Street banks.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, who called for Gruenberg's ouster, has vowed to work quickly to push through a replacement nominee. But Democrats face a tight timeline to advance Goldsmith Romero's nomination given the dwindling number of weeks the Senate is scheduled to remain in session before its monthlong August recess.\n\nGoldsmith Romero was confirmed as a Democratic commissioner on the CFTC, which regulates financial derivatives, in 2022 on a voice vote in the Senate.\n\nBut this nomination fight is likely to be considerably more contentious. The FDIC chair has a key vote in finalizing a major proposal by regulators to hike capital requirements on large banks, which the industry is furiously fighting. Republicans and even some Democrats have joined with big banks in blasting the proposal, known as the Basel III Endgame.\n\nAt the CFTC, Goldsmith Romero has regularly called for a more aggressive strategy in overseeing Wall Street, a stance that has sometimes led to clashes with Chair Rostin Behnam. She has pressed for more guilty admissions in enforcement settlements, a rethinking of the CFTC's approach to individual investors and warned of the dangers that lie in crypto markets.\n\nBefore joining the CFTC, Goldsmith Romero was the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the massive bailout Congress passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. She was nominated for that role by President Barack Obama in 2012 and continued in the job during the Trump administration and the beginning of the Biden administration.\n\nShe previously served in various staff posts at the Securities and Exchange Commission, including as a top enforcement attorney and as counsel to Chair Christopher Cox and Chair Mary Schapiro.\n\nGoldsmith Romero was also among the possible recent candidates for a top Treasury Department role focused on banking and insurance following the departure Graham Steele, who was assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions and left the administration in January.\n\nIf confirmed, she will be tasked with cleaning up the FDIC, which for months has been engulfed in controversy over allegations of a toxic workplace culture. She would be the sole woman on the five-member FDIC board.\n\nIn April, an outside investigation by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton concluded that the FDIC needs \"cultural and structural change.\" The firm's report documented widespread sexual harassment, discrimination, bullying and other misconduct for years that management did little to stop.\n\nThe report questioned whether Gruenberg was the right person to lead change at the agency, citing incidents of him \"losing his temper and interacting with staff in a demeaning and inappropriate manner.\"\n\nGruenberg apologized and said he accepted the findings of the report. Still, he initially seemed poised to hang onto his job after two bruising days of testimony on Capitol Hill in May. Key Democrats -- including Brown, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters -- appeared to stand by him even as they expressed concern about the workplace issues at the FDIC.\n\nBut that changed several days later when Brown, who is facing a close reelection battle in Ohio this year, called for new leadership at the agency. The White House immediately said it would put forward a new nominee for the role.\n\nRepublicans plan to continue to ratchet up the pressure on Gruenberg to resign immediately and not wait until a successor is confirmed.\n\nThe agency's inspector general is also conducting two inquiries into the allegations of workplace misconduct at the agency, both of which are due out in the coming months.\n\nThe inspector general last month publicly blasted the FDIC for failing to properly report allegations involving the agency's senior leaders, though it did not specify which leaders or the nature of those allegations.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. -- continued to decry Gruenberg's continued presence atop the agency, where he has served on the Board of Directors for nearly 20 years and as chair for nearly 10, both in acting and Senate-confirmed capacities. when the White House nominates and the Senate confirms a replacement. In opening remarks, McHenry called Gruenberg's conditioning of his resignation on the presence of a replacement as insufficiently urgent, considering the severity of the allegations brought against the agency.\n\n\"Resigning after the confirmation of a new chair is just more of the status quo,\" McHenry said. \"Chair Gruenberg knows this, which is why he told employees at the FDIC to continue as if he would be there until the end of the year. That is outrageous.\"\n\nMany Democrats also argued their colleagues across the aisle lacked moral authority to demand new leadership. Representative Maxine Waters, D-Calif. -- the ranking member on the committee -- said the misconduct detailed in the report occurred across many administrations and was unresolved.\n\n\"Republicans are attacking the Democratic chair, who has already announced he will step down,\" she noted. \"But you won't hear them call for Republican [FDIC] Vice Chair, Travis Hill, to step down despite him being a senior official under former chair McWilliams when allegations of misconduct persisted.\"\n\nThe FDIC workplace scandal detailing numerous instances of sexual harassment and racial prejudice at the agency spanning decades. The FDIC Michael Hsu and Jonathan McKernan to lead the investigation. Law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton was last month, largely corroborating the findings of the Wall Street Journal investigation.\n\nWhile Gruenberg was not accused of sexual misconduct or harassment, the report detailed instances where Gruenberg yelled at and berated subordinates but did not explicitly call for his ouster. Despite the report's findings, Gruenberg retained his position and participated in . However, for the Chairman as at the FDIC, leading Gruenberg to announce his intention to step down.\n\nThe hearing, which featured testimony from McKernan and Hsu, as well as representatives of Cleary Gottlieb who undertook the investigation. While , McHenry left the door open for future hearings, saying he looks forward to his appearance before the committee in the future. FDIC has said they were in contact with the committee in search of a future date.\n\nDemocrats pushed back on the accusations that they are stalling Gruenberg's replacement, pointing to the fact that the Whitehouse has been moving relatively fast in an election year to choose a replacement. Reports over the weekend prior reported the Administration is on the precipice of nominating to the post.\n\nWaters also argued that the GOP lacked moral authority given that presumptive Republican nominee for president Donald Trump has been found liable for sexual assault and weathered persistent accusations of sexual harassment over the course of his career.\n\n\"We hear much complaining about it here with respect to a democratic appointee Mr. Gruenberg who's admitted that he's leaving, but yet all my Republican colleagues are supporting former President Trump, who has got an atrocious and long record of poor treatment [of women],\" said Rep. Stephen F. Lynch, D-Mass. \"The relevance here is that the next president will appoint the FDIC chair that we're questioning the conduct of today.\"\n\nThe FDIC board members on the panel also fielded a number of questions about how the fallout from the report had been affecting staff morale. McKernan expressed hope that accountability will soon come for those found to have engaged in misconduct.\n\nWhen asked what he meant by real accountability, McKernan indicated he wanted to see a change in leadership.\n\n\"We need a fresh start sooner rather than later, that's important to establish credibility,\" he said. \"It's important to bring in someone that has the moral authority to really push change and ... deal with our legacy issues.\"\n\nRep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., asked Mckernan about his outlook for accountability. McKernan answered skeptically, and suggested that the board take a more \"active role\" in FDIC governance until Gruenberg leaves office.\n\n\"I'm not particularly optimistic we'll see accountability soon,\" he said. \"I think there's a real question here that we at the board need to consider during this interim, when we're waiting for a new chair, we're waiting for the current chair to resign and have the acting chair, I think the board needs to take a more active role here.\"\n\nLutkemeyer pressed McKernan, a Republican, to do more or risk being seen as complacent.\n\n\"As leaders, you need to step up and stop the nonsense, otherwise you're an enabler,\" he said. \"You continue to allow this to go on, you're no better than Gruenberg in my mind...this has got to be stopped.\"\n\nRep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., asked Mckernan about how agency staff are faring in light of the scandal. McKernan said that the turmoil has presented a significant headwind to the agency, that workers are generally exhausted and distracted.\n\n\"The morale at the FDIC is bad [and] that's not good for our ability to execute on the mission,\" he said. \"The state of affairs at the FDIC -- if not fixed -- are going to be a real problem for retention and recruitment of new staff, and that will be fatal to our ability to achieve our mission.\"\n\nLawmakers voiced bipartisan agreement on the need to move any prospective nominee out of the White House. Democrat Bill Foster, D-Ill. -- the lone Democrat who had called for Gruenberg's resignation upon publication of the Cleary Gottlieb report -- said the Senate should confirm a replacement without delay, but made clear a very real roadblock to replacing Gruenberg will be Senate Republicans' to previous Biden Administration bank regulatory nominees.\n\n\"I encourage the Biden administration to quickly nominate a new chair -- which I understand is underway,\" he said. \"And I look forward to my Republican colleagues, encouraging their Senate colleagues to rapidly confirm the replacement for Mr. Gruenberg,\"\n\nWaters struck a similar tone, saying that if Republicans are serious about their outrage over Gruenberg's presence at the FDIC, they will confirm his replacement quickly.\n\n\"If Republicans are committed to change in the work culture at the FDIC,\" she said. \"I expect that they will join with Democrats to support her swift Senate confirmation.\"\n\nWhether that confirmation will be swift is open to debate. Todd Baker -- managing principal at Broadmoor Consulting and a senior fellow at Columbia University -- said he continues to believe that a pre-election confirmation is unlikely.\n\n\"The nomination of a woman to replace Gruenberg takes the Democrats off the hook and I can't see the Senate Republicans viewing confirmation as a priority, as they presumably think they will take the White House in November and appoint their own candidate,\" wrote Baker in an email. \"If they don't win the Presidency, they still may take the Senate, in which case they will be in a much better position to influence any Democratic nominee.\"\n\nIsaac Boltansky, a research analyst at BTIG, said he doesn't see major changes after today's hearing, continuing to believe while remotely possible, a swift confirmation is highly improbable. Gruenberg's replacement, he says, will be slow-walked until it is eclipsed in political importance by the election.\n\n\"My sense is that the nomination will be slow-walked in the hopes that this issue fades into the background of an election year summer,\" said Boltansky. \"That would allow Gruenberg to stay in place and continue moving forward Democratic policy priorities for the next few months.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanbanker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Banker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_J._Gruenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin J.

Goldsmith Romero, a Democratic commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will replace Martin Gruenberg who is stepping down after a damning probe found widespread sexual harassment and other misconduct at the top banking regulator.\n\nThe White House is rushing to fill the role so it can push through U.S. President Joe Biden's regulatory agenda, including major bank capital hikes, just six months ahead of the U.S. presidential election. While administration officials have said they want to move fast, the White House and Democratic Senate Banking Committee chair Sherrod Brown, who is responsible for advancing FDIC nominees, have not said when they expect to hold hearings.\n\nKristin Johnson, the CFTC's other Democratic commissioner who was also in the running for the FDIC chair role, will be nominated for Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department at the same time, the same source said. The White House declined comment. Spokespeople for Brown, Treasury and the FDIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment out of business hours. A spokesperson for the CFTC declined to comment.\n\nThe hearing for Johnson will take place alongside Goldsmith Romero's, the source said. She had been lined up for the Treasury role before Gruenberg succumbed last month to political pressure to resign. Also a Democrat, Gruenberg is staying on until the Senate has confirmed the new chair, which would allow Democrats to retain control of the agency until at least January next year.\n\nWith the election looming, though, time is tight. The Senate is in session just half of July and out August through Labor Day on September 2. That leaves two months before the November general election when Senators who are up for re-election prefer to be campaigning at home rather than tied up in Washington. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that a formal announcement could come this week. Punchbowl News earlier on Wednesday reported that the White House would announce Romero's nomination on Thursday.

The FDIC chief succumbed to pressure from lawmakers who said the bank regulator needed fresh leadership after an investigation found widespread sexual harassment and other misconduct at the agency.\n\nGoldsmith Romero, 53, has a background in enforcement and has led major actions against Wall Street banks and other financial firms during her career. She joined the CFTC in March 2022 after a decade investigating financial crime and fraud as the watchdog of a key 2009 financial crisis bailout program.\n\nThe White House also said it plans to nominate Kristin Johnson, also a Democratic CFTC Commissioner, to be the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial institutions, a key role after three banks failed in 2023. Reuters reported on Wednesday their nominations were imminent, as the Biden administration pushes for first nomination hearings the week of July 8.\n\nDuring Goldsmith Romero's tenure as Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) from 2012 to 2022, her office brought cases and cooperated in federal enforcement actions against major corporations, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and General Motors.\n\nGoldsmith Romero also received awards from the U.S. Attorney General and Department of Justice's Criminal Division after her office uncovered a multibillion-dollar fraud, leading to jail terms for former executives at the former mortgage lender Taylor, Bean & Whitaker and the failed Colonial Bank.\n\nIn progressive circles, she is seen as a strong fit for the FDIC role and as having the management experience and skill set necessary to help fix the agency's \"toxic\" environment, as the investigation described the FDIC, and address other challenges.\n\nThe FDIC is also grappling with the fallout of last year's bank failures, which exposed supervisory weaknesses at the regulator, and is trying to finalize a handful of contentious new rules for Wall Street banks, including major capital hikes.\n\nGoldsmith Romero's nomination, a process that usually takes months, comes at a precarious time politically, just five months ahead of the November general election.\n\nA number of Senate Democrats are up for re-election in narrow races, including Sherrod Brown who chairs the Banking Committee that must advance the FDIC nominee, making a potentially contentious confirmation process difficult to navigate. Democrats narrowly control the Senate.\n\n\"Getting a nominee through the Senate in the summer of a presidential election year is always an uphill battle, but the toxic politics and compressed timing make this forthcoming nomination a sprint up Mount Everest,\" said Tyler Gellasch, CEO of Healthy Markets Association in Washington, a non profit focused on financial markets.\n\nGUILTY ADMISSIONS\n\nAs a CFTC commissioner, Goldsmith Romero has advocated for stronger policing of U.S. markets and stiffer penalties for misconduct.\n\nMost notably, she has pushed for the agency to secure more admissions of wrongdoing from companies when settling enforcement actions, particularly from repeat offenders.\n\n\"We've seen Wall Street banks get one enforcement action after another ... so I'm looking for a greater deterrent impact,\" she told Reuters in a 2022 interview.\n\nThat campaign was evidenced by a recent CFTC settlement with JPMorgan Chase, in which the bank admitted it broke the agency's rules.\n\nShe has also led the agency's efforts to better understand the potential impact of artificial intelligence on financial markets.\n\nPrior to being appointed SIGTARP, Goldsmith Romero was counsel to then U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairs Mary Schapiro and Christopher Cox and had investigated securities law violations.\n\nShe started her career as a law clerk at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Nevada after graduating from Brigham Young University Law School in 1995.\n\nThe White House also said Biden intends to nominate Caroline Crenshaw to another term as commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Gordon Ito to be a member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\n\n(Additional reporting by Pete Schroeder; editing by Michelle Price and Rod Nickel)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_J._Gruenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin J.

Top Republicans didn't immediately decry her nomination.\n\n\"I will review Christy Goldsmith Romero's nomination to ensure she has the qualities necessary to support employees, lead the FDIC through the changes it desperately needs, and return credibility to the independent agency,\" said Senate Banking Committee ranking member Tim Scott, R-S.C., in a statement.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said he hopes to hold a hearing on the nomination, alongside others announced by the Biden administration under the banking committee's jurisdiction, \"in the coming weeks.\"\n\n\"I call on the entire Banking and Housing Committee, Senate leadership, and the full Senate to move quickly to bring new leadership to the FDIC at this challenging time,\" he said.\n\nGoldsmith Romero is currently a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and previously served as the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program at the Treasury Department.\n\nIn that role, Goldsmith Romero sussed out fraud and other misconduct by banks that received money from that program. Her office brought cases and helped in federal enforcement actions against several banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\n\nGoldsmith Romero would be tasked with cleaning up the beleaguered regulator, which has come under fire after a series of stories from The Wall Street Journal detailed serious workplace misconduct issues at the agency. Gruenberg's fitness to continue as chairman was called into question after a report from Cleary Gottlieb said that his temper could make it difficult for him to lead the agency through necessary reforms.\n\nGoldsmith Romero's nomination comes with a key advantage for the White House: She's already been confirmed by the Senate twice, the last time for the CFTC in 2022. She has, but has in the past worked for Republican commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and didn't receive too much consternation from Republicans in the past.\n\nGiven that her last confirmation was so recent, it's possible that her paperwork filed with the Senate is still valid, and that she could move quickly through the confirmation process.\n\nThe White House and Senate Democratic leadership are likely to want to move fast on the nomination. The Senate is up against a tight deadline with few legislative days left before the 2024 presidential election in November.\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee will have to hold a hearing, and should Goldsmith Romero's nomination pass that committee, it will need to be considered by the full Senate.\n\nBrown previously called for the White House to nominate a new head of the FDIC after a pair of brutal hearings for Gruenberg in front of the Senate and House.\n\nAfter Brown's statement urging the White House to nominate a new FDIC chair, Gruenberg said he would resign once the Senate confirmed a new leader for the agency.\n\nGoldsmith Romero's confirmation would allow the agency to continue operating with Democratic leadership. If Gruenberg were to resign before Democrats had lined up a new chair, the FDIC's Republican vice chairman, Travis Hill, would head the agency and leave the board deadlocked.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the pervasive culture of misbehavior and abuse outlined in a Cleary Gottlieb report. Although House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., demanded Gruenberg's attendance, did not testify.\n\nThe Conference of State Supervisors said in a statement immediately after her nomination that Goldsmith Romero has no state supervisory experience. The group has pushed the issue of an FDIC board member needing that experience, a requirement that has historically been ignored.\n\n\"By nominating an individual to the FDIC Board who lacks state bank supervisory experience, the White House, once again, has ignored the requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\" the group said.\n\nThe CSBS said that the Senate should \"fully explore her positions on critical matters affecting the dual-banking system and the importance of preserving the role of the states in our financial system.\"\n\nTop Republicans continued to call for Gruenberg's immediate resignation, rather than waiting for Goldsmith Romero's confirmation.\n\n\"Another day with Martin Gruenberg at the helm of the FDIC is one too many,\" said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. \"Chair Gruenberg's successor must be prepared to hit the ground running to implement the Cleary Gottlieb recommendations and end the egregious misconduct that has come to define the agency during his tenure.\n\nMcHenry said that the Senate \"must move forward with the confirmation proceedings expeditiously.\"\n\nThe administration also announced the nomination of another CFTC official -- commissioner Kristin Johnson -- to the role of assistant secretary for financial institutions at Treasury. Johnson has served as commissioner at the CFTC since March 2022.\n\nThe post was most recently held by Graham Steele, who was nominated in July 2021 and resigned from the position in January 2024.\n\nJohnson's potential nomination of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, and the Congressional Black Caucus. Waters emphasized Johnson's expertise in financial regulation and her perspective as a woman of color, advocating for her nomination in a letter to Biden.\n\nJohnson previously served as a law professor at Emory and Tulane universities. Johnson worked as an assistant general counsel at JPMorgan Chase. At the CFTC, she has worked on policies including , digital asset risk management, and . She also leads the agency's Market Risk Advisory Committee, focusing on AI and carbon credit derivative markets.", "source": {"uri": "americanbanker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Banker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_Goldsmith_Romero", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christy Goldsmith Romero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_J._Gruenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin J.

That's important to establish credibility. It's important to bring in someone that has a moral authority to really push change. And it's important that we have clean hands to deal with our legacy issues,\" McKernan said.\n\nLawmakers, however, are casting doubts on FDIC's ability to implement workplace reforms with FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg remaining on the job.\n\nGruenberg said last month he'll stay at FDIC until the Senate confirms his successor. But Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) is calling on President Joe Biden to fire him immediately, and allow an acting chairperson to take over.\n\n\"There's a clear succession plan in place. The agency's operations would continue unabated if you rightfully stepped down today,\" McHenry said.\n\nGruenberg has held leadership positions at FDIC for nearly 20 years.\n\nAn independent report into FDIC's workplace culture said Gruenberg's longstanding tenure at the agency \"may hinder his ability to establish trust and confidence in leading meaningful culture change.\"\n\n\"For these challenges to be overcome, there must at least be a genuine and sustained commitment to lead a culture change, accompanied by a recognition and acknowledgement that such change is necessary because of failings of the past, including his own,\" the report states.\n\nFDIC created a special committee to oversee an independent review of FDIC's workplace culture, following several reports in the Wall Street Journal in November 2023.\n\nLast month, FDIC publicly released a report led by the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.\n\nThe report includes cases of stalking, harassment, homophobia and other violations of employment regulations, based on more than 500 complaints from employees.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, an FDIC employee told investigators she was stalked by a coworker and faced harassment, even after complaining about his behavior.\n\nThe report also mentions a supervisor in a field office referring to gay men as \"little girls,\" and a female field examiner who said she received pictures of a senior examiner's private parts.\n\nMichael Hsu, co-chair of FDIC's special committee, said the report found Gruenberg was \"not cited as a root cause\" of the FDIC's problems.\n\nJoon Kim, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, said women and minorities working at FDIC were more often the targets of misconduct in a workplace that he described as \"patriarchal or insular.\"\n\nMcKernan said the report demonstrated biases \"in favor of the male workforce.\"\n\nThe White House says Gruenberg will step down once a successor is appointed and that President Joe Biden will name a replacement soon.\n\nBiden has yet to submit a new nominee to lead FDIC, but several lawmakers said Wednesday that Biden intends to nominate Christy Goldsmith Romero, commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to serve as FDIC chairwoman.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday that she had no update on Biden's nominee.\n\n\"We understand how important it is to have an FDIC chair in place. So we're going to certainly stay laser-focused on getting that done,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nWith an unclear timeline of when FDIC would get a new permanent leader,\n\nMcKernan told lawmakers he's \"not particularly optimistic we'll see accountability soon.\"\n\n\"I think there's a real question here, that we at the board need to consider, during this interim when we're waiting for a new chair or we're waiting for the current chair to resign, and have the acting chair. I think the board needs to take a more active role here and I have been pushing for that,\" he said.\n\nFDIC currently ranks 25 out of 26 midsize agencies on the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government scorecard tracked by the Partnership for Public Service.\n\n\"Morale is bad,\" McKernan said. \"We were near the top for quite some time. I think it's fair to say that staff have seen no real accountability, so it's hard to see much commitment to change, absent that accountability. I think it's fair to say that there's a lot of skepticism, even cynicism about prospects at the FDIC.\"\n\nMcKernan described flagging morale within FDIC's workforce, and that the agency faces recruitment and retention challenges.\n\n\"I think also going forward longer term, the state of affairs at the FDIC, if not fixed are going to be a real problem for retention and recruitment of new staff and that will be fatal to our ability to achieve our mission if we can't fix that,\" he said.\n\nFDIC is dealing with these persistent workforce issues amid a growing workload. The agency reported last month that 63 banks are on the brink of insolvency.\n\n\"Distraction certainly does not help,\" McKernan said.\n\nKim said a hotline that third-party investigators received over 500 calls from individuals, \"emotionally recounting experiences of sexual harassment, discrimination, and other interpersonal misconduct that they had suffered at the FCIC.\"\n\n\"Those who reported incidents to us expressed fear, sadness and anger at what they had to endure. Many had never reported their experiences to anyone before,\" Kim said. \"While others had reported internally, had been left disappointed by the FDIC's response, virtually all of them expressed hope that reporting what they had gone through to us might help change and make better the agency that they cared about deeply.\"\n\nKim told lawmakers that FDIC's workplace culture issues were longstanding and \"have spanned for many years across different chairs.\"\n\nAbena Mainoo, a partner at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, said that FDIC received 92 harassment complaints between 2015 and 2023, but that those complaints only led to suspensions in two cases.\n\n\"We found that far too many employees, and for too long, the FDIC has failed to provide a workplace safe from sexual harassment, discrimination and other interpersonal misconduct,\" Mainoo said. \"We also found that a patriarchal, hierarchic and insular culture helped create the conditions that allowed such misconduct to occur and persist.\"\n\nAmong FDIC's plans for reform, Hsu said the agency is addressing employees' fear of retaliation, implementing structural changes, and ensuring the board and senior management are held accountable \"for doing what's necessary to make the FDIC a safe and inclusive workplace.\"\n\n\"The employees of the FDIC need and deserve a safe and inclusive workplace and they need it now,\" Hsu said.\n\nHsu said the FDIC is in the process of replacing a \"broken\" internal processing for responding to reports of harassment. The new structure will bypass management hierarchies and instead redirect complaints to third-party investigators.\n\nHsu said FDIC is also hiring an independent \"transformation monitor\" to hold the agency accountable for following through on its plans to reform the agency.\n\nAn inspector general survey of FDIC employees in 2019 found that 8% of respondents said they experienced sexual harassment at the agency between January 2015 and April 2018.\n\nHowever, FDIC's Corporate Human Resources Information System (CHRIS) documented only two cases of sexual harassment and only seven cases of sexual harassment between 2008 and 2021.\n\nMainoo said the investigation found \"no reason to believe the CHRIS database was complete.\"\n\nSince the report's release, FDIC's human resources office has launched a system that tracks different types of interpersonal misconduct.\n\n\"It allows the FDIC to identify sexual harassment, for example, compared to a hostile work environment, and also identifies whether misconduct falls under FDIC's anti-harassment program, which the records before did not do,\" Mainoo said.", "source": {"uri": "federalnewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Federal News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_J._Gruenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin J.

She joined the CFTC in March 2022 after a decade investigating financial crime and fraud as the watchdog of a key 2009 financial crisis bailout program.\n\nDuring her tenure as Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) from 2012 to 2022, Goldsmith Romero's office brought cases and cooperated in federal enforcement actions against major corporations, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and General Motors.\n\nGoldsmith Romero also received awards from the U.S. Attorney General and Department of Justice's Criminal Division after her office uncovered a multibillion-dollar fraud, leading to jail terms for former executives at the former mortgage lender Taylor, Bean & Whitaker and the failed Colonial Bank.\n\nIn progressive circles, she is seen as a strong fit for the FDIC role and as having the management experience and skill set necessary to help fix the agency's \"toxic\" environment, as the investigation described the FDIC, and address other challenges.\n\nThe FDIC is also grappling with the fallout of last year's bank failures, which exposed supervisory weaknesses at the regulator, and is trying to finalize a handful of contentious new rules for Wall Street banks, including major capital hikes.\n\nGoldsmith Romero's nomination, a process that usually takes months, comes at a precarious time politically, just five months ahead of the November general election.\n\nA number of Senate Democrats are up for re-election in narrow races, including Sherrod Brown who chairs the Banking Committee that must advance the FDIC nominee, making a potentially contentious confirmation process difficult to navigate. Democrats control the Senate by a single vote.\n\n\"Getting a nominee through the Senate in the summer of a presidential election year is always an uphill battle, but the toxic politics and compressed timing make this forthcoming nomination a sprint up Mount Everest,\" said Tyler Gellasch, CEO of Healthy Markets Association in Washington, a non profit focused on financial markets.\n\nGUILTY ADMISSIONS\n\nAs a CFTC commissioner, Goldsmith Romero has advocated for stronger policing of U.S. markets and stiffer penalties for misconduct.\n\nMost notably, she has pushed for the agency to secure more admissions of wrongdoing from companies when settling enforcement actions, particularly from repeat offenders.\n\n\"We've seen Wall Street banks get one enforcement action after another ... so I'm looking for a greater deterrent impact,\" she told Reuters in a 2022 interview.\n\nThat campaign was evidenced by a recent CFTC settlement with JPMorgan Chase, in which the bank admitted it broke the agency's rules.\n\nShe has also led the agency's efforts to better understand the potential impact of artificial intelligence on financial markets.\n\nPrior to being appointed SIGTARP, Goldsmith Romero was counsel to then U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairs Mary Schapiro and Christopher Cox and had investigated securities law violations.\n\nShe started her career as a law clerk at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Nevada after graduating from Brigham Young University Law School in 1995.\n\n(Additional reporting by Pete Schroeder; editing by Michelle Price and Rod Nickel)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_J._Gruenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin J.

She would also play a key role in finalizing US rules that would force Wall Street banks to hold significantly more capital.\n\nThe FDIC has been at the center of a political firestorm since the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton released a report in May that detailed a toxic workplace at the regulator. Martin Gruenberg, the current chair, buckled to political pressure last month and said he would step down once his successor is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe Biden administration also announced Thursday that it plans to nominate Kristin Johnson, another Democratic commissioner at the CFTC, for a top role at the US Treasury Department overseeing banks.\n\nIf Johnson left her current job without a replacement, Republicans could have a majority -- at least temporarily -- at the regulator, which oversees swaps and futures trading.

She joined the CFTC in March 2022 after a decade investigating financial crime and fraud as the watchdog of a key 2009 financial crisis bailout program.\n\nDuring her tenure as Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) from 2012 to 2022, Goldsmith Romero's office brought cases and cooperated in federal enforcement actions against major corporations, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and General Motors.\n\nGoldsmith Romero also received awards from the U.S. Attorney General and Department of Justice's Criminal Division after her office uncovered a multibillion-dollar fraud, leading to jail terms for former executives at the former mortgage lender Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker and the failed Colonial Bank.\n\nIn progressive circles, she is seen as a strong fit for the FDIC role and as having the management experience and skill set necessary to help fix the agency's \"toxic\" environment, as the investigation described the FDIC, and address other challenges.\n\nThe FDIC is also grappling with the fallout of last year's bank failures, which exposed supervisory weaknesses at the regulator, and is trying to finalize a handful of contentious new rules for Wall Street banks, including major capital hikes.\n\nGoldsmith Romero's nomination, a process that usually takes months, comes at a precarious time politically, just five months ahead of the November general election.\n\nA number of Senate Democrats are up for re-election in narrow races, including Sherrod Brown who chairs the Banking Committee that must advance the FDIC nominee, making a potentially contentious confirmation process difficult to navigate. Democrats control the Senate by a single vote.\n\n\"Getting a nominee through the Senate in the summer of a presidential election year is always an uphill battle, but the toxic politics and compressed timing make this forthcoming nomination a sprint up Mount Everest,\" said Tyler Gellasch, CEO of Healthy Markets Association in Washington, a non profit focused on financial markets.\n\nGUILTY ADMISSIONS\n\nAs a CFTC commissioner, Goldsmith Romero has advocated for stronger policing of U.S. markets and stiffer penalties for misconduct.\n\nMost notably, she has pushed for the agency to secure more admissions of wrongdoing from companies when settling enforcement actions, particularly from repeat offenders.\n\n\"We've seen Wall Street banks get one enforcement action after another ... so I'm looking for a greater deterrent impact,\" she told Reuters in a 2022 interview.\n\nThat campaign was evidenced by a recent CFTC settlement with JPMorgan Chase, in which the bank admitted it broke the agency's rules.\n\nShe has also led the agency's efforts to better understand the potential impact of artificial intelligence on financial markets.\n\nPrior to being appointed SIGTARP, Goldsmith Romero was counsel to then U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairs Mary Schapiro and Christopher Cox and had investigated securities law violations.\n\nShe started her career as a law clerk at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Nevada after graduating from Brigham Young University Law School in 1995.

{"id": 231985860, "title": "Locals object to plans for 49 homes in Cambridgeshire village", "text": "Locals have shared their objections to proposals for a housing development in a Cambridgeshire village. The plans could see up to 49 new homes being built on land near The Causeway in Isleham. An outline application was put forward by Abbey Properties in April 2024. It includes four one-bed flats, 20 two-beds, 19 three-beds, five four-bed houses and one four-bed bungalow. The plans also include details on a new public open space as well as landscaping, access and associated works. The applicants say that the development hopes to bring a range of \"high quality\" and \"much-needed\" affordable housing to the site.

Others have objected due to the effects on parking, wildlife and the nearby school. One person said: \"Isleham has exploded with new developments over the past few years with absolutely zero investment into the sustainability or infrastructure of the area - it simply cannot sustain any more housing developments. The essence of the village is being destroyed which is an absolute tragedy.\" Another commented: \"The village does not have the infrastructure for more homes. Last year alone 15 children from the catchment area could not get places to the local school, due to oversubscription, and this is only getting worse each year. Adding more homes is more pressure on the already limited amenities.\" A planning statement with the application said: \"The development would contribute meaningfully to the growing need for affordable housing in Isleham and nearby communities in the District via the provision of 49 exclusively affordable units. \"Through its indicative layout, design and landscaping it would provide an attractive and complementary addition to Isleham consistent with local patterns of development and residential densities. The proposed development would result in the re-use of a currently underutilised site with nominal agricultural value. \"The proposed development will also provide a number of more general benefits to the District, including those attained through development receipts, as well as creating employment opportunities and additional training and skills development within the local economy during the construction process and for the maintenance of the development.\" A decision on the application will be made by East Cambridgeshire District Council at a later date.

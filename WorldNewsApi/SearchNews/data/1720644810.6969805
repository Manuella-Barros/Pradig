After commercial products, our fashion choices have a big impact on the environment, particularly our oceans. The fashion industry, especially fast fashion, is notorious for its detrimental effects on the planet. As we settle into summer vacations, barbecues and drinks on the patio, we have an opportunity to dress sustainably. The Problem with Fast Fashion Fast fashion is characterized by its rapid production and low-cost garments, designed to keep up with the latest trends. This business model leads to excessive waste, overconsumption, and significant environmental pollution. Much of this waste ends up in our oceans, harming marine life and ecosystems. The use of synthetic materials, which shed microplastics, further exacerbates the problem, as these tiny particles are ingested by marine animals, entering the food chain and impacting biodiversity. More than 60% of fabric fibers are fossil-derived synthetics, which cause microplastic pollution on land and in the ocean. However, brands like Two Thirds, Samara, and Wholesome Culture are leading the charge towards sustainability, offering eco-friendly alternatives that protect our oceans Two Thirds: Ocean-Friendly Fashion Two Thirds is changing is collection cycle from six to four to match the seasons. Courtesy of Two Thirds Barcelona-based Two Thirds is committed to protecting our oceans through sustainable practices. Their pre-order system produces only what is necessary, drastically cutting waste. This approach ensures that each piece of clothing has a buyer before it\u2019s made, preventing overproduction. \"Our pre-order system allows us to produce what is needed, not more. This way, we significantly reduce waste and respect our planet's resources,\" says a representative from Two Thirds. Two Thirds also uses 90% eco-friendly materials, including organic, biodegradable, and recycled options like Econyl, made from recycled fishing nets. Their focus on circularity includes using deadstock materials, such as surplus yarn and fabric, to create limited-edition collections. By reducing their annual collections from six to four, they promote conscious consumerism and align their releases with nature\u2019s seasons.

Unfortunately, many \u201cvegan\u201d and \u201ceco-friendly\u201d options really are not better for the planet. The seemingly eco-friendlier and common leather alternative for handbags \u2013 polyvinyl chloride (PVC) \u2013 is also a petroleum-based plastic that brings the same environmental impact as other synthetic materials, and it\u2019s not biodegradable. Samara is known for its minimalist and stylish designs made from innovative, eco-friendly materials like apple leather and recycled ocean plastic. Apple leather is actually circular. Companies take pulp, seeds and compost from the juice and compote industries and turn it into material. That material then can become a coin purse or handbag. Samara is also committed to cruelty-free and sustainable production. Wholesome Culture: Wear Your Values Wholesome Culture donates extra clothes to community organizations Photo credit: Wholesome Culture Wholesome Culture\u2019s apparel promotes compassion and sustainability. Their clothing is made from organic cotton and recycled materials, featuring uplifting messages and designs that resonate with eco-conscious consumers. The company also supports other organizations that are working for the planet by donating extra clothing to organizations and people who need it. The Importance of World Oceans Day World Oceans Day, celebrated annually on June 8th, raises awareness about the vital role oceans play in sustaining life on Earth. This year\u2019s theme, \u201cRevitalization: Collective Action for the Ocean,\u201d emphasizes the need for global collaboration to protect our marine environments. Brands like Two Thirds, Samara, and Wholesome Culture show that it\u2019s possible to look good while doing good. But we can also help by asking questions about the companies from which we buy. How do they source their supplies? Do the participate in circular processes? How do they reduce waste? By choosing sustainable fashion, we contribute to the health of our oceans and the planet.

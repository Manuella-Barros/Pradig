Sophie Runkee, 34, was on a summer holiday with her partner, Jj Warner, and her three children, including their 11-week-old baby. The family had jetted off to Turkey ahead of Jj undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nThe trip was to create some precious memories together after his devastating diagnosis, but their \"once-in-a-lifetime trip\" became a nightmare after Sophie's body was found on the balcony of their hotel apartment.\n\nSophie and Jj had been enjoying the last-minute trip with their children - Alicia, 14, Tommy, 9, and 11-week-old baby Luca - when, on Thursday, July 11, Sophie and Alicia went out for some mother and daughter time, reports Hull Live.\n\nThey spent the night dancing together in local bars while Jj stayed in with the boys. Jj said: \"We were all having a great time on holiday in Turkey, we wanted the kids to remember this summer for the right reasons despite everything that's going on.\"\n\nHe added: \"Sophie went out on the Thursday evening. She was upset over my diagnosis so I encouraged her to go out with Alicia to blow off some steam while I looked after the boys. She just wanted to forget about everything and have a good night with her daughter.\"\n\nIn a devastating turn of events, Alicia discovered her mum unresponsive on the balcony of their hotel. Jj, in a desperate attempt to save her, performed CPR and managed to revive her, but she remained in a critical condition and was immediately taken to hospital.\n\nDespite the medical team's efforts, she died just 24 hours later. A distraught Jj added: \"It's difficult to put into words what has happened, we're all still in shock. We were together 24-hours-a-day, we were never ever ever apart. I don't know what I will do without her. I have nobody else in my life. She was the love of my life, she was my soul mate. I don't even know how I'm going to get through this.\n\n\"We have both suffered quite abusive lives, so we understood each other on a level that nobody else can understand.\" Following Sophie's untimely death, there was speculation that she might have taken her own life, but Jj said he does not believe this is the case and has asked for people to stop speculating online.\n\nSophie and Jj were excitedly preparing for their wedding in Scotland, which they had moved forward due to his skin cancer diagnosis. Now, Jj faces his battle with cancer and raising their three children alone.\n\nHe added: \"This holiday was supposed to create amazing memories for the kids so they don't remember this summer as being about what I'm currently going through and now they've lost their mum. My only concern is looking after them kids. They have lost their mother, their world, while on holiday in a strange country and then in three weeks, I start cancer treatment. They don't deserve any of this.\"\n\nHe also paid a moving tribute to Sophie's parenting: \"Sophie might have had her faults, as we all do, but she was a phenomenal mother.\" Tragically, Sophie did not have travel insurance, and now Jj is confronted with mounting hospital expenses and the costs to repatriate \"the love of his life\" back to Hull for her funeral. To assist with the financial burden, Sophie's best mate Jenny Phillips has initiated a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nIn a poignant tribute to his fiancee, Jj wrote: \"My darling angel, the love of my life, nothing will never be the same.

However, this \"once-in-a-lifetime trip\" took a dire turn when Sophie's lifeless body was discovered on the balcony of their hotel room.\n\nFor their impromptu getaway, Sophie and Jj were accompanied by their children - eldest Alicia aged 14, Tommy at nine years, and an 11-week-old baby named Luca. On Thursday, July 11, amidst merry vacationing, Sophie and Alicia sought some quality mother-daughter time, as reported by Hull Live.\n\nThe duo decided to spend their night rejoicing at local bars with dance and revelry while Jj remained back attending to the boys.

Sophie, along with her partner Jj Warner, had whisked their three kids away for a summer getaway before Jj's impending cancer treatment, aiming to craft unforgettable moments for the children amidst his grim diagnosis.\n\nTragically, what was meant to be a \"once-in-a-lifetime trip\" descended into horror when Sophie was discovered unresponsive on their hotel apartment balcony, suspected of losing consciousness and choking following a night out.\n\nThe couple had been seizing the joy of their spontaneous break with their brood - Alicia, 14, Tommy, 9, and 11-week-old Luca. On that fateful Thursday, July 11, Sophie took Alicia out for some quality time, leaving Jj to care for the boys as they danced the night away at local bars.\n\nJj recounted the bittersweet moments: \"We were all having a great time on holiday in Turkey, we wanted the kids to remember this summer for the right reasons despite everything that's going on.\", reports Yorkshire Live\n\n.\n\n\"Sophie went out on the Thursday evening. She was upset over my diagnosis so she decided to go out with Alicia to blow off some steam while I looked after the boys. She just wanted to forget about everything and have a good night with her daughter.\"\n\n\"She had an excessive amount to drink. She came back and collapsed on the balcony outside, she was sick and choked on her vomit.\"\n\nIn a heartbreaking turn of events, it was Alicia who discovered her mother unresponsive. Jj quickly arrived on the scene, cleared her airways and initiated CPR.\n\nHe managed to revive her, but her pulse was weak and she was immediately rushed to hospital.\n\nStay updated with all the latest and breaking news in Yorkshire by subscribing to our newsletter here.\n\nRegrettably, despite their best efforts, the doctors were unable to save her and she passed away 24 hours later. A devastated Jj shared: \"It's difficult to put into words what has happened, we're all still in shock. Sophie wasn't just my wife, she was my best friend.\"\n\n\"We were inseparable, together 24-hours-a-day. I can't imagine life without her. She was my everything, my soul mate. I don't even know how I'm going to get through this.\"\n\n\"We both had quite abusive pasts, so we understood each other on a level that nobody else could.\"\n\nSophie and Jj were set to tie the knot in Scotland in just six weeks, having brought the wedding forward due to his skin cancer diagnosis. Now, he faces the daunting task of raising their family alone while battling cancer.\n\n\"This holiday was meant to create wonderful memories for the kids so they wouldn't associate this summer with my current health struggles, and now they've lost their mum,\" he lamented.\n\n\"My only concern is looking after them kids - if I die they have got nobody.

They don't deserve any of this.\"\n\n\"Sophie might have had her faults, as we all do, but she was a phenomenal mother.\"\n\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of her death Sophie's travel insurance are unlikely to cover the soaring bills. And so now Jj has been hit with the unexpected hospital bills as well as the cost of getting \"the love of his life\" back home to Hull where she can be laid to rest.\n\nSophie's best friend Jenny Phillips has set up a GoFundMe with hopes to help raise the funds for this, as well as support Jj and the children.\n\nIn a heartbreaking tribute to Sophie, Jj said: \"My darling angel, the love of my life, nothing will never be the same.

You will always be their mum, nobody will ever be able to take your place.\"\n\nFollowing her tragic passing, whispers began to spread around their hometown of Hull suggesting that Sophie had committed suicide.

They have lost their mother, their world, while on holiday in a strange country and then in three weeks, I start cancer treatment. They don't deserve any of this. Sophie might have had her faults, as we all do, but she was a phenomenal mother.\"\n\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of her death, Sophie's travel insurance is unlikely to cover the soaring bills. Now, JJ faces unexpected hospital expenses along with the cost of bringing \"the love of his life\" back home to Hull for her final resting place. To help with these expenses and support JJ and the children, Sophie's best friend Jenny Phillips has set up a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nPaying heartbreaking tribute to Sophie, JJ said: \"My darling angel, the love of my life, nothing will never be the same. You will be forever in our hearts, we will miss you forever, I will be laid to rest with you when it's my time and we will be together again. Until then I promise to take care of our babies for the rest of my life, and try and do as good a job as you did. You will always be their mum, nobody will ever be able to take your place.\"\n\nFollowing Sophie's death, rumours circulated in Hull suggesting she had taken her own life. The GoFundMe campaign set up for JJ has been closed, and all donations have been refunded to contributors. Additionally, the travel insurance claim was denied due to the circumstances of her untimely passing.\n\nThe GoFundMe description has been updated to read: \"Guys I so so sorry for all the mess around everyone has now been refunded for the original go fund page and it has been closed, plz check your emails for your refund and plz plz from the bottom of my heart please help me I've got people chasing me for hospital bill Iv kids to sort and try get through this and that's only 2 percent of my issues after this devastating loss!!!\n\n\"To pay the hospital and fly her home is going to be over 6 thousand pounds plus funeral costs. Sophie's partner has 3 young kids with him in Turkey and a fundraiser already set up is being refused to him,EDIT this has now been closed and refunded to every single person who donated. Please help this family in this urgent time , this money will go directly to jj and then children.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_gogarty@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Conor Gogarty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "rashi_agarwal@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Rashi Agarwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Hull", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kingston upon Hull"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston upon Hull"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33281977.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Sophie-Runkee-kids-01JPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746729", "eventUri": "eng-9746729", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 565, "textEnd": 572}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The holiday was to ensure the kids enjoyed good memories together after receiving the devastating diagnosis.\n\nBut the 'memory making' trip took a devastating turn after Sophie's lifeless body was found on the balcony of their hotel apartment following a night out.\n\nREAD MORE: Chaos and violence on the streets as Leeds riot sees double decker bus burned and riot police 'attacked'\n\nSophie and JJ had been enjoying their trip with Alicia, 14, Tommy, 9, and baby Luca, when, on Thursday 11th July, Sophie and Alicia went out dancing at some local bars while JJ remained at the hotel with the boys.\n\nJJ said: \"We were all having a great time on holiday in Turkey, we wanted the kids to remember this summer for the right reasons despite everything that's going on.\n\n\"Sophie went out on the Thursday evening. She was upset over my diagnosis so I encouraged her to go out with Alicia to blow off some steam while I looked after the boys. She just wanted to forget about everything and have a good night with her daughter.\"\n\nTragically, after their night out, it was Alicia who found her mother unresponsive. JJ rushed over and cleared her airways before beginning CPR, managing to restore a weak pulse before she was rushed to hospital.\n\nSadly, there was nothing more the doctors could do to save her, and Sophie passed away 24 hours later.\n\nSpeaking of losing 'the love of his life', JJ continued: \"It's difficult to put into words what has happened, we're all still in shock.\n\n\"We were together 24-hours-a-day, we were never ever ever apart. I don't know what I will do without her. I have nobody else in my life. She was the love of my life, she was my soul mate. I don't even know how I'm going to get through this.\n\n\"We have both suffered quite abusive lives, so we understood each other on a level that nobody else can understand.\"\n\nFollowing Sophie's death, rumours circulated that she had taken her own life, which JJ wants to make clear that he believes this was not the case and urged people to stop speculating on social media.\n\nThe couple were due to be married in Scotland in just six weeks, after bringing the wedding forward following his skin cancer diagnosis.

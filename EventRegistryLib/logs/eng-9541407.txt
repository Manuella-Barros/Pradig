The bets ranged in size from $15 to $22,000. Porter did not play in any of the games included in the bets, according to the NBA, but three of the wagers were parlays with the Raptors to lose. Porter's bets on the NBA totaled $76,059, with a net win of $21,965, according to the league.\n\nThe NBA prohibits players from betting on the league or any of its properties.\n\nGambling industry sources said Porter maintained accounts with legal sportsbooks in Colorado, including with FanDuel from 2021 to 2023. The sources said Porter did not place wagers on the NBA during the time he had a FanDuel account. Porter was not playing in the NBA at the time, and his FanDuel account was suspended in the middle of 2023, before he signed his first two-way contract, according to an industry source. The source said Porter's account was flagged during the sportsbook's routine know-your-customer financial checks and was permanently suspended.\n\nBefore a March 20 game between the Sacramento Kings and Raptors, an unidentified associate of Porter's placed an $80,000 same-game parlay bet featuring the under on several of Porter's statistics that would have paid out $1.1 million, according to the NBA. Porter played just three minutes before being taken out of the game, citing an illness.\n\nSportsbooks also reported suspicious betting activity on the under on Porter's statistics in a Jan. 26 game between the Raptors and LA Clippers. Porter played just four minutes in that game before leaving with issues related to an eye injury suffered earlier in the week against the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nThe NBA said it has shared information with federal prosecutors, and sources familiar with the issue said the investigation continues.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-way contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2022/12/facebook-og-1200630.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541407", "eventUri": "eng-9541407", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 1375, "textEnd": 1383}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-20", "textStart": 2770, "textEnd": 2778}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-26", "textStart": 3202, "textEnd": 3209}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Ever since the introduction of legal sports betting to several US states in 2018, the NBA has been working closely with sportsbooks and integrity services agencies in order to always have effective monitoring and reporting systems in place.\n\nCommissioner Adam Silver's decision to ban Porter from the NBA came after an investigation revealed that Porter had disclosed confidential information to individuals involved in sports betting and had placed bets on games in violation of league rules.\n\nAccording to revelations during the investigation, now-former Toronto Raptors center Porter adjusted his game performance to benefit sports betting in at least one of his matches.\n\nAdditionally, it was uncovered that Porter had also made at least 13 bets on NBA games with wagers totaling over $76,000.

On the more extreme side of the spectrum, sources said that not allowing bets on the \"under\" on a player prop has been considered too.\n\nPorter now infamously disclosed confidential information about his health to a betting associate, who proceeded to place an $80,000 wager that he would underperform his prop markets in a March 20 game. Porter then pulled himself out of that game against the Sacramento Kings after allegedly becoming ill.\n\nThat $80,000 bet would've paid $1.1 million but was frozen and the NBA was alerted to the suspicious activity by the sportsbook operator and watchdog firm US Integrity.\n\nLegal sports betting has come under fire in recent months. Shohei Ohtani is embroiled in a gambling scandal, many states have moved to ban college player prop bets, and the Porter controversy in the NBA is just the icing on the cake for the industry's strained public image.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver made some comments when the league handed down Porter's ban that made our own Geoff Zochodne curious about how he'd use his influence to enact certain changes to how legal bets are placed on his sport.\n\nSilver said in a statement:\n\n\"While legal sports betting creates transparency that helps identify suspicious or abnormal activity, this matter also raises important issues about the sufficiency of the regulatory framework currently in place, including the types of bets offered on our games and players. Working closely with all relevant stakeholders across the industry, we will continue to work diligently to safeguard our league and game.\"\n\nZochodne pointed out how Silver's sentiments are tying into the NBA's further discussions about changing the betting catalog because, after all, it was a sudden surge in interest in Porter's props that led to the ban.\n\nAccording to Zochodne, this raises a big question for the NBA that falls along the lines of:\n\nDo people really need to bet on players like Jontay Porter? (a player on a two-way contract that averaged a minimal 14 minutes a game with just 4.4 points and 3.2 rebounds per night).\n\nThe sportsbooks cited in ESPN's article -- BetMGM, FanDuel, and DraftKings -- refused to comment on today's matter, but it would seem that operators will need to start getting ahead of these dilemmas before they happen -- whether that's regarding advertising, betting catalogs, player involvement, or otherwise -- in order to avoid further scrapes to the industry's credibility.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jontay_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jontay Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-way contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proposition bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/87533abc-6a47-4ee0-9cc7-286db957a1ec.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541407", "eventUri": "eng-9541407", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-20", "textStart": 1507, "textEnd": 1515}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

There's a large pool of players in college whose careers will end after they participate in college athletics, so there's not as much at stake. There's clearly a lot more at stake for a superstar player than there is for a two-way player.\n\n\"So it goes to the kinds of players those bets can be placed on, and then the types of bets as well. Certainly, prop bets, depending on how precise they are, lend themselves to more shenanigans than other kind of bets. Now, some of that can be captured through various monitoring, but we also recognize that a large amount of the handle -- I'm not sure the precise percentage -- but my hunch is there's still far more illegal [betting] than legal.\n\n\"There are limits to our control, but we think there should be a regulated framework, where it's the leagues working together with the state oversight groups and the betting companies, whether or not we have partnerships with them. In some cases we have partnerships with, just take DraftKings and FanDuel, where we don't have absolute control, but when we have a marketing partnership with those companies we have a lot more say than with companies where we have no partnership whatsover. Then we're relying on them doing a broader based concern about integrity in the industry and them not running afoul of the regulators.\"\n\nWhile Porter's ban was the most substantial betting-related story of the season, it was far from the only one.\n\nPlayers and coaches around the league reported multiple incidents in which fans harassed them at games or on social media about bets. Cleveland Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff even said that disgruntled gamblers tracked down his phone number and sent him threatening messages.\n\nNow that sports betting has been legalized in many states around the country, partnerships have generated millions and millions of dollars for the league. It's clear, though, that there are plenty of negatives associated with the gambling world, and the NBA still has a lot of work to do to keep its employees safe and regulate the practice.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_maloney@cbssports.com", "name": "Jack Maloney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jontay_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jontay Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proposition bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/06/b40b219b-fe3b-4f50-94c5-6a3870cdb4d2/thumbnail/1200x675/6f2769fa46b5500734251e7f5bb36579/adam-silver-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541407", "eventUri": "eng-9541407", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Throughout the track, Lil Nas X, 25, recites confidence-building lyrics such as, \"Move tell them make room / tell them make a way / tell them make a hole / Tell them boys they better hide / tell them lay low / tell them play it safe cause we don\u2019t play at all.\" Lil Nas X previously called the track one of the \"best\" songs he's ever created. \"So excited to release the best song of all time this friday! also sorry I\u2019ve been so scared with my art lately. I\u2019m coming around to myself again. I will make you guys very proud,\" he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday, June 25. He echoed similar sentiments in an interview with Netflix, in which he expressed that working on the track was \"actually kind of insane\" and made him \"a bit emotional.\" \"I\u2019m happy to do it. I hope I\u2019m not slaughtered by people who love the original,\" he added while sitting down with some of the film's stars, including Eddie Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

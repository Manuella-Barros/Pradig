Greg Abbott on Wednesday directed the Texas public university systems and community colleges to not comply with a new rule change implemented by the Biden administration related to Title IX.\n\nThe latest directive comes after Abbott said last week that the state will not comply and he instructed the Texas Education Agency not to do so.\n\nTexas also sued the administration over the rule change last week, as did multiple states, The Center Square reported, arguing it is illegal.\n\nAt issue is the Biden administration's Department of Education rewriting the Title IX statute to expand the definition of \"sex\" to include \"gender identity.\"\n\nTitle IX, which is part of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, states, \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\n\nTitle IX was created to prohibit discrimination against women in all educational programs that receive federal money, including K-12 schools, colleges and universities. The new rule redefines biological sex and requires schools to allow men and boys, claiming to be women and girls, respectively, to use female-only facilities and join female-only sports or lose federal funding.\n\n\"As I have already made clear, Texas will not comply with President Joe Biden's rewrite of Title IX that contradicts the original purpose and spirit of the law to support the advancement of women,\" Abbott wrote to chairmen and regents statewide. \"Last week, I instructed the Texas Education Agency to ignore President Biden's illegal dictate of Title IX. Today, I am instructing every public college and university in the State of Texas to do the same.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"I signed laws to ensure the safety of our students on campus and provide a process for adjudicating reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault with adequate due process for all parties involved, as well as laws to protect the integrity of women's sports by prohibiting men from competing against female athletes - and I will not let President Biden erase the advancements Texas has made.\"\n\nAbbott sent the letter to Texas A&M University System, Texas Southern University, Texas State University System, Texas Tech University System, Texas Women's University System, University of Houston System, University of North Texas System, and University of Texas System, and to all Texas community colleges.\n\nHe did so after Texas A&M's school paper, The Battalion, wrote in a May 1 article that it was \"scrambling\" to implement changes to comply with the new rule change. One week later, The Battalion article appears to have been rewritten and includes a link to the governor's letter and a statement from the university saying it was reversing course.\n\nAssociate Vice President of Communications Kelly Brown said, A&M \"anticipate[s] rulings from one or more federal courts in the very near future. In the meantime, please be advised that the A&M System will not take any action to implement the new federal regulations.\"\n\nOver the past few years, Abbott and the Texas legislature have taken several actions to protect girls' sports.\n\nLast year, Abbott signed a new bill into law, the Save Women's Sports Act, to protect the integrity of fair competition and women's sports. It prohibits biological men from competing against biological female athletes at Texas colleges and universities.\n\nIn 2021, Abbott signed a similar bill into law to protect girls' sports in Texas public schools. In the legislative sessions of 2017 and 2019, he signed four bills into law to address student safety and adjudication processes for reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault on college campuses.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Today, I instructed Texas public colleges and universities to ignore this illegal rewrite.\n\nRead more: https://www.newsweek.com/greg-abbott-defies-joe-biden-order-ignore-new-law-1898733", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher Education Act of 1965"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_transgender_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal status of transgender people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553590", "eventUri": "eng-9553590", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-01", "textStart": 574, "textEnd": 582}, {"amb": false, "date": "2009-05-", "textStart": 28, "textEnd": 34, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Greg Abbott on Wednesday directed the Texas public university systems and community colleges to not comply with a new rule change implemented by the Biden administration related to Title IX.\n\nThe latest directive comes after Abbott said last week that the state will not comply and he instructed the Texas Education Agency not to do so.\n\nTexas also sued the administration over the rule change last week, as did multiple states, The Center Square reported, arguing it is illegal.\n\nAt issue is the Biden administration's Department of Education rewriting the Title IX statute to expand the definition of \"sex\" to include \"gender identity.\"\n\nTitle IX, which is part of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, states, \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\n\nTitle IX was created to prohibit discrimination against women in all educational programs that receive federal money, including K-12 schools, colleges and universities. The new rule redefines biological sex and requires schools to allow men and boys, claiming to be women and girls, respectively, to use female-only facilities and join female-only sports or lose federal funding.\n\n\"As I have already made clear, Texas will not comply with President Joe Biden's rewrite of Title IX that contradicts the original purpose and spirit of the law to support the advancement of women,\" Abbott wrote to chairmen and regents statewide. \"Last week, I instructed the Texas Education Agency to ignore President Biden's illegal dictate of Title IX. Today, I am instructing every public college and university in the State of Texas to do the same.\n\n\"I signed laws to ensure the safety of our students on campus and provide a process for adjudicating reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault with adequate due process for all parties involved, as well as laws to protect the integrity of women's sports by prohibiting men from competing against female athletes - and I will not let President Biden erase the advancements Texas has made.\"\n\nAbbott sent the letter to Texas A&M University System, Texas Southern University, Texas State University System, Texas Tech University System, Texas Women's University System, University of Houston System, University of North Texas System, and University of Texas System, and to all Texas community colleges.\n\nHe did so after Texas A&M's school paper, The Battalion, wrote in a May 1 article that it was \"scrambling\" to implement changes to comply with the new rule change. One week later, The Battalion article appears to have been rewritten and includes a link to the governor's letter and a statement from the university saying it was reversing course.\n\nAssociate Vice President of Communications Kelly Brown said, A&M \"anticipate[s] rulings from one or more federal courts in the very near future. In the meantime, please be advised that the A&M System will not take any action to implement the new federal regulations.\"\n\nOver the past few years, Abbott and the Texas legislature have taken several actions to protect girls' sports.\n\nLast year, Abbott signed a new bill into law, the Save Women's Sports Act, to protect the integrity of fair competition and women's sports. It prohibits biological men from competing against biological female athletes at Texas colleges and universities.\n\nIn 2021, Abbott signed a similar bill into law to protect girls' sports in Texas public schools. In the legislative sessions of 2017 and 2019, he signed four bills into law to address student safety and adjudication processes for reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault on college campuses.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bethany_blankley@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Bethany Blankley",

Greg Abbott released a letter on Wednesday \"instructing\" the state's higher education leaders to ignore revisions made to Title IX, a federal law prohibiting public schools from discriminating based on sex. Rep. Nathaniel Moran spoke in Congress claiming East Texans are against the new regulations.\n\nMoran spoke to Congress on Tuesday, claiming the new regulations, which are set to take effect on Aug. 1, are an attack on women's sports. Moran said that East Texans feel the new rules are \"an inexcusable federal assault towards girls and women that has no place in schools.\" Moran said Title IX rule is immoral and offensive to women across the country.\n\nTitle IX, a regulation imposed by the U.S. Department of Education, \"strengthens vital protections for students in our nation's schools and provides clear rule to help schools meet their Title IX obligation to eliminate sex discrimination in their education programs and activities.\"\n\nAccording to Moran, Van ISD said in a letter, \"the changes to Title IX forces schools to treat boys as if they were girls and to accept every student's self declared gender identity.\" KETK's request to Van ISD for the full letter has not yet been returned.\n\nThe final regulations, according to the Department of Education, include:\n\nProtect against all sex-based harassment and discrimination: The final rule would protect employees and students from sex discrimination by restoring full protection from sexual violence and other sex-based harassment. This would also protect against discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characterizes.\n\nPromote accountability and fairness: This would provide accountability by requiring schools to take swift action to end any sex discrimination in their programs and activities. Schools would be required to respond to all sex discrimination complaints with transparent and reliable process to evaluate all evidence.\n\nEmpower and support students and families: The final rule would protect against retaliation for students and employees, requiring schools to communicate their nondiscrimination polices and procedures to all parties involved so that students and families understand their rights.\n\nIn April 2023, Moran voted for the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023, and said Title IX's ignorance of biological differences between males and females would threaten women's opportunity in sports, undermining it's efforts for equality.\n\n\"Earlier this month, the Biden Administration proposed new Title IX rules that would prohibit public schools and universities from banning male athletes from competing in sporting events with girls and women,\" Moran said. \"The proposed Biden rule would likewise prohibit states from protecting the integrity of women's and girls' sports. This ruling would prevent women and girls from competing on a level playing field in sports and it ignored the biological differences between men and women.\"\n\nIn June 2023, Abbott also signed legislation prohibiting transgender women and girls from competing in collegiate athletics. Save Women's Sports Act, also known as S.B. 15, mandates that intercollegiate athletes only participate in sports that matches their \"biological sex\" which the legislation defines that as what is stated on a student's original birth certificate.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Moran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Moran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trans woman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Allies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Allies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2024/05/2024-05-09_050907-225x188.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553590", "eventUri": "eng-9553590", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-01", "textStart": 449, "textEnd": 455}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Cardona in which six states (Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia and West Vriginia) sued the Biden administration over the Title IX rule change.\n\nMiquel Cardona, secretary of the United States Department of Education, is the named defendant in the case.\n\n\"Intervenors have a strong interest to defend state laws and school policies that protect them. Their constitutional and statutory rights are also at stake,\" stated the memorandum.\n\n\"Students, teachers, and female athletes experience the on-the-ground harms inflicted by the Department's rewrite of Title IX. Intervenors also raise common questions of law and fact and their intervention will not cause undue delay or prejudice.\"\n\nThe motion argues that redefining sex discrimination to include gender identity \"won't just affect state funding and preempt state laws\" but also \"means young girls will be forced to undress in front of boys in gym class, teenage girls will share bedrooms with teenage boys on overnight school trips, teachers and students will refrain from speaking about gender identity, and girls will fall behind in sports again.\"\n\nOn April 29, the Department of Education released a final rule, scheduled to take effect on Aug. 1, which defines Title IX's ban on \"sex discrimination\" to include \"sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\"\n\nThe Education Department's final rule argues that the measures \"aim to fulfill Title IX's protection for students, teachers, and other employees in federally funded elementary schools and secondary schools and postsecondary institutions against all forms of sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment and sexual violence.\"\n\n\"The final regulations will help to ensure that all students receive appropriate support when they experience sex discrimination and that recipients' procedures for investigating and resolving complaints of sex discrimination are fair to all involved,\" stated the final rule.\n\n\"These final regulations also better account for the variety of recipients and education programs or activities covered by Title IX and provide discretion and flexibility for recipients to account for variations in school size, student populations, and administrative structures.\"\n\nAlthough the U.S. Department of Education claims that the new regulations do not apply to participation on athletic teams as it plans to issue a separate \"final rule\" to address sex-segregated sports in Title IX, the attorneys general of Florida, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina refuted that claim in an 84-page lawsuit.\n\nThe attorneys general contend that the department's redefinition of sex discrimination under Title IX apply to sex-segregated facilities despite a regulation allowing them.\n\n\"It applies that new definition because it thinks the restroom regulation is invalid to the extent it requires all students to use the restroom that corresponds to their biological sex,\" the lawsuit stated. \"But the Department thinks the exact same thing about the regulation governing same-sex athletics. In other words, the Department claims to permit women's sports, so long as women's sports are open to men.\"\n\n\"The rule thus requires -- or will predictably coerce -- schools to allow biological males to compete on athletic teams for women or girls, denying female students equal athletic opportunities, playing time, and fair competition,\" the suit continued. \"And it concededly affects sports by changing the rule for sex-separated locker rooms.\"", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ron DeSantis said in a video posted to X. \"We will not comply, and we will fight back.\"\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in a letter to the White House last month his state will not be implementing the changes, either.\n\n\"Title IX was written by Congress to support the advancement of women academically and athletically,\" the letter states. \"The law was based on the fundamental premise that there are only two sexes -- male and female. You have rewritten Title IX to force schools to treat boys as if they were girls and to accept every student's self-declared gender identity.\"\n\nOther conservative lawmakers, like Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, said fellow Republican officials refusing to abide by the Biden administration's revisions to Title IX \"undermines the rule of law\" and encouraged GOP states to fight back using the courts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I don't think it's ever a good idea to skip the legal process,\" Skrmetti told Fox News Digital last week.\n\nThe new rules revised the ways in which sexual harassment and assault claims are adjudicated on campus.\n\nRILEY GAINES SLAMS NEW TITLE IX PROTECTIONS AS THE 'MOST ANTI-WOMAN' PURSUIT OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION\n\nUnder the revision, sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Schools are prohibited from separating people based on their biological sex, except in limited circumstances, under the provisions and critics say that the change will permit transgender people in locker rooms and bathrooms that oppose the sex appearing on their birth certificate.\n\nLGBTQ+ students who face the new standards of \"discrimination\" will be entitled to a response from their school under Title IX, and those failed by their schools can seek recourse from the federal government.\n\nMissing from the new rule, however, is a policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes competing against biological females.\n\nFox News' Joshua Q Nelson contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"},

Last August, its board voted to require notification of parents if students identify as transgender or ask to use pronouns different from their biological sex.\n\nCameron Samuels, who graduated from one of the Katy ISD high schools in 2022, filed a complaint about the policy with the federal government.\n\nThe DOE's Civil Rights Office responded by opening a probe against the district earlier this week, for \"discrimination on the basis of sex or disability,\" according to local media.\n\n\"I hope this can help set an example to other school boards across the country that are trying to pass similar policies,\" Kadence Carter, a transgender 17-year-old who left the school district after the policy was enacted, told reporters on Monday.\n\nKaty ISD has denied any wrongdoing and says it was \"committed to offering equal educational opportunities to our entire community.\"\n\nThe Department of Education's move comes just weeks after the Biden administration redefined sex discrimination under Title IX of the federal Civil Rights Act to include \"sex stereotypes, pregnancy, gender identity and sexual orientation.\"\n\nThe new rules are supposed to take effect in August, but Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, has already instructed schools in his state to disregard them.\n\n\"Congress wrote Title IX to protect women. [President Joe] Biden, with no authority to do so, rewrote Title IX to protect men who identify as women,\" Abbott said last month. He called the new rules an \"illegal dictate\" that violated Texas laws that prohibit men competing in women's sports.\n\nThe Katy policy, adopted by the board of trustees in a 4-3 vote, requires students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that \"correspond with their biological sex,\" bans district employees from discussing gender-related issues with students, allows teachers to refuse requests to call students by pronouns that do not reflect their biological sex, and requires administrators to notify parents or guardians of such requests or transgender identifications.\n\n\"Using pronouns is a way of social-transitioning children. We're protecting them from that,\" school board president Victor Perez said at a board meeting last summer.\n\nThe district made about 20 such notifications in the first few months since the policy was adopted, according to local media. Carter was the only student who cited the policy as the reason for moving out of the district.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Independent_School_District", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Katy Independent School District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/663d166d2030275d4411b832.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553590", "eventUri": "eng-9553590", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The report found that inadequate oversight of Title IX negatively impacts women from participating in college athletics.\n\nUnder Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act of 1972, schools that receive federal financial aid are required to provide students with an equal opportunity to participate in sports, use facilities, and obtain scholarship aid.\n\nUnfortunately, according to data received through the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, the GAO found that in the academic year 2021-2022, women's athletic participation rate was 14 percent lower than their enrollment rate, and in that same year, 40 percent of colleges had fewer varsity sports for women to participate in. This means that enrolled female students who wished to play varsity sports were unable to do so because the college or university did not provide the sport or did not have the resources to accommodate it.\n\n\"Every student who wants to play a sport in college should have a fair and equal opportunity to do so,\" said Ranking Member Scott. \"Regrettably, today's GAO report confirms that while female college enrollment numbers outpace male enrollment, opportunities for female athletes significantly lag behind their male counterparts. We should be doing all we can to close this gap. I am grateful the Biden Administration is updating Title IX regulations, and I look forward to improved enforcement by the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights to address these inequities.\"\n\n\"Title IX sets a standard of equal opportunity that too many schools have failed to meet. This new report from the GAO shows that women enroll in college at a higher rate than men but consistently participate in college athletics at a lower rate than men,\" said ECESE Subcommittee Ranking Member Bonamici. \"I appreciate the steps the Biden administration has taken to strengthen Title IX protections, and I will continue to work with Ranking Member Scott and my other colleagues to advance the policies and resources needed for every student to have a meaningful opportunity to participate in sports -- regardless of their gender.\"\n\n\"This critical study on equity in college athletics brings to light the inequities that girls and women in sport continue to face, over 50 years after the enactment of Title IX. It has been our mission at the VOICEINSPORT Foundation to fight for gender equity in sport and close the gaps highlighted in this study, and we are pleased that the release of these findings will finally focus national attention on the actions that need to be taken to reignite progress for girls and women in sport. The GAO's finding that about two-thirds of American universities are failing to provide women with equitable opportunities to participate in athletics should be a jarring wake-up call to schools and the Department of Education. We applaud the work of the GAO on this study and hope that their recommendations are implemented and further action is taken to challenge the inequities young women are currently facing in athletics,\" said Stef Strack, Founder VOICEINSPORT Foundation.\n\nThe Education Department's Office of Civil Rights is responsible for ensuring colleges meet their Title IX obligations. However, the GAO found that inconsistent oversight practices made it difficult for institutions to address issues or make adjustments to their student athletic programs.\n\nTo read the full GAO report entitled, College Athletics: Education Should Improve Its Title IX Enforcement Efforts, click here.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Bonamici", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Bonamici"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_member", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ranking member"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equal opportunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government Accountability Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Varsity team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_3rd_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 3rd congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York's_1st_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York's 1st congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Education_and_the_Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Civil_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Office for Civil Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Governing_Bodies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Governing Bodies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Research_Funding", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Research Funding", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Organizations", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553590", "eventUri": "eng-9553590", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

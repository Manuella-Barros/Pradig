{"id": 227476736, "title": "After 33 years, Batavia barber&#8217;s annual 24-hour haircutting fundraiser still going strong", "text": "For Tim Casey of Geneva, getting a regular haircut isn\u2019t an unusual thing, but the goal of his latest shearing was to help someone else. \u201cI started coming to this event in 2004 or so. it\u2019s been 20 years,\u201d Casey said as he stood outside the Foltos Tonsorial Parlor in Batavia on Friday during its annual Chop Around the Clock fundraising event. \u201cIt\u2019s always a good event and does so much for the community and it\u2019s fun \u2026 I love coming down here.\u201d Beginning at 4 p.m. Friday and running through 4 p.m. Saturday, Craig Foltos, 71, owner of the barber shop at 7 E. Wilson St., again offered a 24-hour, non-stop haircutting party, a tradition that began 33 years ago. The annual, iconic fundraiser has steadily grown over the decades and has raised nearly $400,000 for Ronald McDonald\u2019s Children\u2019s Charities, a feat that even Foltos says has surpassed his expectations. \u201cThis has gone far beyond what I thought would happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has helped me develop as a person far more than I ever thought, and I enjoy seeing the people that are regulars and show up every year to help out. It\u2019s been far better than I ever anticipated.\u201d The event began, he said, after realizing his own future appeared to be fairly secure. \u201cI was at a place in my life where I could see that things were going to be good and I thought \u2013 how could I help somebody else because, maybe, I\u2019ve been pretty fortunate to get to this point,\u201d Foltos said a few days before the event. \u201cI was watching the \u2018Dick Van Dyke Show\u2019 and they had that bit where he stayed up all night on a radio show and I said, \u2018Hey, what if stayed up all night cutting hair?\u2019\u201d Casey noted the iconic nature of the fundraiser \u201cis what draws people and when I\u2019ve brought people here they just think it\u2019s terrific.\u201d The event again included food giveaways including hot dogs and tacos, music and hundreds of donated items that were raffled off. Foltos was aided by two women who work with him who he said would be taking shifts giving haircuts along with him during the event. Chris Bowers of Sandwich said she has worked with Foltos for 33 years and has been to all of the Chop Around the Clock events. \u201cI look forward to seeing Craig do something nice for the community and all the people that get involved every year,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s always good people and good food.\u201d Steve Schoeling of North Aurora said he has come to a number of Chop Around the Clock events, electing to get a haircut as well as donating food for the event. \u201cLast year it was chili and the year before it was pulled pork shoulder so it\u2019s whatever he (Foltos) wants,\u201d Schoeling said Friday afternoon after the event officially started. \u201cI was a culinary student who graduated about 15 years ago and was a personal chef so I just like to use my skill sets to help out. I\u2019ve been coming here the past 12 years or so as a customer. I love coming here ever since I found the place.\u201d The late-night hours during the 24-hour event have produced some humorous moments over the years, Foltos said, \u201conce the restaurants and the bars close down.\u201d \u201cAt midnight some years it\u2019s just packed with people or there are others that like coming here and they\u2019ll just come late,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to twist somebody\u2019s arm to eat chocolate. For some people, coming down here is their chocolate. They\u2019ll come down here and laugh. But there are some that stop in and perhaps were overserved and got their head shaved and wonder the next morning what they did.\u201d Foltos said along with raising money for a good cause, the annual event is also a way to reconnect with people and hopefully encourage them to act in a way that helps others. \u201cFirst, I enjoy the friends that show up every year but I hope that, in some place in somebody\u2019s life they\u2019ll go, \u2018I remember that guy that did this and I can do this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t all chip in then it all just goes away. I hope it inspires people.\u201d David Sharos is a freelance reporter for The Beacon-News.", "summary": "The Chop Around the Clock fundraising event at the Foltos Tonsorial Parlor raises money for charity while also offering food, music and of course haircuts.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/02/after-33-years-batavia-barbers-annual-24-hour-haircutting-fundraiser-still-going-strong/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ABN-L-CHOPCLOCK-0602-01.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:32", "author": "David Sharos", "authors": ["David Sharos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.216}

He was 75.\n\nThe author and editor of nine books, Biale was considered a trailblazer in the fields of Jewish studies and Jewish history, challenging existing assumptions about who should and shouldn't be included in the academic canon. Drawing on the methods of the 20th-century historian Gershom Scholem -- the subject of his doctoral thesis at Hebrew University in Jerusalem -- he described counterhistory as \"the discovery of vital forces precisely in what others have considered marginal, disreputable, and irrational.\"\n\nBiale once said he was inspired to write a book when someone commented that it was a \"bad topic.\"\n\nThe result of such contrarianism were important books on the themes as diverse as power, sexuality, secularization, blood and mysticism in Jewish history and culture. They include \"Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History\" (1979), \"Power and Powerlessness in Jewish History\" (1986) and \"Cultures of the Jews: A New History\" (2002), all three of which won the National Jewish Book Award.\n\nIn \"Eros and the Jews: From Biblical Israel to Contemporary America\" (1992), Biale explored the diverse and often contradictory messages about sexuality conveyed in Jewish culture, from the Book of Ruth and Yiddish literature to the memoirs of founding Zionists and the films of Woody Allen. A reviewer predicted it would become \"a standard reference\" on the topic, which it did.\n\n\"Rigorous in method, delicate in touch, Biale sheds light on corners of history that others deemed marginal or taboo, inviting us to engage in an exploration of 'counterhistory' that remains directly at the field's heart,\" Sarah Abrevaya Stein, a Jewish studies professor at UCLA, wrote in a blurb for Biale's 2023 collection, \"Jewish Culture Between Canon and Heresy.\"\n\nBiale was the Emanuel Ringelblum Distinguished Professor of Jewish History at the University of California, Davis, whose history department he joined in 1999. An alumnus of UC Berkeley and UCLA, he was previously the Koret Professor of Jewish History and director of the Center for Jewish Studies at Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, From 1977 until 1986, he coordinated the Jewish studies program at what is now New York's Binghamton University.\n\nIn addition to his academic work, Bible was a self-described Jewish activist who wrote op-eds and signed petitions from a liberal Zionist perspective. In an essay from March 2023, he lamented that Israel's ruling Likud party had drifted \"toward a kind of authoritarianism.\"\n\nBiale was born July 25, 1949, in Los Angeles, the son of Jacob Bialoglowski, an immigrant from Poland who became a professor of agriculture at UCLA, and Evelyn Karol, a daughter of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants who came to the United States before World War I. The family spent a year in Israel when Biale was 9 and his father was an agricultural consultant to the young state. Upon returning to California, Biale was active in a Labor Zionist group co-founded by his father.\n\nIn his teens he attended the Brandeis Alonim Summer Camp (now known as the Brandeis-Bardin Institute), a training ground for future Jewish scholars and activists.\n\nAfter attending Harvard University for a year, he returned to California to be part of the counterculture and intellectual ferment at UC Berkeley, a center for student anti-Vietnam War protests and the Free Speech movement. There he helped found the Radical Jewish Union and published the \"Jewish Radical,\" a Jewish student newspaper whose contributors, he once wrote, included \"so-called New Left people who believe that you can be leftists and also pro-Israel.\"\n\nOpposing Israel's presence in the West Bank\n\nIn the summers he volunteered at a kibbutz in Israel and joined demonstrators who opposed Israel's burgeoning \"occupation of the West Bank\" following the Six-Day War. He also met his future wife, Rachel Korati, now a clinical social worker and author of adult and children's books. The pair were also collaborators: In 2021 they co-wrote \"Aerograms Across the Ocean,\" a collection of the correspondence they shared during this period, and they also worked together to resurrect a cherished Jewish learning initiative in the Bay Area after it folded.\n\nBiale's UCLA dissertation on Scholem became the first book-length study of the historian and thinker. Pleased by the attention, Scholem, then 80, told an interviewer on Israeli television, \"You see, in California, they are writing about me.\"\n\nAt a conference this spring at the GTU Center for Jewish Studies, Biale, who had been diagnosed with cancer, shared his reflections on mortality.\n\n\"To be alive is to be constantly in communion with the dead, with those who have been alive but are no longer,\" Biale told the audience. \"I cry for those I will leave behind, especially friends and family, and how all those generations that have gone before beckon me to join them. Death forces us to see ourselves for what we are, tiny specks in a vast universe, living infinitesimally short lives in astronomical time.\"\n\nBiale is survived by Rachel Biale, his son Noam,

Death forces us to see ourselves for what we are, tiny specks in a vast universe, living infinitesimally short lives in astronomical time.\"\n\nBiale is survived by Rachel Biale, his son Noam, daughter Tali and several grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_silow_carroll@jta.org", "name": "Andrew

And at least when it comes to the U.S. team, Jewish athletes are taking center stage -- even if, so far, they aren't faring particularly well.\n\nSix of the 20 athletes on the U.S. team are Jewish or come from Jewish families -- not quite a minyan, but still a feat given that just 2.4% of Americans are Jewish. Seven-time Olympic U.S. coach Yury Gelman is also Jewish.\n\nEach athlete took a different path to the team, so there's no single explanation for why Jews are disproportionately represented in fencing. But the sport has a rich Jewish history, as well as unusual strength in Russia and the former Soviet Union, where several of the Jewish fencers have roots. Plus, the sport can be hard to access outside of major population centers, where American Jews tend to live.\n\nMitchell Saron, 23, who competes in sabre, said he thought the Jewish presence on the U.S. team \"sounds like a lot.\" But he noted that because of fencing's lower profile compared to other sports, people tend to get into fencing through word of mouth.\n\n\"I think if you hear someone from your tribe is getting to fence here or there, that can spread very fast,\" said Saron, who is both Filipino American and Jewish, grew up in New Jersey and graduated from Harvard University this year.\n\nIn addition to Saron, these are the other Jewish fencers on this year's squad:\n\nElizabeth Tartakovsky, 24, who picked up sabre fencing in the United States from her great-uncle, Gelman. Both of her grandfathers are Jewish, and her parents emigrated from Kyiv in the early 1990's. \"Yury is the closest family we have in the U.S.,\" she said. The 2022 NCAA sabre champion and 2023 individual world championship bronze medalist hails from Livingston, New Jersey, and also fenced at Harvard; she's making her Olympic debut in Paris.\n\nEli Dershwitz, 28, who is returning for his third Olympics. He made the 2016 Rio Olympic team after his freshman year at Harvard. As a junior, he won his second consecutive NCAA sabre title and became the first male fencer in the United States to finish a season ranked No. 1 in the world. He briefly considered retiring after the Tokyo Olympics at age 25 but stayed in the game. Last year, Dershwitz became the first American man to win an individual senior world championship title in sabre.\n\nNick Itkin, 24, a two-time NCAA foil champion at the University of Notre Dame, who was introduced to fencing by his Jewish father, Misha, who also emigrated from Ukraine and opened a fencing club in Los Angeles. Under his father's guidance, Itkin became a four-time world championship medalist and a 2020 Olympic silver medalist in foil -- the best showing ever for an American man.Itkin traveled with his father to Israel in 2022. \"I can't say that I'm very much involved in the Jewish religion, but my father, it's a huge part of his identity so obviously I grew up experiencing the culture and the religion,\" he told the Sporting Tribune in May. \"When we visited Israel, it was one of his goals, to bring his family there. It meant a lot to him.\"\n\nMaia Weintraub, 21, who won gold at the 2019 European Maccabi Games for Jewish athletes. Weintraub took a year from her studies at Princeton University to train for the Olympics. \"I was able to really focus on my fencing and not let school bog me down, especially finals,\" said the 2022 NCAA women's individual foil champion from Philadelphia. She stayed on campus to train with her college team and landed a job working in a lab researching mosquitos -- which is something of a family business. Weintraub's Jewish father, Jason, is an entomologist who specializes in moths and butterflies.\n\nJackie Dubrovich, 29, of Maplewood, New Jersey, who is competing in her second games after narrowly missing a medal in team foil in Tokyo four years ago. Dubrovich graduated from Columbia University in 2016 where she studied, among other things, Russian literature as a nod to her first language and her parents who both emigrated from Belarus in the late 1980's.\n\nDershwitz, Dubrovich and Saron lost early matches this weekend, knocking them out of individual competition, while their U.S. teammates Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs took home medals. Meanwhile, Yuval Freilich, the first Israeli man to become a European fencing champion, also lost in a surprise upset in his first match.\n\nThe athletes all follow in a long tradition of Jewish fencers. The sport was particularly popular among upwardly mobile Jewish students in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was seen as a way to assert strength amid antisemitism. Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, was trained as a fencer and was famously inspired to write an early essay about antisemitism after watching a duel between a Jew and a non-Jew in France.\n\nThe affinity of Jews for fencing has fueled an extensive Olympic medal count, spanning several countries. Many of the Jewish winners took the podium in the years leading up to World War II, including all three of the women's winners in 1936 in Berlin. (One, Helene Meyer, openly supported the Nazis.) While some used the sport to escape the Nazis, others were murdered during the Holocaust, including the Hungarian gold medalist Attila Petschauer, whose brutal murder inspired part of the 1999 movie \"Sunshine,\" starring Ralph Fiennes.\n\nThat so many of the Jewish fencers have roots in Russia reflects the long tail of a different cultural moment, the mass emigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union after its fall. Russia has long been a powerhouse in fencing (though it is banned from Olympic competition this year because of its invasion of Ukraine) and many Jewish athletes found success in the sport there. In fact, the first Olympic champion in the history of Soviet individual fencing, Grigorii Kriss in 1964, was Jewish. When Jews left en masse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many, such as Gelman and Itkin's father Misha, took their passions and skills with them -- which some of their children have now inherited.\n\nThe heyday of Jewish fencers could be winding down. Gelman, who was a top fencer in his native Kyiv and now owns Manhattan Fencing Center in the Garment District, said he has noticed fewer and fewer Jews coming up through the ranks of the sport.\n\n\"I don't know why,\" Gelman said. \"But for sure it's much less.\"\n\nFor now, the Jewish fencers are all focused on the present, not the future of their sport. In particular, Itkin hopes to be the first U.S. male fencer to take the top ranking in foil.\n\nAt the last Olympics, in Tokyo, Itkin said, \"all my [foil] teammates were older than me. I was 21 and they were winning everything. They took me under their wing and now we're really close. We've never been more motivated to finally get this Olympic gold medal.\"\n\nAnd they recognize the significance of their participation in fencing competitions in places -- including Paris -- where they would have faced persecution in the past.\n\n\"I feel a tremendous amount of pride being able to compete for the U.S., often in the country that my grandparents left,\" Dershwitz said. He recalled bringing teammates along on a quest to locate the grave of one his great-grandparents when he competed in -- and won -- the 2015 junior world championship in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\n\n\"They couldn't have imagined a situation in which I've gotten to compete on the world stage in a crowd that maybe didn't want them there 100 years ago, but now they're cheering for you, want the best for you, and consider you one of their own,\" Dershwitz said. He added, \"My parents tell me that my grandparents would be proud.\"", "source": {"uri": "jweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "J."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(UC Davis; University of California Press)\n\n(JTA) -- David Biale, a professor of Jewish history who wrote award-winning books about heretics, free-thinkers, radicals and the marginalized in a method he called \"counterhistory,\" died Sunday of cancer. He was 75.\n\nThe author and editor of nine books, Biale was considered a trailblazer in the fields of Jewish studies and Jewish history, challenging existing assumptions about who should and shouldn't be included in the academic canon. Drawing on the methods of the 20th-century historian Gershom Scholem -- the subject of his doctoral thesis at Hebrew University in Jerusalem -- he described counterhistory as \"the discovery of vital forces precisely in what others have considered marginal, disreputable, and irrational.\"\n\nBiale once said he was inspired to write a book when someone commented that it was a \"bad topic.\"\n\nThe result of such contrarianism were important books on the themes as diverse as power, sexuality, secularization, blood and mysticism in Jewish history and culture. They include \"Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History\" (1979), \"Power and Powerlessness in Jewish History\" (1986) and \"Cultures of the Jews: A New History\" (2002), all three of which won the National Jewish Book Award.\n\nIn \"Eros and the Jews: From Biblical Israel to Contemporary America\" (1992), Biale explored the diverse and often contradictory messages about sexuality conveyed in Jewish culture, from the Book of Ruth and Yiddish literature to the memoirs of founding Zionists and the films of Woody Allen. A reviewer predicted it would become \"a standard reference\" on the topic, which it did.\n\n\"Rigorous in method, delicate in touch, Biale sheds light on corners of history that others deemed marginal or taboo, inviting us to engage in an exploration of 'counterhistory' that remains directly at the field's heart,\" Sarah Abrevaya Stein, a Jewish studies professor at UCLA, wrote in a blurb for Biale's 2023 collection, \"Jewish Culture Between Canon and Heresy.\"\n\nBiale was the Emanuel Ringelblum Distinguished Professor of Jewish History at the University of California, Davis, whose history department he joined in 1999. An alumnus of UC Berkeley and UCLA, he was previously the Koret Professor of Jewish History and director of the Center for Jewish Studies at Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.\n\nIn addition to his academic work, Bible was a self-described Jewish activist who wrote op-eds and signed petitions from a liberal Zionist perspective. In an essay from March 2023, he lamented that Israel's ruling Likud party had drifted \"toward a kind of authoritarianism.\"\n\nBiale was born July 25, 1949, in Los Angeles, the son of Jacob Bialoglowski, an immigrant from Poland who became a professor of agriculture at UCLA, and Evelyn Karol, a daughter of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants who came to the United States before World War I. The family spent a year in Israel when Biale was 9 and his father was an agricultural consultant to the young state. Upon returning to California, Biale was active in a Labor Zionist group co-founded by his father.\n\nIn his teens he attended the Brandeis Alonim Summer Camp (now known as the Brandeis-Bardin Institute), a training ground for future Jewish scholars and activists.\n\nAfter attending Harvard University for a year, he returned to California to be part of the counterculture and intellectual ferment at UC Berkeley, a center for student anti-Vietnam War protests and the Free Speech movement. There he helped found the Radical Jewish Union and published the \"Jewish Radical,\" a Jewish student newspaper whose contributors, he once wrote, included \"so-called New Left people who believe that you can be leftists and also pro-Israel.\"\n\nIn the summers he volunteered at a kibbutz in Israel and joined demonstrators who opposed Israel's burgeoning occupation of the West Bank following the Six-Day War. He also met his future wife, Rachel Korati, now a clinical social worker and author of adult and children's books. The pair were also collaborators: In 2021 they co-wrote \"Aerograms Across the Ocean,\" a collection of the correspondence they shared during this period, and they also worked together to resurrect a cherished Jewish learning initiative in the Bay Area after it folded.\n\nBiale's UCLA dissertation on Scholem became the first book-length study of the historian and thinker. Pleased by the attention, Scholem, then 80, told an interviewer on Israeli television, \"You see, in California, they are writing about me.\"\n\nAt a conference this spring at the GTU Center for Jewish Studies, Biale, who had been diagnosed with cancer, shared his reflections on mortality.\n\n\"To be alive is to be constantly in communion with the dead, with those who have been alive but are no longer,\" Biale told the audience. \"I cry for those I will leave behind, especially friends and family, and how all those generations that have gone before beckon me to join them. Death forces us to see ourselves for what we are, tiny specks in a vast universe, living infinitesimally short lives in astronomical time.\"\n\nBiale is survived by Rachel Biale, his son Noam, daughter Tali and several grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_silow_carroll@jta.org", "name": "Andrew

A new movement to unite Israel advocates across the world has formed, called 'One Jewish State,' that seeks to strengthen Israel and the Jewish people. One Jewish State is an outgrowth of Israel365 Action, which has been at the forefront of Israel advocacy since October 7th, and has partnered with Ambassador David Friedman, who has called for a new movement that is based on peace through strength. \"I am flattered that they have chosen the name of my book for their new party, and am flattered they have endorsed my views and the movement I have begun to lead,\" said Friedman.\n\nIn addition to organizing Israel advocates, One Jewish State will host online and local events and has registered as a party in the World Zionist Congress. The World Zionist Congress is the \"parliament of the Jewish people\" since its founding in 1897 by Theodore Herzl, and holds elections every five years. The next World Zionist Congress election is scheduled for March 2025. \"Zionism today has become a dirty word. Antisemitism is out of control. On October 7th, Israelis were massacred and now, Jews don't feel safe anywhere in the world,\" said Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, director of Israel365 Action. \"While the World Zionist Congress incredibly helped build the state of Israel, we have lost the vision necessary to steer the Jewish State into the future. One Jewish State has bold views that are very different from the failed policies that led to October 7th.\" One Jewish State calls for working closely with Israel's faith based allies, for revitalizing Jewish education and for sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.\n\nSince the World Zionist Congress elections will be held in March 2025, One Jewish State is seeking party delegates to serve as representatives. \"We already have some of the most incredible Jewish activists as delegates,\" said Rabbi Tuly Weisz, founder of Israel365. \"I am blown away by the dedication, commitment and courage of so many young Jews who have applied to become delegates. This is not the party for Jews with trembling knees, but we are the home for all kinds of Jews who want to be a part of ensuring a strong, safe and sovereign Israel.\"\n\nTo apply to become a One Jewish State delegate, visit the website here.\n\nOne Jewish State delegates Anna Steinberg and Elisheva Reiss from Chicago, flew to Washington, DC to hear Prime Minister Netanyahu and were attacked by pro Hamas mobs. \"I can't believe what is going on in our nation's capital,\" said Steinberg, \"and I feel that getting involved with One Jewish State is the best way to have a big impact on the future of Israel and the Jewish people.\" Other delegates include Michelle Terris, founder of JEXIT (Jews exiting the Democratic party), WABC host of \"Sid and Friends\" Sid Rosenberg, social media influencer Melissa Chapman, Josh Hammer, Newsweek's senior editor at large, Matthew Faraci of Gideon300, and Benji Gershon, founder of American Jewish Conservatives.\n\nTheir motto, 'One Jewish People for One Jewish State' encapsulates the diversity of its delegates. Cary Kozberg is a reform rabbi, Pinchas Taylor is a Chabad rabbi and Josh Wander is a rabbi who defies all labels, all of whom serve as One Jewish State delegates. Rabbi Josh Wander (who lives in Israel but didn't vote in the previous Knesset election and therefore is eligible to serve as a delegate) will serve as the director of Aliyah affairs for One Jewish State and sees his involvement as a way to raise awareness about the importance of Aliyah. \"We are at a crossroads in Jewish history where God is literally closing down the exile on all fronts and gathering his people back home. I am flattered to represent One Jewish State in its efforts to return the Jewish people back to their ancestral homeland.\"\n\nOne Jewish State recognizes that some of its positions might be jarring for some in the largely liberal American Jewish community, but that is okay with its leadership. \"October 7th woke us all up to the harsh reality that we can't continue with the same naive ideologies and failed policies, like the two state solution,\" said Rabbi Wolicki. \"We need a grassroots movement to push the Jewish community into confronting the new reality we are facing. If you want to be a part of the new movement that will turn Zionism from a curse word into a beloved term that connotes respect, then we are your One Jewish State.\"", "source": {"uri": "israel365news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel365 News | Latest News.

And at least when it comes to the U.S. team, Jewish athletes are taking center stage -- even if, so far, they aren't faring particularly well.\n\nSix of the 20 athletes on the U.S. team are Jewish or come from Jewish families -- not quite a minyan, but still a feat given that just 2.4% of Americans are Jewish. Seven-time Olympic U.S. coach Yury Gelman is also Jewish.\n\nEach athlete took a different path to the team, so there's no single explanation for why Jews are disproportionately represented in fencing. But the sport has a rich Jewish history, as well as unusual strength in Russia and the former Soviet Union, where several of the Jewish fencers have roots. Plus, the sport can be hard to access outside of major population centers, where American Jews tend to live.\n\nMitchell Saron, 23, who competes in sabre, said he thought the Jewish presence on the U.S. team \"sounds like a lot.\" But he noted that because of fencing's lower profile compared to other sports, people tend to get into fencing through word of mouth.\n\n\"I think if you hear someone from your tribe is getting to fence here or there, that can spread very fast,\" said Saron, who is both Filipino American and Jewish, grew up in New Jersey and graduated from Harvard University this year.\n\nIn addition to Saron, these are the other Jewish fencers on this year's squad.\n\nDershwitz, Dubrovich and Saron lost early matches this weekend, knocking them out of individual competition, while their U.S. teammates Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs took home medals. Meanwhile, Yuval Freilich, the first Israeli man to become a European fencing champion, also lost in a surprise upset in his first match.\n\nThe athletes all follow in a long tradition of Jewish fencers. The sport was particularly popular among upwardly mobile Jewish students in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was seen as a way to assert strength amid antisemitism. Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, was trained as a fencer and was famously inspired to write an early essay about antisemitism after watching a duel between a Jew and a non-Jew in France.\n\nThe affinity of Jews for fencing has fueled an extensive Olympic medal count, spanning several countries. Many of the Jewish winners took the podium in the years leading up to World War II, including all three of the women's winners in 1936 in Berlin. (One, Helene Meyer, openly supported the Nazis.) While some used the sport to escape the Nazis, others were murdered during the Holocaust, including the Hungarian gold medalist Attila Petschauer, whose brutal murder inspired part of the 1999 movie \"Sunshine,\" starring Ralph Fiennes.\n\nNow, that so many of the Jewish fencers have roots in Russia reflects the long tail of a different cultural moment, the mass emigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union after its fall. Russia has long been a powerhouse in fencing (though it is banned from Olympic competition this year because of its invasion of Ukraine) and many Jewish athletes found success in the sport there. In fact, the first Olympic champion in the history of Soviet individual fencing, Grigorii Kriss in 1964, was Jewish. When Jews left en masse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many, such as Gelman and Itkin's father Misha, took their passions and skills with them -- which some of their children have now inherited.\n\nThe heyday of Jewish fencers could be winding down. Gelman, who was a top fencer in his native Kyiv and now owns Manhattan Fencing Center in the Garment District, said he has noticed fewer and fewer Jews coming up through the ranks of the sport.\n\n\"I don't know why,\" Gelman said. \"But for sure it's much less.\"\n\nFor now, the Jewish fencers are all focused on the present, not the future of their sport. In particular, Itkin hopes to be the first U.S. male fencer to take the top ranking in foil.\n\nAt the last Olympics, in Tokyo, Itkin said, \"all my [foil] teammates were older than me. I was 21 and they were winning everything. They took me under their wing and now we're really close. We've never been more motivated to finally get this Olympic gold medal.\"\n\nAnd they recognize the significance of their participation in fencing competitions in places -- including Paris -- where they would have faced persecution in the past.\n\n\"I feel a tremendous amount of pride being able to compete for the U.S., often in the country that my grandparents left,\" Dershwitz said. He recalled bringing teammates along on a quest to locate the grave of one his great-grandparents when he competed in -- and won -- the 2015 junior world championship in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\n\n\"They couldn't have imagined a situation in which I've gotten to compete on the world stage in a crowd that maybe didn't want them there 100 years ago, but now they're cheering for you, want the best for you, and consider you one of their own,\" Dershwitz said. He added, \"My parents tell me that my grandparents would be proud.\"", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And at least when it comes to the U.S. team, Jewish athletes are taking center stage -- even if, so far, they aren't faring particularly well.\n\nSix of the 20 athletes on the U.S. team are Jewish or come from Jewish families -- not quite a minyan, but still a feat given that just 2.4% of Americans are Jewish. Seven-time Olympic U.S. coach Yury Gelman is also Jewish.\n\nEach athlete took a different path to the team, so there's no single explanation for why Jews are disproportionately represented in fencing. But the sport has a rich Jewish history, as well as unusual strength in Russia and the former Soviet Union, where several of the Jewish fencers have roots. Plus, the sport can be hard to access outside of major population centers, where American Jews tend to live.\n\nMitchell Saron, 23, who competes in sabre, said he thought the Jewish presence on the U.S. team \"sounds like a lot.\" But he noted that because of fencing's lower profile compared to other sports, people tend to get into fencing through word of mouth.\n\n\"I think if you hear someone from your tribe is getting to fence here or there, that can spread very fast,\" said Saron, who is both Filipino American and Jewish, grew up in New Jersey and graduated from Harvard University this year.\n\nIn addition to Saron, these are the other Jewish fencers on this year's squad.\n\nElizabeth Tartakovsky, 24, who picked up sabre fencing in the United States from her great-uncle, Gelman. Both of her grandfathers are Jewish, and her parents emigrated from Kyiv in the early 1990's. \"Yury is the closest family we have in the U.S.,\" she said. The 2022 NCAA sabre champion and 2023 individual world championship bronze medalist hails from Livingston, New Jersey, and also fenced at Harvard; she's making her Olympic debut in Paris. Eli Dershwitz, 28, who is returning for his third Olympics. He made the 2016 Rio Olympic team after his freshman year at Harvard. As a junior, he won his second consecutive NCAA sabre title and became the first male fencer in the United States to finish a season ranked No. 1 in the world. He briefly considered retiring after the Tokyo Olympics at age 25 but stayed in the game. Last year, Dershwitz became the first American man to win an individual senior world championship title in sabre. Nick Itkin, 24, a two-time NCAA foil champion at the University of Notre Dame, who was introduced to fencing by his Jewish father, Misha, who also emigrated from Ukraine and opened a fencing club in Los Angeles. Under his father's guidance, Itkin became a four-time world championship medalist and a 2020 Olympic silver medalist in foil -- the best showing ever for an American man.Itkin traveled with his father to Israel in 2022. \"I can't say that I'm very much involved in the Jewish religion, but my father, it's a huge part of his identity so obviously I grew up experiencing the culture and the religion,\" he told the Sporting Tribune in May. \"When we visited Israel, it was one of his goals, to bring his family there. It meant a lot to him.\"\n\nJackie Dubrovich of team United States speaks during a press event ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games on July 24, 2024 in Paris. (Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nMaia Weintraub, 21, who won gold at the 2019 European Maccabi Games for Jewish athletes. Weintraub took a year from her studies at Princeton University to train for the Olympics. \"I was able to really focus on my fencing and not let school bog me down, especially finals,\" said the 2022 NCAA women's individual foil champion from Philadelphia. She stayed on campus to train with her college team and landed a job working in a lab researching mosquitos -- which is something of a family business. Weintraub's Jewish father, Jason, is an entomologist who specializes in moths and butterflies. Jackie Dubrovich, 29, of Maplewood, New Jersey, who is competing in her second games after narrowly missing a medal in team foil in Tokyo four years ago. Dubrovich graduated from Columbia University in 2016 where she studied, among other things, Russian literature as a nod to her first language and her parents who both emigrated from Belarus in the late 1980's.\n\nDershwitz, Dubrovich and Saron lost early matches this weekend, knocking them out of individual competition, while their U.S. teammates Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs took home medals. Meanwhile, Yuval Freilich, the first Israeli man to become a European fencing champion, also lost in a surprise upset in his first match.\n\nThe athletes all follow in a long tradition of Jewish fencers. The sport was particularly popular among upwardly mobile Jewish students in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was seen as a way to assert strength amid antisemitism. Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, was trained as a fencer and was famously inspired to write an early essay about antisemitism after watching a duel between a Jew and a non-Jew in France.\n\nThe affinity of Jews for fencing has fueled an extensive Olympic medal count, spanning several countries. Many of the Jewish winners took the podium in the years leading up to World War II, including all three of the women's winners in 1936 in Berlin. (One, Helene Meyer, openly supported the Nazis.) While some used the sport to escape the Nazis, others were murdered during the Holocaust, including the Hungarian gold medalist Attila Petschauer, whose brutal murder inspired part of the 1999 movie \"Sunshine,\" starring Ralph Fiennes.\n\nA life-size image of the Olympic winner in fencing Helene Mayer is on display in front of the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, 26 July 2015. The image was part of a display about Jewish athletes in German sports, produced in conjunction with the 2015 Maccabi Games (Soeren Stache/picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nNow, that so many of the Jewish fencers have roots in Russia reflects the long tail of a different cultural moment, the mass emigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union after its fall. Russia has long been a powerhouse in fencing (though it is banned from Olympic competition this year because of its invasion of Ukraine) and many Jewish athletes found success in the sport there. In fact, the first Olympic champion in the history of Soviet individual fencing, Grigorii Kriss in 1964, was Jewish. When Jews left en masse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many, such as Gelman and Itkin's father Misha, took their passions and skills with them -- which some of their children have now inherited.\n\nThe heyday of Jewish fencers could be winding down.

The topics of his scholarly inquiry ranged from Jewish secularism and Hasidism to sex and power in Jewish history.\n\nBut the longtime Berkeley resident was more than the sum of his academic achievements. He was one of those rare scholars beloved by other academics. He was known for his generosity of spirit, for mentoring younger scholars and for offering undergraduates a kind ear. He was a man people felt privileged to call their friend.\n\n\"He was my closest friend,\" said neighbor Martin Dodd, a Berkeley lawyer who met David when their oldest children were in kindergarten together at Tehiyah Day School in El Cerrito. \"For someone who was as accomplished an intellectual as he was, he was the most down-to-earth person. He could talk about anything. He had an endless fascination with everybody and everything. He was genuinely interested in people, and that's why people loved to be around him. I was forever enriched by knowing him.\"\n\nBiale, who retired three years ago as the Emanuel Ringelblum Distinguished Professor of History at UC Davis, died peacefully at home in his sleep on Sunday after battling metastatic prostate cancer. His two children and his wife of 51 years, Rachel, were at his side. He was 75.\n\n\"He's known as one of the great intellectual Jewish historians in the world,\" said Fred Rosenbaum, the founder of Lehrhaus Judaica and a close friend of Biale since their days as graduate students in Jewish studies at UC Berkeley in the mid-1970s. \"But more than that was David as a person. He influenced my life more than any other friend, just by the way he lived his life.\"\n\nBiale was born in Los Angeles in 1949. His father, Jacob, a member of the Jewish youth movement Hashomer Hatzair, came from Poland in 1929 to study agriculture at UC Davis in preparation for moving to British Mandate Palestine. Instead, he became a professor at UCLA, where he met and married Evelyn, Biale's mother, in 1945.\n\nBiale began college at Harvard in 1968, but friends at UC Berkeley regaled him with stories of their activism and the political fervor in Berkeley at the time. Biale asked his dean for a year off to attend Cal, and the dean agreed, saying \"You'll be back. They all come back.\"\n\nHe didn't. At Cal, he was among the founders of the Radical Jewish Union, a student group that patterned itself after early 20th-century Labor Zionists, setting himself on a path of secular Zionist activism he maintained for the rest of his life.\n\n\"He was an unapologetic left-wing Zionist who was critical of many Israeli governments and their policies,\" his wife told J. \"Berkeley was the place he was meant to be.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1970, Biale visited Israel, where he met 17-year-old Rachel on Kfar Ruppin, the kibbutz where she was born and raised. Introduced by a mutual friend, the two were immediately drawn together by their mutual love of Jewish history and philosophy, and they spent impassioned hours in intense conversation.\n\nBiale returned to Berkeley in the fall, and the two continued their conversations in letters that, Rachel said, \"pretty quickly became very intense.\" She began her military service in the Israel Defense Forces, and he began working on his master's degree at Cal. The letters continued for almost three years, more than 250 of them.\n\nIn 2022, the couple published them in a book, \"Aerogrammes Across the Ocean: A Love Story in Letters.\"\n\nThey married in 1973 on her kibbutz and moved to Los Angeles where he began his Ph.D. work at UCLA.\n\n\"I was 20 and David was 23 when we married,\" said Rachel. \"We really grew up together. The way we merged into each other's professional and intellectual work was incredible. We read everything the other wrote.\"\n\n\"Their marriage was exceptional,\" said Rosenbaum. \"They were really destined for each other.\"\n\nIn 1977 David earned his Ph.D. and got a job offer from the State University of New York at Binghamton. The couple lived there for nine years and had two children along the way: Noam in 1982 and Tali in 1985.\n\nIn 1986, David was offered a job in Jewish studies at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley. Although the couple was eager to return to Berkeley, Rachel said that David was reluctant to work at GTU because it was a religious institution. \"At his interview, he was asked, 'Which synagogue will you worship at?' And he said, 'None,'\" she recalled.\n\nHe got the job.\n\nDavid was the director of Jewish studies at GTU until 1999, when UC Davis recruited him with the offer of an endowed chair in Jewish studies, the position he held until his retirement in 2022.\n\n\"He really flourished there,\" said Rachel. \"He loved teaching, he loved his students, especially those who were the first generation in their family to go to college. Lots of students would come talk to him about their personal struggles.\"\n\nThat concern for students was one of the things that Naomi Seidman most admired. Now a professor at the University of Toronto, Seidman replaced Biale at the helm of Jewish studies at GTU when he left.\n\nSeidman said that up-and-coming academics often reach out to established figures for career advice and help. Usually, Seidman said, their pleas are ignored. Biale was an exception.\n\n\"David was always meeting them for coffee or going on walks with them. He was always excited about some young, fascinating person he'd just met, so interested in what the next generation is doing.\"\n\nSven-Erik Rose, director of Jewish studies at UC Davis, said that Biale was remarkable for the breadth of his intellect and scholarly interests.\n\n\"He was able to get into the weeds as well as write broad, compelling narratives of incredible sweep, which is rare in an age of increasing specialization,\" Rose said. \"He was an incredible intellect.\"\n\nBiale wasn't afraid to take on established notions in Jewish history and dismantle them, or at least scrutinize them carefully.\n\nRose points to Biale's analysis of an oft-repeated trope that modern Israel represents the first time since 70 CE that Jews have held political power -- an idea that Biale took on in his 1986 book, \"Power and Powerlessness in Jewish History.\"\n\nSteven Zipperstein, Biale's friend for 50 years and the Daniel E. Koshland Professor of Jewish Culture and History at Stanford, said that Biale's approach to his scholarly work was in line with what UCLA history professor Amos Funkenstein, their mutual teacher, \"insisted were the prerequisites of a real Jewish historian, namely that one write about all aspects of the Jewish past. That's what David tried to do.\"\n\nZipperstein said that Biale was able to both insert himself into his writing and remain outside it, scrutinizing his own work in a dispassionate manner that served the material well.\n\n\"Although he held very distinct convictions of what was most important in Jewish culture, as in 'Not in the Heavens: The Tradition of Jewish Secular Thought,' he understood how certain aspects of Jewishness he personally might not take seriously in his own life were crucial to Jewish people in the past and present, as in the incredible volume 'Hasidism: A New History,'\" Zipperstein told J.\n\n\"The fact that he did not enter into this as a career, but as someone intent on scrutinizing his own culture, is what gave his work its freshness, its provocativeness and its beauty,\" Zipperstein added\n\nIn addition to his scholarly work, Biale was deeply involved in Jewish issues that mattered to him.\n\nHe served on the regional board of the New Israel Fund in its early days and was board president of Jewish Family & Community Services East Bay for several years in the early 1990s.\n\nMore recently, in 2021 he and Rachel resurrected Lehrhaus Judaica. The Jewish adult learning program, established in 1974 in Berkeley by Rosenbaum, had precipitously announced its closure in summer 2021, a mere three years after Rosenbaum's retirement.\n\nNow known as New Lehrhaus, the revived nonprofit, is flourishing, in large part because of the largely unpaid role played by the Biales.\n\nBiale was also an avid bicyclist. For years he commuted by train from Berkeley to UC Davis, riding his bike to and from the station, rain or shine.\n\nDodd recalled how, in 1999, Biale persuaded him to train with him for the 2000 California AIDS ride, a grueling trek from San Francisco to Los Angeles to raise money for AIDS research. They both bought Bianchi bikes, the \"Eros\" model, which was not coincidentally a playful reference to Biale's 1997 book on Jewish sexuality, \"Eros and the Jews: From Biblical Antiquity to Contemporary America.\"\n\n\"We were Team Eros,\" Dodd said. \"He was just a font of enthusiasm about everything, the places he went, the people he met.\"\n\nThe two kept up weekly rides until the cancer weakened Biale too much to continue.\n\nBiale was also a lifelong avid bread baker, fond of sharing his sourdough starter with friends. A week before he died, he gave some to his friend James Gracer, who had served with him on the JFCS board.\n\n\"He aged but he never grew old,\" Zipperstein noted. \"There was always that boyish excitement that he never lost.\"\n\nWhen Biale received his cancer diagnosis four years ago, he and Rachel faced it head-on. He fought hard, undergoing experimental treatments and bringing his friends along on the journey he was taking toward the end of his life through regular email updates that went into great emotional and physical detail.\n\n\"He taught us a lot in the way he passed away,\" said Rosenbaum. \"I was so in awe of the courage, grace and thoughtfulness with which he faced the end.\"\n\n\"He felt it was a journey he was on, and he wanted people to share it with him,\" said Dodd. \"He was so unselfish in giving of himself. I felt privileged to be along for the ride.\"\n\nBiale is survived by his wife, Rachel Biale; his daughter Tali Biale (Willie Adams) and son Noam Biale (Margaret Graham); and grandchildren Rosemary, Abraham and Milo. He was preceded in death by his granddaughter Anina Biale.\n\nA memorial service is set for 10 a.m. Tuesday at the Magnes Museum in Berkeley (also available on Zoom), followed by burial at Gan Shalom in Orinda. Shiva will take place Wednesday through Sunday at the Biale home in Berkeley.

Most locations will welcome visitors from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n\nSeveral sites will offer additional programs for visitors, including guided tours, storytelling for children, and other activities.\n\nTo make it easier for visitors to navigate, the organizers have developed a mobile application that provides detailed information about each site.\n\nThe Jerusalem Synagogue (Jeruzal\u00e9msk\u00e1 synagoga), the largest synagogue in Prague, will also be part of the event.\n\nThere is a smartphone app and an interactive map to help visitors.

Many others are well-maintained and can also be visited.\n\nThe Day of Jewish Monuments initiative is organized by the Jewish community in Prague in collaboration with Matana, the administrative body for Jewish buildings and cemeteries and the Federation of Jewish Communities in Czechia.", "source": {"uri": "praguemorning.cz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Prague Morning"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prague_morning@praguemorning.cz", "name": "Prague Morning", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Synagogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Translate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://praguemorning.cz/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Day-of-Jewish-Monuments-czechia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773643", "eventUri": "eng-9773643", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 20}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

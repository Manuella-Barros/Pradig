{"id": 223697444, "title": "Paul O\u2019Donovan and Fintan McCarthy finish third in World Cup lightweight double sculls", "text": "O\u2019Donovan and McCarthy had lost to Switzerland in the semi-final, and the final looked like a great chance for revenge on Jan Schaeuble and Raphael Ahumada Ireland. While Italy made the early running, the Swiss-Ireland battle behind them was close and fascinating. In previous years, Italy has shown the propensity to \u2018fly and die\u2019, but now that the combative Gabriel Soares has joined Stefano Oppo in the crew, they are racier \u2013 and they proved it again in Lucerne. In the white heat of the final stages they held on to their lead, and Ireland could not quite catch Switzerland to take silver. O\u2019Donovan and McCarthy were competing together for the first time this season; McCarthy was injured for the European Championships. For years, O\u2019Donovan has balanced medical studies with rowing to amazing effect in both areas. This skill of producing their best performances on the biggest stage will be tested in the run-up to Paris 2024. Saturday had brought gold for lightweight sculler Siobh\u00e1n McCrohan and silver for pararower Tiarn\u00e1n O\u2019Donnell. Five A Finals on the Sunday brought just two bronze medals. The women\u2019s pair matched O\u2019Donovan and McCarthy with third in their final. Again, it was a podium finish in a tough event; again the rowers, Fiona Murtagh and Aifric Keogh, will be disappointed not to have done better. The Netherlands are the world champions and they overcame early steering difficulties to command the race. Australia were the main challengers and took silver, while Ireland had a poor second 500 metres and had to shake off Greece to take third. Zoe Hyde and Alison Bergin looked the next best prospect for a place on the podium, but despite starting in the favoured lane three because of their semi-final win, the Ireland double never got a hold of their final. China were unlikely early leaders. Australia and the United States took over, reversing that order for gold and silver. Ireland struggled to establish themselves in third, but that honour went to Norway. Fifth and sixth placings for, respectively, the women\u2019s lightweight double of Aoife Casey and Margaret Cremen and the men\u2019s pair of John Kearney and Ross Corrigan were just about what was expected, given that both crews have not been competing. The double were racing together for the first time this season as Casey had been ruled out through illness \u2013 the pair for the first time as a unit, as Kearney replaced Nathan Timoney in the crew which medalled at the World Championships in 2023. The final World Cup regatta is in Poland in mid-June. The chance of competition may not have been pencilled in for most Ireland crews. It might look more attractive now.", "summary": "<p>The dominance of Ireland\u2019s Paul O\u2019Donovan and Fintan McCarthy has left many looking in from the outside presuming that the Olympic and world champions in the lightweight double sculls were somehow untouchable. Italy and Switzerland ripped that mantle away at the World Cup in Switzerland, pushing Ireland into the bronze medal position.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/other-sports/paul-odonovan-and-fintan-mccarthy-finish-third-in-world-cup-lightweight-double-sculls/a211747163.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/3sbxI6JpwKQ_tEDLLSk6bCl6F_s=/0x0:3238x2158/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/3112cca3-da12-4144-aba7-0b0aa250145a/c703c0be-0b1b-4397-8ffd-dfb3249ed7e3/Fintan%20MCarthy%20171.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:49:00", "author": "Liam Gorman", "authors": ["Liam Gorman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.02}

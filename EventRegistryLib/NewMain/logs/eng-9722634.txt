Sam McCann on Tuesday was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison for stealing nearly $700,000 in campaign funds and attempting to conceal his theft with false reports to state election authorities.\n\nIn February, McCann pleaded guilty to seven counts of wire fraud and one count each of money laundering and tax evasion - but only after prosecutors had spent nearly three days presenting evidence against him at trial.\n\nRead more: In last-minute reversal, former Sen. Sam McCann pleads guilty to corruption charges\n\nU.S. District Judge Colleen Lawless hearkened back to that moment as she was handing down her sentence Tuesday afternoon, saying McCann's refusal to \"accept responsibility\" until the last possible moment factored into her calculation for prison time. She also told McCann she was bothered that he \"continued to steal\" all while \"holding yourself out (to be) a God-fearing public servant.\"\n\n\"That may have been part of your stump speech and your public persona,\" Lawless said. \"But just because you said it over and over does not make it true.\"\n\nMcCann appeared in Lawless' courtroom clad in the gray-and-black striped uniform of the Macon County Jail, where he's been held since shortly before his trial began in February. The judge had ordered him detained when he disobeyed her directives after his sudden unexplained hospitalization on the eve of trial further delayed court proceedings, and she declined to release him on home confinement after his guilty plea to await sentencing.\n\nRead more: Former lawmaker taken into custody amid delays to his corruption trial after sudden hospitalization; Judge denies McCann's request for home confinement, orders him held in custody\n\nBut in addressing Lawless on Tuesday, McCann said he was \"thankful\" for his time in jail because of the relationships he was developing with other detainees and correctional officers. He also said he was coming to understand how some of the votes he took during his eight years in the General Assembly translated to real-world policy that contributed to his fellow detainees' involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\n\"I'd trust these men more than some of my colleagues in Illinois government,\" McCann said of his fellow detainees.\n\nMcCann was elected to the Illinois Senate in 2010, and then twice more in 2012 and 2016. During his eight years in office, McCann represented a rural district spanning from Springfield westward to the Missouri border, sometimes breaking from his own party to vote in the interest of organized labor - a key constituency for Democrats.\n\nMcCann's disagreements with GOP leadership ultimately led to him leaving the Republican Party and forming his own \"Conservative Party.\" In 2018, McCann ran on his new third-party ticket for governor, garnering $3 million from the International Union of Operating Engineers - a funding move seen as a strategic way to draw votes away from then GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner, who was deeply unpopular with organized labor.\n\nThough prosecutors alleged McCann's illegal campaign spending dated back to 2015, it ramped up in 2018, coinciding with McCann's run for governor and accompanying infusion of cash.\n\nThe government's evidence included checks and bank statements showing McCann used campaign money to pay two mortgages and delinquent loans in addition to helping finance multiple vehicles and vacations. McCann also fraudulently cut himself checks for work not performed and double-dipped on reimbursement for miles driven.\n\nRead more: Feds accuse ex-lawmaker of 'greed, fraud and arrogance' in misusing campaign funds\n\nDuring the summer of 2018, federal agents approached McCann about his campaign spending, but he denied any wrongdoing. In several hours of FBI recordings of the meetings played during trial, McCann stumbled over his explanations about why his campaign was paying to lease RVs and properties McCann personally owned, while the agents warned him that lying to them could land him in hot water.\n\nEven so, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Bass reminded Judge Lawless on Tuesday, McCann kept spending the campaign money all the way up through mid-2020, including buying another RV and cutting himself regular checks from the basically defunct Conservative Party of Illinois long after losing his bid for governor.\n\nBass said the continuation of illegal campaign fund spending even after multiple interviews with federal agents was McCann's \"most brazen\" act of \"fraud.\"\n\n\"This wasn't a one-off. This wasn't an anomaly,\" Bass said. \"He continued to use campaign funds for his personal expenses up to the point where there was nothing left.\"\n\nMcCann was indicted in early 2021, two years after he left public office after his failed third-party run for governor. He spent the next three years after charges were filed against him maintaining his innocence, refusing multiple plea agreements and eventually electing to represent himself at trial after burning through multiple court-appointed attorneys. Ultimately, however, McCann accepted legal representation after his sudden hospitalization on the eve of his already-delayed trial in February.\n\nOn Tuesday, attorney Jason Vincent asked Lawless for 12 months in prison - way below the sentencing guidelines that suggested an imprisonment of between 37 and 46 months. Bass had asked Lawless to give McCann the maximum 46 months.\n\nVincent argued that McCann had already \"been disgraced through his own actions\" and pointed to the number of pre-sentencing letters of support he'd received from McCann's family, friends and even former constituents.\n\nWhile Lawless said the show of support from McCann's family was encouraging, the judge said she ultimately viewed his actions in the larger context of other public corruption cases.\n\n\"Greed coupled with the abuse of power has become expected of public servants,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to his prison sentence, McCann was also ordered to pay $683,816.61 in restitution, which will be split between Local 150 and the Illinois Education Association, which gave to McCann for his campaigns prior to 2018.", "source": {"uri": "wglt.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "wglt.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_McCann", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label":

(AP) -- A former Illinois state senator and candidate for governor was sentenced Wednesday in federal court to 3 1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty to fraudulent use of campaign funds, money laundering and tax evasion.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Colleen Lawless, who also ordered William \"Sam\" McCann to pay $684,000 in restitution, noted during sentencing that McCann continued to siphon campaign money for personal use even after federal authorities confronted him. And she said he fraudulently claimed that he was physically and mentally unable to stand trial during a bizarre series of delays leading up to his February bench trial.\n\nMcCann, 54, who declared \"God's got this\" after firing his attorneys in 2023 and announcing that he would represent himself, later capitulated and started trial with new representation before throwing in the towel on the third day of testimony. He entered a no-strings open guilty plea to seven counts of wire fraud and one count each of money laundering and tax evasion. He faced up to 20 years in prison for each count of fraud and money laundering alone.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA state senator from 2011 to 2019, McCann formed the Conservative Party of Illinois in a 2018 bid for governor. His candidacy drew $3 million in contributions from a labor union which considered him a worker-friendly \"lunch-pail Republican.\"\n\nBut even after sitting through four FBI interviews in the summer of 2018, in which he acknowledged misspending, he burned through another $340,000 in campaign funds for personal use during the following year.\n\nMcCann last lived in Plainview, 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of St. Louis.\n\nTrial testimony indicated McCann tapped campaign cash to buy two pickups titled in his name and used personally. He bought a recreational vehicle and trailer which he listed with an Ohio business for online rental by Sam McCann, then used campaign money to rent them from himself under the name William McCann. He did not report the income on his federal tax return, nor did he report a $10,000 refunded campaign check which he deposited into a personal account.\n\nCampaign finances paid off a personal loan, made installments on two separate personal mortgages, and were used for more than $100,000 in credit card payments, a Colorado family vacation, store and online purchases and cash withdrawals. After his gubernatorial candidacy ended, he used a payroll service to disguise $187,000 in Conservative Party contributions he paid to himself and another $52,000 for payroll taxes.", "source":

In sentencing McCann, U.S. District Judge Colleen Lawless stated that McCann betrayed the public trust and continued his fraud even after being questioned by his campaign employee and confronted by federal law enforcement officers. In addition, Judge Lawless found it aggravating that McCann attempted to commit a fraud on the court by falsely representing that he was physically and mentally incapable of proceeding to trial.\n\nMcCann, of Plainview, Illinois, served as a state senator for the 49 District of Illinois from 2011 to 2013, and for the redrawn 50 District from 2013 to January 2019. McCann formed the Conservative Party of Illinois and, in 2018, launched an unsuccessful bid for Illinois Governor. McCann previously lived in Carlinville, Illinois, and owned and operated two construction-related businesses.\n\nMcCann organized multiple political committees that were registered with the Illinois State Board of Elections: Sam McCann for Senate; Sam McCann for Senate Committee; McCann for Illinois; and Conservative Party of Illinois. From April 2011 to November 2018, McCann and his political committees received more than $5 million in campaign donations.\n\nThe evidence presented during the bench trial and sentencing hearing established that McCann used campaign funds to purchase personal vehicles, pay personal debts, make mortgage payments, and pay himself, including the following:\n\nMcCann established an online account with a recreational vehicle rental business in Ohio and listed the vehicles for rent identifying Sam McCann as the owner. McCann then established a second account with the same rental business and identified himself as William McCann, a potential renter, with a different residential address and email than those he listed as the owner. From approximately May 2018 to June 2018, McCann, while representing himself as the renter, William, rented both the travel trailer and motor home from Sam, the owner, through the RV rental business. McCann caused a total of approximately $62,666 in campaign funds be used to pay the rental cost of the vehicles. The rental business retained approximately $9,838 for commission and paid McCann, as the owner, approximately $52,827 by direct deposit to McCann's personal checking account. McCann reimbursed the campaign accounts $18,000, resulting in more than $77,000 in campaign funds used to buy and rent from himself.\n\nDuring the third day of his bench trial, McCann pleaded guilty to all nine counts of the indictment, which charged him with seven counts of wire fraud, one count of money laundering, and one count of tax evasion related to his alleged misuse of campaign money for personal expenses. Prior to the commencement of the trial, the court revoked McCann's pretrial release and ordered that he be detained.\n\nThe statutory penalty for each count of wire fraud (seven counts) and one count of money laundering is up to 20 years in prison. For tax evasion, the statutory penalty is up to five years in prison.\n\nFollowing the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Harris stated: \"As Judge Lawless explained in imposing sentence, McCann brazenly betrayed the public trust by engaging in a five-year scheme to defraud and converting more than $600,000 in campaign funds to his personal use. Today's sentence appropriately holds McCann accountable for his criminal conduct. I thank the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division for their tireless and professional work in this matter. This Office will continue to hold public officials accountable for violating the public trust by exploiting it for their own personal gain.\"\n\n\"This sentence is a reminder that no one is immune to obeying the law,\" said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Thomas F. Murdock. \"Mr. McCann took a number of steps to conceal his fraud from his donors, the Illinois public, and law enforcement. Now through the combined efforts of the U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI and IRS CI, he will be held accountable for his deception.\"\n\n\"Investigating public corruption is a top priority for the FBI because the crime tears at the fabric of our democracy's security,\" said Acting Special Agent in Charge Jermaine Deans. \"Elected officials are entrusted and expected to protect the interests of the people with integrity -- a moral value Sam McCann did not uphold. The FBI, together with our law enforcement partners, will continue to investigate public officials who abuse public trust and use their office to commit illegal acts.\"\n\nThe case investigation was conducted by the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation.

Sam McCann on Tuesday was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison for stealing nearly $700,000 in campaign funds and attempting to conceal his theft with false reports to state election authorities.\n\nIn February, McCann pleaded guilty to seven counts of wire fraud and one count each of money laundering and tax evasion -- but only after prosecutors had spent nearly three days presenting evidence against him at trial.\n\nU.S. District Judge Colleen Lawless hearkened back to that moment as she was handing down her sentence Tuesday afternoon, saying McCann's refusal to \"accept responsibility\" until the last possible moment factored into her calculation for prison time. She also told McCann she was bothered that he \"continued to steal\" all while \"holding yourself out (to be) a God-fearing public servant.\"\n\n\"That may have been part of your stump speech and your public persona,\" Lawless said. \"But just because you said it over and over does not make it true.\"\n\nMcCann appeared in Lawless' courtroom clad in the gray-and-black striped uniform of the Macon County Jail, where he's been held since shortly before his trial began in February. The judge had ordered him detained when he disobeyed her directives after his sudden unexplained hospitalization on the eve of trial further delayed court proceedings, and she declined to release him on home confinement after his guilty plea to await sentencing.\n\nBut in addressing Lawless on Tuesday, McCann said he was \"thankful\" for his time in jail because of the relationships he was developing with other detainees and correctional officers. He also said he was coming to understand how some of the votes he took during his eight years in the General Assembly translated to real-world policy that contributed to his fellow detainees' involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\n\"I'd trust these men more than some of my colleagues in Illinois government,\" McCann said of his fellow detainees.\n\nA 'brazen...fraud'\n\nMcCann was elected to the Illinois Senate in 2010, and then twice more in 2012 and 2016. During his eight years in office, McCann represented a rural district spanning from Springfield westward to the Missouri border, sometimes breaking from his own party to vote in the interest of organized labor -- a key constituency for Democrats.\n\nMcCann's disagreements with GOP leadership ultimately led to him leaving the Republican Party and forming his own \"Conservative Party.\" In 2018, McCann ran on his new third-party ticket for governor, garnering $3 million from the International Union of Operating Engineers -- a funding move seen as a strategic way to draw votes away from then GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner, who was deeply unpopular with organized labor.\n\nThough prosecutors alleged McCann's illegal campaign spending dated back to 2015, it ramped up in 2018, coinciding with McCann's run for governor and accompanying infusion of cash.\n\nThe government's evidence included checks and bank statements showing McCann used campaign money to pay two mortgages and delinquent loans in addition to helping finance multiple vehicles and vacations. McCann also fraudulently cut himself checks for work not performed and double-dipped on reimbursement for miles driven.\n\nDuring the summer of 2018, federal agents approached McCann about his campaign spending, but he denied any wrongdoing. In several hours of FBI recordings of the meetings played during trial, McCann stumbled over his explanations about why his campaign was paying to lease RVs and properties McCann personally owned, while the agents warned him that lying to them could land him in hot water.\n\nEven so, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Bass reminded Judge Lawless on Tuesday, McCann kept spending the campaign money all the way up through mid-2020, including buying another RV and cutting himself regular checks from the basically defunct Conservative Party of Illinois long after losing his bid for governor.\n\nBass said the continuation of illegal campaign fund spending even after multiple interviews with federal agents was McCann's \"most brazen\" act of \"fraud.\"\n\n\"This wasn't a one-off. This wasn't an anomaly,\" Bass said. \"He continued to use campaign funds for his personal expenses up to the point where there was nothing left.\"\n\nMcCann was indicted in early 2021, two years after he left public office after his failed third-party run for governor. He spent the next three years after charges were filed against him maintaining his innocence, refusing multiple plea agreements and eventually electing to represent himself at trial after burning through multiple court-appointed attorneys. Ultimately, however, McCann accepted legal representation after his sudden hospitalization on the eve of his already-delayed trial in February.\n\nOn Tuesday, attorney Jason Vincent asked Lawless for 12 months in prison -- way below the sentencing guidelines that suggested an imprisonment of between 37 and 46 months. Bass had asked Lawless to give McCann the maximum 46 months.\n\nVincent argued that McCann had already \"been disgraced through his own actions\" and pointed to the number of pre-sentencing letters of support he'd received from McCann's family, friends and even former constituents.\n\nWhile Lawless said the show of support from McCann's family was encouraging, the judge said she ultimately viewed his actions in the larger context of other public corruption cases.\n\n\"Greed coupled with the abuse of power has become expected of public servants,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to his prison sentence, McCann was also ordered to pay $683,816.61 in restitution, which will be split between Local 150 and the Illinois Education Association, which gave to McCann for his campaigns prior to 2018.", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Lawless", "type": "person",

The restitution also comes with a forfeiture money judgment that allows federal authorities to seize any or all of McCann's property to make up the restitution in the case.\n\nMcCann previously served as an Illinois State Senator first in the 49th District, after defeating Deanna DeMuzio in 2010 and then later on in the 50th District prior to his run for governor in 2018.

Sam McCann was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison for stealing nearly $700,000 in campaign funds and attempting to conceal his theft with false reports to state election authorities.\n\nIn February, McCann pleaded guilty to seven counts of wire fraud and one count each of money laundering and tax evasion -- but only after prosecutors had spent nearly three days presenting evidence against him at trial.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She also told McCann she was bothered that he \"continued to steal\" all while \"holding yourself out (to be) a God-fearing public servant.\"\n\n\"That may have been part of your stump speech and your public persona,\" Lawless said. \"But just because you said it over and over does not make it true.\"\n\nMcCann appeared in Lawless' courtroom clad in the gray-and-black striped uniform of the Macon County Jail, where he's been held since shortly before his trial began in February. The judge had ordered him detained when he disobeyed her directives after his sudden unexplained hospitalization on the eve of trial further delayed court proceedings, and she declined to release him on home confinement after his guilty plea to await sentencing.\n\nBut in addressing Lawless on Tuesday, McCann said he was \"thankful\" for his time in jail because of the relationships he was developing with other detainees and correctional officers. He also said he was coming to understand how some of the votes he took during his eight years in the General Assembly translated to real-world policy that contributed to his fellow detainees' involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\n\"I'd trust these men more than some of my colleagues in Illinois government,\" McCann said of his fellow detainees.\n\nMcCann was elected to the Illinois Senate in 2010, and then twice more in 2012 and 2016. During his eight years in office, McCann represented a rural district spanning from Springfield westward to the Missouri border, sometimes breaking from his own party to vote in the interest of organized labor - a key constituency for Democrats.\n\nMcCann's disagreements with GOP leadership ultimately led to him leaving the Republican Party and forming his own \"Conservative Party.\" In 2018, McCann ran on his new third-party ticket for governor, garnering $3 million from the International Union of Operating Engineers - a funding move seen as a strategic way to draw votes away from then GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner, who was deeply unpopular with organized labor.\n\nThough prosecutors alleged McCann's illegal campaign spending dated back to 2015, it ramped up in 2018, coinciding with McCann's run for governor and accompanying infusion of cash.\n\nThe government's evidence included checks and bank statements showing McCann used campaign money to pay two mortgages and delinquent loans in addition to helping finance multiple vehicles and vacations. McCann also fraudulently cut himself checks for work not performed and double-dipped on reimbursement for miles driven.\n\nDuring the summer of 2018, federal agents approached McCann about his campaign spending, but he denied any wrongdoing. In several hours of FBI recordings of the meetings played during trial, McCann stumbled over his explanations about why his campaign was paying to lease RVs and properties McCann personally owned, while the agents warned him that lying to them could land him in hot water.\n\nEven so, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Bass reminded Judge Lawless on Tuesday, McCann kept spending the campaign money all the way up through mid-2020, including buying another RV and cutting himself regular checks from the basically defunct Conservative Party of Illinois long after losing his bid for governor.\n\nBass said the continuation of illegal campaign fund spending even after multiple interviews with federal agents was McCann's \"most brazen\" act of \"fraud.\"\n\n\"This wasn't a one-off. This wasn't an anomaly,\" Bass said. \"He continued to use campaign funds for his personal expenses up to the point where there was nothing left.\"\n\nMcCann was indicted in early 2021, two years after he left public office after his failed third-party run for governor. He spent the next three years after charges were filed against him maintaining his innocence, refusing multiple plea agreements and eventually electing to represent himself at trial after burning through multiple court-appointed attorneys. Ultimately, however, McCann accepted legal representation after his sudden hospitalization on the eve of his already-delayed trial in February.\n\nOn Tuesday, attorney Jason Vincent asked Lawless for 12 months in prison - way below the sentencing guidelines that suggested an imprisonment of between 37 and 46 months. Bass had asked Lawless to give McCann the maximum 46 months.\n\nVincent argued that McCann had already \"been disgraced through his own actions\" and pointed to the number of pre-sentencing letters of support he'd received from McCann's family, friends and even former constituents.\n\nWhile Lawless said the show of support from McCann's family was encouraging, the judge said she ultimately viewed his actions in the larger context of other public corruption cases.\n\n\"Greed coupled with the abuse of power has become expected of public servants,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to his prison sentence, McCann was also ordered to pay $683,816.61 in restitution, which will be split between Local 150 and the Illinois Education Association, which gave to McCann for his campaigns prior to 2018.\n\nCapitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered

In addition, he was instructed to make restitution in the amount of $683,816.61.\n\nIt has been discovered that federal investigators began looking into McCann's campaign expenses as early as February 2019. In December 2019, WCIA conducted an investigation into McCann's expenses and discovered a significant amount of undisclosed payroll expenses totaling $168,665.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson from the State Board of Elections, the expenses allocated to unidentified employees were deemed illegal at the time.\n\nIn 2021, McCann faced serious charges including wire fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion.\n\nIn court, prosecutors presented evidence that McCann allegedly misappropriated funds from multiple political committees, such as Sam McCann for Senate, McCann for Illinois, and the Conservative Party of Illinois. Some of the funds were used for personal expenses such as cars, mortgage payments, and credit card bills.\n\nREAD NEXT: Aviation Mechanic Fatally Sucked Into Boeing Jet Engine During Maintenance\n\nMcCann, 54, confidently declared \"God's got this\" when he decided to dismiss his attorneys in 2023 and take on the role of representing himself, according to AP News.\n\nHowever, he eventually changed his mind and began the trial with new legal representation. On the third day of testimony, McCann decided to give up and end the trial. He has recently admitted to seven counts of wire fraud, as well as one count each of money laundering and tax evasion, without any conditions or reservations.\n\nThe potential consequences for his actions were severe, with each count of fraud and money laundering carrying a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nMcCann served as a state senator from 2011 to 2019 and later established the Conservative Party of Illinois during his 2018 campaign for governor.

(WCIA) -- A former Illinois state legislator and candidate for governor was sentenced Wednesday after pleading guilty to wire fraud and other corruption-related charges.\n\nSam McCann, a Senate Republican for Central Illinois between 2011 to 2019 and a 2018 gubernatorial candidate for the Conservative Party, was sentenced to 3 1/2 years years in prison. After his prison time, McCann will face two years of supervised release. He was also ordered to pay $683,816.61 in restitution.\n\nFederal investigators were inquiring into McCann's campaign expenses as early as Feb. 2019. WGN sister station WCIA-TV investigated McCann's expenses in December 2019 and found $168,665 in secret payroll expenses. A spokesperson for the State Board of Elections described the expenses to undisclosed employees as illegal at the time.\n\nMcCann was indicted in 2021 with seven counts of wire fraud, one count of money laundering and one count of tax evasion.\n\nProsecutors in court argued McCann misused funds from several political committees, including Sam McCann for Senate, McCann for Illinois, and the Conservative Party of Illinois. He used some of those funds to pay for personal cars, mortgage payments, and personal credit card payments.\n\nMcCann pleaded guilty to all nine counts in February, and was denied pre-trial release until the sentencing hearing. He was held in the Macon County Jail.\n\n\"McCann brazenly betrayed the public trust by engaging in a five-year scheme to defraud and converting more than $600,000 in campaign funds to his personal use,\" U.S. Attorney for the Central District of Illinois Greg Harris said. \"Today's sentence appropriately holds McCann accountable for his criminal conduct. I thank the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division for their tireless and professional work in this matter.\"\n\nFederal law enforcement with both the IRS and the FBI said the sentence serves as a reminder that public officials will be help accountable for corruption.\n\n\"Elected officials are entrusted and expected to protect the interests of the people with integrity -- a moral value Sam McCann did not uphold,\" FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Jermaine Deans said. \"Investigating public corruption is a top priority for the FBI because the crime tears at the fabric of our democracy's security.\"", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And she said he fraudulently claimed that he was physically and mentally unable to stand trial during a bizarre series of delays leading up to his February bench trial.\n\nMcCann, 54, who declared \"God's got this\" after firing his attorneys in 2023 and announcing that he would represent himself, later capitulated and started trial with new representation before throwing in the towel on the third day of testimony. He entered a no-strings open guilty plea to seven counts of wire fraud and one count each of money laundering and tax evasion. He faced up to 20 years in prison for each count of fraud and money laundering alone.\n\nPi Pizzeria closing last remaining location, in St. Louis' Central West End McClellan: Downtown St. Louis is a casualty of the do-gooder war Tropical Storm Beryl could hit St. Louis area with 4 inches of rain or more Hulk Hogan starts selling his new Real American Beer in Missouri, competing with Bud Light Wentzville schools investigated board members for alleged retaliation, ethics violations BenFred: Why Jordan Walker's name will provide hot-stove fodder as Cardinals near trade deadline Parades, fireworks and parties: Your guide to July 4th in St. Louis Several St. Louis-area cities move fireworks shows to Friday.

His candidacy drew $3 million in contributions from a labor union which considered him a worker-friendly \"lunch-pail Republican.\"\n\nBut even after sitting through four FBI interviews in the summer of 2018, in which he acknowledged misspending, he burned through another $340,000 in campaign funds for personal use during the following year.\n\nMcCann last lived in Plainview, 50 miles northeast of St. Louis.\n\nTrial testimony indicated McCann tapped campaign cash to buy two pickups titled in his name and used personally. He bought a recreational vehicle and trailer which he listed with an Ohio business for online rental by Sam McCann, then used campaign money to rent them from himself under the name William McCann. He did not report the income on his federal tax return, nor did he report a $10,000 refunded campaign check which he deposited into a personal account.\n\nCampaign finances paid off a personal loan, made installments on two separate personal mortgages, and were used for more than $100,000 in credit card payments, a Colorado family vacation, store and online purchases and cash withdrawals. After his gubernatorial candidacy ended, he used a payroll service to disguise $187,000 in Conservative Party contributions he paid to himself and another $52,000 for payroll taxes.\n\n0 Comments",

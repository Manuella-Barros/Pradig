While spending and regulation comprise the federal government\u2019s primary operations, how those costs materialize at the household level remains murky and largely unmeasured. 2024. Benjamin Franklin looking calculator on One Hundred Dollar Bill. getty We see the big-picture spending numbers, of course; well over $6 trillion in annual outlays with no pandemic lingering to justify it, and a debt of $34 trillion. Congress doesn\u2019t merely hold the yearly purse strings; it turns that ragged bag upside down and, as the song goes, shakes it like a Polaroid picture. Then it snatches other purses to the tune of over $1.5 trillion in annual borrowed funds, with no end in sight according to the Congressional Budget Office. Disclosure is far worse for total costs of federal regulatory interventions; there, the public gets nothing from officialdom apart from unreliable regulatory impact analyses for individual rules, and irregular \u201cannual\u201d reports to Congress. What are the taxpayers and citizens on the hook for it all receiving? Getting a handle on the per-taxpayer and per-household portions of the debt and regulatory costs are basic asks in terms of public disclosure and accountability, yet seemingly out of reach. Until now, perhaps. Two steps forward on per-person debt liabilities: A significant move to advance spending transparency at the household and personal level is now afoot. Earlier this month, the House Budget Committee voted to advance to the full House the Debt Per Taxpayer Information Act (H.R. 8372), sponsored by Chairman and Texas Republican Jodey Arrington (R-TX).

Enactment of H.R. 8372 would also require the President\u2019s budget request and the concurrent budget resolution to include estimates of debt per taxpayer.\" Each party blames the other for the debt, and they\u2019re both right. GOP members noted during markup deliberations that, at $34 trillion, the national debt per taxpayer now exceeds $200,000, or $800,000 for a family of four. Despite the rancor in Washington, occasionally the two parties come to terms on transparency and disclosure in fiscal processes. The Debt Per Taxpayer Act stands out as a notable instance, advanced 21-4 to the full House. Agreement on transparency in regulatory matters is more elusive since there\u2019s little to no quantification as the macro level, but it does happen periodically as well. The Debt Per Taxpayer legislation recognizes that not everyone has the time or inclination to scrutinize the annual federal budget and perform a \u201cper capita\u201d calculation to determine how much debt \u201cbelongs\u201d to ourselves and our children. However, we all review our W-2 forms every year at tax time. April 15 marks the crucial moment for reckoning and confronting every taxpayer's personalized estimated \u201cobligation.\u201d Honesty and fairness require this transparency, making the concept of \u201cbang for the buck\u201d clear in more than just a metaphorical sense. Alongside the W2 reckoning, the Debt Per Taxpayer Information Act would mandate inclusion of pro-rata tax incidence information in the President's budget request and within the concurrent budget resolution deliberations in Congress, prioritizing the taxpayer perspective in those documents as well. In a statement of my own to the House Budget Committee emphasizing the importance of informed governance concerning both spending and regulatory matters, I highlighted that the Debt Per Taxpayer Information Act represents progress in constraining the federal government to its limited, constitutional bounds by clarifying to taxpayers the exact extent of their involvement. In that regard, perhaps the only potential enhancement to the measure would be the complete elimination of paycheck withholding. This would require every taxpayer to physically write a check or perform a digital transfer for their entire tax bill, making the size and scope of government unmistakably clear One step back; blurring the debt-per-taxpayer numbers: One unfortunate development during the markup would dilute the pure emphasis on the scale and scope of governmental costs to taxpayers if retained as the bill progresses through Congress. Democratic committee members fretted that the per-taxpayer liability figures do not include the purported benefits of government spending. Other Democratic members didn\u2019t like what they regarded as the implication that everyone pays the same share of the national debt, which is obviously not the case under progressive taxation. But nor does everyone uniformly benefit from federal outlays as they seemed to imply. \"We have concerns,\" intoned Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota). \"We believe that we shouldn't just show citizens one side of the budget ... that we should talk about the investments and services that they are also receiving.\u201d She protested that the original bill \"only examines federal liabilities but does not really consider the asset side of the balance sheet or the long term benefits from spending.\u201d Unfortunately, such \u201cinvestments\u201d terminology permeates public policy with respect to federal outlays and the lengths to which some will go to avoid acknowledging fiscal and regulatory costs are remarkable. The GOP is itself culpable in abetting this transformation with endorsement of the likes of the CHIPS and Science Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. These and other big-spending legislation like them drip with market socialism and the notion that government spending constitutes investments rather than transfers and accompanying deadweight losses. Therefore brazenly, Omar was able to assert without pushback that \"public spending can yield more for the economy and greater society than if that money had been solely allocated in the private sector.\" Omar invoked fiscal year 2023 \"investments\" of $536 billion on grants to state and local governments as well as on various research and development, education and training initiatives. She presented these as benefits, despite the fact that they are prime examples of today's fiscal deterioration that has induced the call for per-taxpayer transparency in the first place. A similar version of utilitarianism and pretended offset of costs with benefits exists on the regulatory side to be noted shortly. The bottom line is that Rep. Omar\u2019s protest against clean-slate presentation of debt per taxpayer resulted in a successful amendment requiring more information on \"federal total financial assets, net liabilities and federal investments.\" If one were to imagine this would mean the Democrats are open to, for example, selling off federal lands and conducting other privatizations to reimburse taxpayers, one would surely be in for a surprise. If anything, subsidies, grants, loan guarantees, grants-in-aid to states and like escapades are widely exploited for political purposes. They merit drastic retrenchment, likely via constitutional amendment, not fresh legitimization pretending they offset individual Americans\u2019 debt burdens. We already hear rationales for stratospheric outlays from the entire federal government. What we need is a clear emphasis on the cost side, reflected on the W-2. Future adjustments to the Debt Per Taxpayer Act should ensure this transparency. No matter where those costs and benefits fall, Peter pays and Paul receives. Peter deserves, for once, to know the score without smoke and mirrors and without being presented with the illusion that he always comes out a winner. Federal regulatory costs as a hidden tax on the household: Atop federal spending generating that debt load of $200,000 per taxpayer, Congress and agencies prod extensively in the form of economic and social regulation. While income taxes get itemized on pay stubs and merit the annual household reckoning discussed above, nothing similar to latch on to exists for the hidden tax of economic, environmental, labor, medical, social, paperwork and other regulatory costs embedded in prices of goods and services that we buy. Regulations can affect households directly, or indirectly such as when businesses pass compliance costs on to consumers, just as they do the corporate income tax. Regulations can also directly and indirectly impact households in their capacities as workers and as investors in stock and mutual fund holdings of companies subject to various regulations. Costs of regulation percolating throughout the economy, for which I maintain a current placeholder of just over $2 trillion annually based on various legacy government reports and other sources, happens to be on par with today\u2019s annual deficit. Unlike the specificity of the debt and its relative ease of translation to the income tax paying household, the true incidence of individual regulatory costs is indeterminate since no one knows what the aggregate costs of regulation and intervention are. They surpass the $2 trillion employed here. But for present purposes, by assuming a full pass-through to households of the $2 trillion placeholder regulatory costs, one can look at those households\u2019 share of regulatory costs and compare it with their annual expenditures on key necessities, goods and services using figures compiled by the Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics. For America\u2019s 134.1 million households (BLS calls them \u201cconsumer units\u201d), the average 2022 pretax income was $94,003. Were one to allocate annual regulatory costs assuming the full pass-through of costs to consumers, U.S. households \u201cpay\u201d $15,788 annually in embedded costs ($2.1 trillion in regulation divided by 134,090,000 consumer units), or 17 percent of average income before taxes (and of course more as a share of after-tax income). That\u2019s somewhat of a lowball figure. A late 2023 study by the National Association of Manufacturers reckons regulatory costs of $3.079 trillion, which would imply costs of $22,962 per household, or 24 percent of income. Using the $2.1 trillion baseline, the buried regulatory \u201ctax\u201d of $15,788 amounts to up to 22 percent of the typical household\u2019s expenditure budget of $72,967. That exceeds every annual household expenditure item except housing, as shown in the chart here: US Household Expense Budget items Compared to Cost of Regulation Compilations by CWCJr. from Bureau of Labor Statistics The average U.S. household spends far more on regulation, therefore, than on either health care, food, transportation, entertainment, apparel, services, or savings. For comparison, he NAM\u2019s $3.079 trillion regulatory $22,962 amounts to 31 percent of household expenditures. That still does not exceed housing costs but comes uncomfortably close. Tying it all together: The tax costs and regulatory costs covered above are the makings of necessary markers to give policymakers a better sense of the scale and scope of Washington\u2019s initiatives and their true effects at the household level. The $800,000 in debt per family of four is a lump-sum figure. The $16,000 in regulatory costs is an annual embedded burden. Lawmakers should improve official disclosures of both. The Debt Per Taxpayer Information Act represents the elemental transparency often talked about but not always actualized. If enacted into law, it promises to foster an informed citizenry and strengthen the democratic process by enabling taxpayers to hold elected officials accountable for fiscal stewardship in a brand new way. That done, the next step is for Congress to provide the same level of disclosure for the hidden taxes of federal rules and regulations in terms of compliance costs and wide ranging indirect effects. Whether or not the man really said it, \u201cMeasure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so.\u201d Follow me on Twitter. Check out my website.

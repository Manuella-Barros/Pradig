{"id": 231326674, "title": "The inside story of Rishi's D-Day disaster and how his No.10 team have been blaming each other for...", "text": "It was the moment that D-Day turned into Dunkirk for Rishi Sunak. At the early morning meeting held by the Prime Minister\u2019s election strategists on Thursday, the fact that he would be missing the ceremony with Presidents Biden and Macron is said to have been dismissed by one of Sunak\u2019s longest-serving aides. \u2018It\u2019s not important. It\u2019s just a chance to pose together,\u2019 they are claimed to have said. Within 24 hours, Sunak had beat a humiliating retreat by issuing an apology for returning from France early to record a TV interview. But while many critics have singled out \u2018those around\u2019 Sunak for the misstep, others point the finger directly at the Prime Minister. One said: \u2018Can you imagine Boris being told he should leave early to do a TV interview? He would just say: \u2018Sod off, I\u2019m staying.\u2019 \u2018Even if it was advisers saying he didn\u2019t need to stay, he as the principal could have ignored them,\u2019 another source said. \u2018Spads advise. Prime Ministers decide.\u2019 It was nearly even worse; the original plan was for Defence Secretary Grant Shapps to go in Sunak\u2019s place - until aides realised how odd it will have looked to have him standing next to world leaders. So Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron was sent in at the last minute, on the grounds that at least Cameron had led his country at one stage. Fatefully, they did not realise it was a job for Sunak. The decision to send Cameron is indicative for a Prime Minister accused of \u2018not giving a toss about defence and foreign affairs\u2019, a source familiar with the conversations said. \u2018The one time they can counter that perception, they fail so spectacularly. It\u2019s astonishing.\u2019 The D-Day fiasco has widened the schisms in the Tory party which run from No.10 down to the party grassroots. The aftermath of D-Day saw briefings singling out two female aides to Sunak, which have piled pressure on an already strained working environment in Number 10. \u2018A lot of tension has been bubbling for months between the political and the press sides,\u2019 an insider said, raising concerns that the \u2018boys\u2019 \u2013 allies of Sunak including his chief-of-staff Liam Booth Smith and political secretary James Forsyth \u2013 have been blaming female staff for campaign errors. Counter-briefings then followed, with sources saying Forsyth had been liaising with the Cabinet Office Major Events Unit about the D-Day itinerary, and was in several meetings where Sunak\u2019s attendance was described as \u2018optional\u2019. Concerns were raised that, with Sunak due to fly to Italy for the G7 this week, the PM\u2019s diary was too full of government duties. It was also initially thought Sir Keir Starmer would not attend the International leader\u2019s D -Day event. \u2018It\u2019s all just a shambles,\u2019 an insider said of the Number 10 operation. To add to the tensions, insiders say the French have been stoking the D-Day row - including the heavily denied claim that Sunak nearly boycotted the event entirely. The insiders claim this was pay-back for briefings about President Macron deliberately missing the leaders\u2019 bus at the Queen\u2019s funeral so that he could ride in a limo instead. Cabinet ministers complain they are being kept out of the loop by the inner circle, with only Oliver Dowden believed to have the Prime Minister\u2019s ear. Even senior ministers say they have been told what will be in the manifesto for their departments, after it is all decided by Downing Street, and not consulted in the process. One minister said the D Day decision was \u2018catastrophic\u2019 and that the way people closest to Sunak are being parachuted into safe Tory seats has only poured gasoline onto the fire. Tories are furious that Will Tanner, Sunak\u2019s deputy chief of staff who has been running the manifesto process, has spent the days before its crucial launch campaigning in Bury St Edmunds & Stowmarket. He is one of a list of Sunak allies and aides who have been parachuted into safe seats \u2013 mostly using the rules that allowed the party to present Conservative associations with one-person or three-person shortlists as Friday\u2019s deadline for selections approached. \u2018We\u2019ve seen that all over the country. It is very, very undemocratic. Good local candidates have been blocked from being considered, and the centre has presented associations with their crony candidate alongside two weak candidate. \u2018It\u2019s a stitch up - and it\u2019s demoralising to candidates, demoralising to members.\u2019 Last night a senior Tory on the right of the party called for a \u2018reckoning\u2019 after the election. \u2018Whoever is the next leader should de-select these tossers. \u2018They are responsible for tanking the party \u2013 and all they care about is getting their own safe seats.\u2019 The source said there needs to be a \u2018clear-out\u2019 of the party while another Tory candidate said that, if after the election the Sunak centrists take over, he will quit it altogether. Multiple candidates pointed the blame on Forsyth, Sunak\u2019s old school friend. \u2018His fingerprints are all over this. He has probably never knocked on a door in his entire life, he has no understanding of the Conservative Party \u2013 he\u2019s just sitting in a dark room, carving up all these safe seats for his mates.\u2019 And party chairman Richard Holden is facing calls to quit after claims of a \u2018stitch up\u2019 over how he was awarded a safe seat of Basildon and Billericay. \u2018I\u2019ve never witnessed so much opprobrium and hatred towards a Cabinet minister,\u2019 a Tory elected alongside Holden in 2019 said. \u2018He is a man devoid of morals. We are determined to get rid of him.\u2019 Holden has denied the claims. \u2018I hope Reform wins in Basildon and Billericay,\u2019 one long-term Tory activist told the MoS. Others blame Sunak\u2019s leadership style. A source said: \u2018He runs his diary like a CEO, When I have had meetings with him, it\u2019s two minutes here, five minutes there. Everything is back to back. It is like he is running a big business \u2013 without the flexibility that you normally require in politics.\u2019 The criticism is echoed by Conservative donors. Last week a donor who has been giving \u2018\u00a325,000 a year for ages\u2019 to the party switched to funding Reform. With four weeks left to go before polling day, Tory candidates are trying to make the best out of a grim set of cards. After the D-Day debacle several Tory Red Wallers have told CCHQ to cancel deliveries of leaflets because they have the Prime Minister\u2019s picture on them. One told the MoS: \u2018I am running a hyper-local campaign. \u2018I haven\u2019t got Rishi in any of my leaflets. I haven\u2019t even got the word Conservatives. I\u2019m hoping to get a written endorsement from Boris.\u2019 Sunak loyalists hope the row will \u2018blow over\u2019. But a senior Tory adviser said the D-Day gaffe has cut through: \u2018All our candidates are reporting it coming back on the doorsteps. The day after the election people will still be talking about it.\u2019", "summary": "It was the moment that D-Day turned into Dunkirk for Rishi Sunak.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13508887/The-inside-story-Rishis-D-Day-disaster-No-10-team-blaming-shambles.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/15/85875301-0-image-m-17_1717857392867.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:10:33", "author": "Anna Mikhailova,Editor", "authors": ["Anna Mikhailova", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.295}

The Fianna Fail councillor may well be followed in second place by his uncle, independent councillor Eugene McGuinness, who looks like improving on his vote which saw him elected in 2019 for the first time. Fine Gael's David Fitzgerald will be a strong contender for third place, and followed by Fianna Fail's Joe Malone. It will likely be after quite a few counts, but Fianna Fail's John Coonan will be hopeful that transfers will carry him over to the fifth seat. The final two seats will then be a slugfest, with several contenders: Sean O'hArgain (Labour) looks well placed. Maria Dollard (Green Party) has a fight on her hands, but may get transfers. A Sinn Fein candidate is also a strong possibility, while Fine Gael councillor Martin Brett, who claimed the last seat in 2019, will be under pressure to hold on to it. Again - this is all provisional and based on tally figures. Outside of Eugene McGuinness, it's looking like a tough day at the office for the independents and many of the newcomers in Kilkenny City.

Later that afternoon, the company published the following statement:\n\n\"We sincerely thank Jack for his help funding and initiating that Bluesky project. Bluesky is thriving as an open source social network running on atproto, the decentralized protocol we have built.\n\nWith Jack's departure, we are searching for a new board member for the Bluesky public benefit company who shares our commitment to building a social network that puts people in control of their experience. More to come!\"\n\nDorsey first announced Bluesky in 2019, back when he was still CEO of Twitter. He wrote that Twitter (now X) was \"funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media.\"\n\nThe Verge reported that Twitter founder Jack Dorsey is no longer on the board of Bluesky, the decentralized social media platform he helped start.\n\nNeither Bluesky nor Dorsey himself seem to have said how or what he left the board. For now, two board members remain: CEO, Jay Graeber, and Jabber / XMPP inventor Jeremie Miller. Dorsey originally backed Bluesky in 2019 as a project to develop an open-source social media standard that he wanted Twitter to move to. He later joined its board of directors when it split from Twitter in 2022.\n\nBut Dorsey hadn't seemingly been a particularly active participant at the company. In March, when The Verge's Nilay Patel asked Graeber for Decoder, about his level of involvement with Bluesky, she said she gets \"some feedback occasionally,\" but implied he's otherwise \"being Jack Dorsey on a cloud,\" as Nilay put it. Months after that interview, Dorsey had closed his Bluesky account.\n\nEngadget reported Jack Dorsey has apparently exited the Bluesky board. The former Twitter CEO who was previously Bluesky's highest-profile proponent shared the life update this weekend on X, where he's been posting a lot lately.\n\nThe decentralized social network started as a project by a team at then-Twitter back in 2019, but it eventually split off on its own. It only opened to the public this March after being invite-only for almost year.\n\nDorsey has said mixed things about X since Elon Musk's takeover, but it seems he's now swung back around. On Saturday, he posted on X \"don't depend on corporations to grant you rights. Defend them yourself using freedom technology (you're on one).\"\n\nIn my opinion, Jack Dorsey appears to be someone who puts a lot of himself into a social media site, and then leaves it in favor of the next big thing.", "source": {"uri": "geeknewscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Geek News Central"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bluesky Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Dorsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communication protocol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "XMPP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bluesky-butterfly-logo-large.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541403", "eventUri": "eng-9541403", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 240, "relevance": 1}

The confirmation came through Bluesky's posts, where the company expressed gratitude towards Dorsey and revealed their ongoing search for a new board member who aligns with their vision of empowering users to control their social media interactions.\n\nBluesky's official handle wrote on the platform, \"We sincerely thank Jack for his help funding and initiating the Bluesky project. Today, Bluesky is thriving as an open-source social network running on atproto [AT Protocol], the decentralised protocol we have built,\" posted the Bluesky team on its platform on Monday.\" It added, \"With Jack's departure, we are searching for a new board member for the Bluesky public benefit company who shares our commitment to building a social network that puts people in control of their experience.

Dorsey replied \"no,\" without providing further details. His response coincided with a noticeable activity on X, where he unfollowed nearly all accounts except for three, amidst referring to the platform as \"freedom technology.\"\n\nThe reasons behind Dorsey's departure from the board remain unclear as neither he nor Bluesky have elaborated on the circumstances leading to this decision. Presently, the board consists of two remaining members: CEO Jay Graeber and Jeremie Miller, the inventor of Jabber / XMPP. Dorsey had been a key supporter of Bluesky since its inception in 2019, promoting it as a project aimed at creating an open-source social media standard. He officially joined the board when Bluesky became independent of Twitter in 2022.\n\nDespite his foundational role, Dorsey's participation in the operational aspects of Bluesky appeared minimal. In a March interview with The Verge's Nilay Patel, Graeber mentioned that while she received \"some feedback occasionally\" from Dorsey, his involvement was not deeply engaged, leading Patel to describe Dorsey as \"being Jack Dorsey on a cloud.\" This was further evidenced by Dorsey's decision to close his Bluesky account several months prior to the interview.\n\nFor the unversed, Dorsey stepped down from the Twitter board in May 2022, months before the social media company was acquired by Elon Musk. Furthermore, Dorsey had resigned as the Twitter CEO in November 2021. Although he had not revealed the exact reason behind leaving the company, it was reported that the Twitter board was trying to replace him, citing his lack of innovation and divided attention.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bluesky Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Dorsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communication protocol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "XMPP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/jack-dorsey-06243945-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=R6Oos7hI0S0AHUBEgJWCveWcHCvjxxRD", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541403", "eventUri": "eng-9541403", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

His departure marks a significant development for Bluesky, as Dorsey was one of its most prominent supporters.\n\nOver the weekend, Bluesky witnessed a noteworthy change as Jack Dorsey, a prominent advocate, stepped down from its board. Dorsey, known for backing the platform, used his philanthropic endeavor to provide updates on grants for open protocols via X.\n\nThis prompted inquiries about his position on the Bluesky board, to which Dorsey responded, \"No.\" Despite further queries seeking clarification, Dorsey did not provide additional details about his departure.\n\nIt seems that Dorsey quietly removed his Bluesky account sometime last year, which garnered minimal attention at the time and was only acknowledged through sporadic social media posts. He also deactivated his Instagram account.\n\nNonetheless, his presence remained synonymous with the project, signifying his significant involvement in its development. Dorsey has been notably active on X this weekend, sharing corporate updates and delving into various topics, such as the ongoing feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nMoreover, he made a notable gesture by unfollowing nearly all other accounts on the platform. He shared a message emphasizing the importance of defending rights through the use of freedom technology.\n\nThe timing of Dorsey's departure from the board remains uncertain. As of Sunday morning, Bluesky's corporate FAQ continued to list him as a board member. However, later that afternoon, the company issued a statement expressing gratitude to Jack for his contributions to funding and initiating the Bluesky project.\n\nTechCrunch reported that Bluesky highlighted its current success as an open-source social network operating on Atproto, the decentralized protocol it has developed.\n\nFollowing Jack's exit, Bluesky is actively seeking a new board member for its public benefit company, emphasizing the importance of finding someone who shares their vision of empowering users to control their social network experience.\n\nAlso read: Is Jack Dorsey's Bluesky Social the New Twitter?

At the time, he outlined Twitter's support for a small team of open-source architects, engineers, and designers to pioneer an open and decentralized social media standard.\n\nOver time, Bluesky has evolved into an autonomous public benefit corporation, now helmed by CEO Jay Graber and bolstered by venture capital support.

In another post on X, Dorsey described Elon Musk's platform as \"freedom technology.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, Jack Dorsey was a key player in making Bluesky known. The project was born in 2019 with the support of Twitter. The main goal was to offer a decentralized, open-source social platform. Later (2022), Bluesky became \"independent\" through venture capital support, opening to the mass public without waiting lists in February of this year.\n\nIt's noteworthy that Jack Dorsey deleted his Bluesky account last year. However, it wasn't the only one, since his Instagram account also went down. Even so, he remained the most important face related to the project.

He also just poured millions of dollars into a competing project. It isn't clear exactly why he left or when, but it doesn't look entirely drama-free from the outside.\n\nDorsey made his departure from Bluesky public on Saturday via a post on his Twitter/X account. Replying to a query about whether he was still on the Twitter/X competitor's board, Dorsey responded with a blunt \"no,\" offering no further elaboration. Bluesky confirmed Dorsey's exit on its own platform later that day.\n\nThe official Bluesky account wrote, \"We sincerely thank Jack for his help funding and initiating the bluesky project.\"\n\nBluesky further announced that it is currently searching for a new board member to replace Dorsey, stating that it's after someone \"who shares our commitment to building a social network that puts people in control of their experience.\"\n\nMashable has reached out to Bluesky for comment.\n\nThough neither Dorsey nor Bluesky seems inclined to get into details of his departure, the former's social media movements certainly paint an interesting picture. Dorsey appears to have deleted his personal Bluesky account last September yet continues to use Nostr, another decentralised social media network protocol.\n\nIn fact, questions regarding Dorsey's status with Bluesky initially arose in response to an announcement that his philanthropic fund #startsmall donated $5 million to support Nostr's development. This was part of a larger $21 million donation to OpenStats, a charity that funds open-source projects that relate to Bitcoin.\n\nDorsey is also still active on Twitter/X, despite having left the company much less recently than he did Bluesky. Dorsey stepped down from Twitter/X's board of directors two years ago in May 2022, just a few months before the social media platform was acquired by billionaire Elon Musk. This departure completed a planned exit which began when Dorsey relinquished the title of CEO in November 2021.\n\nHowever, Dorsey did go on an unfollowing spree this weekend, reducing his following list on Twitter/X from over 2000 people to just Musk, Edward Snowden, and Stella Assange.\n\n\"don't depend on corporations to grant you rights,\" Dorsey posted to Twitter/X hours after revealing his exit from its competitor. \"defend them yourself using freedom technology.

Dorsey first announced the Bluesky project on Twitter in 2019, calling it \"an open and decentralized standard for social media.\" Originally launching as an invite-only social media platform, Bluesky became open to anyone this year, and now appears to have roughly four million users signed up. Dorsey's departure does not seem to be a good sign for the up-and-coming platform.\n\nDorsey had an active weekend on his old platform, X. The Twitter founder unfollowed more than 2,000 accounts, and now is only following Elon Musk, Edward Snowden, and Stella Assange. Meanwhile, he chimed in on Kendrick and Drake's rap beef quite a bit. He also seemed to call X a \"freedom technology\" in a tweet on Saturday, warning users to not depend on corporations to grant them rights.\n\nNBC News reported last week that federal prosecutors are examining the financial transactions of another Jack Dorsey company, Block. New York prosecutors are examining documents that reportedly show \"yearslong compliance lapses\" at Block, related to economically sanctioned countries and processing crypto transactions from terrorist groups. Block told NBC it has an \"extensive compliance program.\"\n\nBluesky and Block did not immediately respond to Gizmodo's request for comment.\n\nDorsey stepped down from Twitter's board in 2022, marking his departure from the ultra-popular social media company he founded.

Bluesky only recently opened to the public in March 2023 after a year-long invite-only period.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, Bluesky thanked Dorsey for his help in funding and initiating the project, acknowledging that the platform is now thriving on its decentralized protocol, atproto. The company also announced its search for a new board member who shares their commitment to building a user-centric social network.\n\nDorsey's involvement with Bluesky had been somewhat limited, with CEO Jay Graber previously stating that he provided occasional feedback but was otherwise \"being Jack Dorsey on a cloud.\" Months before this revelation, Dorsey had already closed his Bluesky account.\n\nThe former Twitter CEO's departure from the Bluesky board coincides with his renewed focus on what he calls \"freedom technology.\" In a series of posts on X, Dorsey unfollowed all but three accounts and urged users not to depend on corporations for their rights, stating, \"defend them yourself using freedom technology.

He was one of the three board members at Bluesky. The company recently confirmed that Mr. Dorsey has exited the Bluesky board. \"With Jack's departure, we are searching for a new board member for the Bluesky public benefit company who shares our commitment to building a social network that puts people in control of their experience,\" Bluesky said in a social media post on May 6.\n\n\"We sincerely thank Jack for his help funding and initiating the bluesky project. Today, Bluesky is thriving as an open source social network running on atproto, the decentralized protocol we have built.\" With Mr. Dorsey's exit, only two board members remain at Bluesky: co-founder and CEO Jay Graber, and Jeremie Miller, the inventor of universal messaging standard Jabber/XMPP.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Dorsey backed X as a platform supporting free speech. \"Don't depend on corporations to grant you rights. Defend them yourself using freedom technology. (you're on one),\" he said in a May 4 post on X.\n\n\"We haven't forgotten your PROMINENT role in helping lay the foundation for all this corruption. We look at YOU and laugh when you try to be righteous, when YOU lead the charge in shutting down the spread of info, and shutting up folks who believed something different,\" former NFL athlete Chris Manno said in an X post on May 4 X.\n\nNew York Times bestselling author Roger Stone also slammed Mr. Dorsey. \"You violated antitrust laws. You need to be prosecuted. Enough of the two-tiered justice system,\" he stated.\n\n\"My followers still don't see my posts after your army of government-funded censorship happened,\" said author and podcaster Douglas Karr.\n\nThe industrialist's remarks came after a series of internal communications at Twitter were unveiled which showed the steps taken by the social media platform's staff to suppress, for example, the Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nTwitter had initially financially backed Bluesky after it was formed in 2019. Three years later, the two platforms ended this relationship. As of May 2024, Bluesky has more than 5.5 million users.\n\n\"As a developer, if you try to build a new app (at centralized social media platforms), you have to overcome network effects to rebuild the social graph from scratch, and if you try to build on the APIs [application programming interfaces] of these companies they can cut you off and kill your company in the blink of an eye,\" Bluesky explained.\n\n\"As a creator, you might spend years building an audience only to lose access to it when the platform changes the rules on you.\"\n\n\"What needs to exist is a system that just makes it really easy for the average user to push out their social media content from a place that they own, like a blog, and then make it available on all these different platforms so it doesn't matter which platform you use,\" he said.\n\n\"So this places the locus of control back in the hands of the average person, the end user.\"\n\nHowever, decentralized social media apps may become the target of authoritarian regimes who do not like the fact they have no control over content shared over the networks.\n\n\"We are writing to notify you that your application, per demand from the Cyberspace Administration of China, will be removed from the China App Store because it includes content that is illegal in China, which is not in compliance with the App Store review guidelines,\" Apple said in a notification to Damus.\n\nThe app was only approved for listing in the Apple app store two days earlier.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Today, Bluesky is thriving as an open source social network running on atproto, the decentralized protocol we have built,\" the post read.\n\nNotably, neither Bluesky nor Dorsey provided reasons for his departure.\n\nPrior to the official announcement, Dorsey responded with a brief \"no\" to a query on X about his current status on Bluesky's board.\n\nMeanwhile, Dorsey's recent activity on X, where he promoted grants for open interest protocols and referred to the social network now owned by Elon Musk as \"freedom technology,\" garnered attention.\n\nObservers noted that Dorsey had significantly trimmed down his follow list on the platform, retaining only three individuals:\n\nMusk, Stella Assange (wife of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange), and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nDorsey's decision to maintain Musk on his follow list, coupled with his endorsement of X, suggests a possible reconciliation between the two tech figures.\n\nThis comes after Dorsey publicly criticized Musk's management of X last year, expressing disapproval of the board's decision to sell the platform to him.\n\nBluesky, initially announced by Dorsey in late 2019, aimed to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until March 2023 that Bluesky entered beta testing, finally becoming available to the public on February 7, 2024.\n\nDespite its relatively recent launch, Bluesky boasts around 5.6 million users, according to its own statistics.\n\nDorsey's departure from Bluesky's board comes as his payments company Block has shifted its focus from designing chips to developing a full Bitcoin mining system.\n\nAs reported, Block has unveiled its accomplishment of designing a standalone three-nanometer (3nm) Bitcoin mining chip and disclosed that it is currently collaborating with a leading global semiconductor foundry to finalize the chip's design.\n\nHowever, the company's mining project doesn't stop at chip development. It plans to expand its efforts to include system design as well.\n\nIt is worth noting that Dorsey has also been deeply involved in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIn addition to his role at Twitter, Dorsey served as the CEO of Square Inc., a financial services company that developed the popular mobile payment app, Cash App.\n\nUnder his leadership, Square became one of the earliest mainstream companies to embrace Bitcoin, enabling users to buy, sell, and hold the cryptocurrency directly within the Cash App.\n\nDorsey's personal interest in Bitcoin is well-known, and he has been an outspoken advocate for its adoption and potential to revolutionize the financial industry.", "source": {"uri": "cryptonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptonews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bluesky Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Dorsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communication protocol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Assange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WikiLeaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Snowden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_App", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cash App"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Partners_Programs", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Partners Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06073526/1714980926-1714980778841_processed.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541403", "eventUri": "eng-9541403", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Back in 2019, when he was still Twitter's CEO, Dorsey announced that the company would fund a small team of independent developers to build \"an open and decentralized standard for social media.\"\n\nThat project went on to become Bluesky Social, an open-source microblogging platform that has been posited as an alternative to X. But having been one of its most important supporters for years, Dorsey has now stepped down from his role as a board member and endorsed X.\n\nDespite initially celebrating Musk's acquisition, in posts on Bluesky, Dorsey has since walked back on his endorsement, claiming that \"it all went south\" for the platform after the takeover.\n\nFor a while, Dorsey appeared to favor the new platform over Musk's X. But in mid-2022, he deleted his Bluesky account. And now, he has cut ties with the company entirely.\n\nIn contrast, Dorsey's X account is as active as ever, and on Saturday, May 4, he called the platform \"freedom technology\". However, there is one caveat to his use of the social network. The man who founded Twitter only follows 3 other accounts.\n\nThe 3 X Accounts Followed by Jack Dorsey\n\nUntil recently, Dorsey followed over 4,600 X accounts - nearly 8 times more than the platform's current owner. But at some point in the last year, he unfollowed the vast majority of them.\n\nNow, Dorsey only follows Musk, Edward Snowden and Julian Assange's wife, Stella.\n\nAlthough he never explained the decision, Dorsey's Spartan timeline aligns him with the pro-free speech, anti-censorship politics espoused by Musk, Snowden and Assange. Yet the divergences in how Musk and Dorsey have run X suggest the 2 men don't exactly see eye-to-eye on the matter.\n\nDorsey the Free Speech Champion?\n\nIn his latest statement referring to X as a \"freedom technology,\" Dorsey advised people not to depend on corporations to defend their rights. Yet comments on the post accused him of hypocrisy.\n\n\"The king of censorship has spoken,\" one user wrote. Another accused Dorsey of allowing the government to censor conservatives, claiming that \"it took a bigger and better man\" to end the practice.\n\nThe criticism adheres to a vision of X perpetuated by its current owner, who likes to depict the platform as a bastion of free speech, in contrast with its more censorious model under Dorsey.

Dorsey also added X to this technology class by conveying that companies could also build on open protocols.\n\nLatest technology news here: Newslinker.co\n\nDorsey has reduced the list of people he follows on X to just three: Musk, Edward Snowden, and Stella Assange, the wife of the imprisoned WikiLeaks publisher. This shows a significant warming of relations between Dorsey and the owner of X, following Musk's takeover of Twitter at Bluesky a year ago and its radical transformation, which Dorsey said made \"everything go wrong.\"\n\nNo Longer on the Board\n\nBluesky was in the spotlight as a decentralized service and protocol network idealized by Jack Dorsey for Twitter. This service was launched with the aim of realizing Dorsey's vision of an uncontrolled communication platform and opened to everyone interested in February.\n\nIn its early days, it became a major attraction for those wanting to escape the chaos on Twitter following Elon Musk's purchase of the platform. However, since then, it has been overshadowed by the launch of Meta Platforms Inc's Threads. When asked if he still holds a position on the Bluesky board, Dorsey simply replied, \"no.\"\n\nDorsey's Company Makes New Bitcoin Move\n\nThe payment company led by Jack Dorsey, named Block, had launched a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) program to further expand its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves. Accordingly, the company began using 10% of its monthly gross profit in April to purchase Bitcoin, and emphasized its goal to continue this step throughout the rest of 2024.\n\nThe $80 million gross profit earned by Block in the first quarter could add an additional $24 million worth of Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet through this program. This move aims to strengthen the company's Bitcoin reserves and solidify its presence in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this article does not constitute investment advice.

To get it in your inbox, subscribe here.)\n\nDeepfakes during Indian elections trigger arrests\n\nIndia's ruling BJP has condemned the use of deepfakes and morphed media in order to misrepresent its ideology and plans for the country as India's elections take place and millions head to the polls across its states. Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a strong statement and claimed that the videos aimed to cause social and civil unrest. Meanwhile, Federal Home Minister Amit Shah shared both real and morphed clips of him speaking, in order to clarify his point. He claimed that the Congress party was behind the false media. At least nine people, including six members of the Congress party who were working on its socials across various states, were arrested for allegedly circulating the media.\n\nIndia's elections will continue until June; the country has almost one billion voters and more than 800 million internet users. While tech giants and social media companies have promised to assist the government in stopping the spread of fake news and false media, the ongoing polls have been dubbed India's first 'AI elections.'\n\nApple records drop in quarterly revenue\n\nDays ahead of an eagerly awaited Apple event on May 7, the iPhone-maker reported quarterly revenue of $90.8 billion, which has fallen by 4% year-over-year. A large factor behind this was a drop in the net sales of iPhones, iPads, and wearables in the past one year. However, Apple also announced a high-profile $110 billion stock buyback.\n\nRevenue from iPhone sales fell to reach $45.7 billion. This was $51.3 billion a year earlier. Apple is dealing with falling demand in China as Huawei rises in popularity in the country. In Western countries, Apple is also being overshadowed by Samsung handsets. On the bright side, Apple customers are looking forward to iPad-related announcements during the upcoming event.\n\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has left Bluesky board\n\nTwitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey is no longer on the board of Bluesky, the decentralised social media platform he envisioned. Bluesky confirmed the news and said it was looking for a new board member in order to replace Dorsey, who also confirmed his departure with a single-word response on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nAfter Twitter was sold to Elon Musk for $44 billion, Dorsey was part of the Bluesky project and its board. Bluesky's actual CEO is Jay Graber, who has showcased the platform as a less toxic place where users can follow subjects of their choice and choose their own moderation controls. However, The Verge reported that Dorsey shut down his Bluesky account months ago. The platform has over 1.5 million users, compared to the tens of millions of accounts on X.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bluesky Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Dorsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Graber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Graber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/6b3l6y/article68144677.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-05-02T083207Z_2042174149_RC23I7ASHSRD_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ELECTION.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541403", "eventUri": "eng-9541403", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1357, "textEnd": 1362}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

It's a new tech event-filled week. For now, let's get into today's tech news.\n\n1. Mobile app for protecting Aussie data coming\n\nAttorney-General Mark Dreyfus has announced that, in the upcoming Budget, an $11 million package will be provided to establish an app and a website that protects the credentials of Australians from cyber criminals. The app and website will build on the Credential Protection Register, which was established after the Optus data breach, with the Attorney-General saying that it has helped block over 300,000 stolen credential attempts since. \"The mobile application will allow an individual to be notified, in real-time, if someone is using their identity without their consent,\" Dreyfus said. \"Individuals will then be able to act immediately to control their identity credentials by enabling or disabling their use for verification.\"\n\n2. Speaking of privacy\n\nThe Guardian reports that Australia's Privacy Commissioner is raising the flag on third-party suppliers, labelling them a \"real weak spot\" for protecting the credentials of Australians, following the NSW and ACT clubs data breach last week. \"Being a point of vulnerability for others in terms of compliance with Privacy Act is very real and what we're cautioning organisations about is ensuring that they're passing on their obligations in the best way possible in any contract with third parties,\" Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind said.\n\n3. Google bans ads promoting deep fake porn\n\nGoogle has updated its advertising policies, drawing a line in the sand for any content that links to websites and apps that make deep fake pornography, per Engadget. The rule will come into effect on May 30, giving advertisers time to adjust to the new rules, which will be brought into line with other types of sexual content - though obviously, deep fake tools have been under intense scrutiny as of late for their ability to create abuse imagery.\n\n4. Jack Dorsey leaves Bluesky board\n\nJack Dorsey, the former head of Twitter, has left the board of Bluesky, the app he set up to at one point be an extension of Twitter and eventually evolved into a competitor. Dorsey confirmed that he left the board in a Tweet over the weekend, though it isn't clear when he left the board. \"With Jack's departure, we are searching for a new board member for the Bluesky public benefit company who shares our commitment to building a social network that puts people in control of their experience. More to come!\" Bluesky wrote in a statement.\n\n5. Microsoft hits the brakes on AI features\n\nThe latest blog post from Microsoft's Insider blog, directed at Windows users who have signed up to be early adopters of Windows updates, notes that the company will be slowing down its updates. \"We have decided to pause the rollouts of these experiences to further refine them based on user feedback. Copilot in Windows will continue to work as expected while we continue to evolve new ideas with Windows Insiders.\" Lmao.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachariah_kelly@gizmodo.com.au", "name": "Zachariah Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General_for_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attorney-General for Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Dreyfus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Commissioner_of_Canada", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy Commissioner of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Optus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bluesky Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Dorsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Capital Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Australian Capital Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Early adopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Computers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gizmodo-2024-05-06T090734.876.png?quality=75", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541403", "eventUri": "eng-9541403", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 1686, "textEnd": 1692}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

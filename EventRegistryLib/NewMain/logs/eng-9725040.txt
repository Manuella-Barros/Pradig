However, relations with the interim Kabul government gradually deteriorated over the issue of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants using Afghan soil to attack Pakistan.\n\nLast year, Pakistan launched a crackdown on illegal aliens, mostly Afghans, and so far, over half a million are reported to have gone back to Afghanistan.\n\nLast year in October, the caretaker government announced the decision to expel all illegal foreigners, which hit the Afghans living in Pakistan especially hard.\n\nThe deportation of illegal Afghan refugees has been going on since the government's ultimatum for them to leave Pakistan by November 1, last year.\n\nPakistan refused to relax the drive against illegal Afghans despite requests by Kabul, but a meeting between UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday raised hopes that Islamabad may reconsider the drive.\n\nA statement attributed to Grandi also showed that Pakistan would stop expelling Afghans, but Baloch said that Pakistan was committed to implementing the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.\n\nShe said the first phase of this plan is near completion and alluded to the illegal foreigners, including Afghans repatriated to their home countries.\n\nThe spokesperson clarified that Pakistan had not given any understanding to the UNHCR for the plan's suspension.\n\nHowever, she pointed out that the government has approved a one-year extension of the validity of the Proof of Registration cards of Afghan refugees.\n\nBaloch also rejected any talks with the TTP by saying that the terrorist entity was involved in the killing of Pakistani and foreign citizens inside Pakistan.\n\nShe also said Pakistan respects Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n\"We expect the Afghan authorities to uphold their sovereignty and take action against terrorist groups which have found sanctuaries inside Afghanistan and use their territory for terrorist attacks against

His eighth martyrdom anniversary was observed on July 8th,\" she remarked.\n\nCommenting on Israeli aggression in Gaza, Baloch said Pakistan strongly condemned this week's indiscriminate attacks by Israel on four schools in the besieged territory, which resulted in the massacre of dozens of women and children seeking shelter there.\n\nThese attacks are further evidence of Israel's genocidal

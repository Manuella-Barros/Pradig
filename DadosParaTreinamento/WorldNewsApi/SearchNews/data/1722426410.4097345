{"id": 243401412, "title": "US Has Sent Israel Thousands Of 2,000-pound Bombs Since Gaza War Started: Report - Iran Front Page", "text": "The US has transferred at least 14,000 of the MK-84 2,000-pound bombs, 6,500 500-pound bombs, 3,000 Hellfire precision-guided air-to-ground missiles, 1,000 bunker-buster bombs, 2,600 air-dropped small-diameter bombs, and other munitions, according to the officials. The tally of shipments suggests there has been no significant drop-off in US military support for Israel. \u201cWhile these numbers could be expended relatively quickly in a major conflict, this list clearly reflects a substantial level of support from the United States for our Israeli allies,\u201d Tom Karako, a weapons expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters. Earlier this week, a senior Biden administration official said that the US sent $6.5bn worth of weapons to Israel since the war began. Israel, flouting a United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive on Gaza since an Oct. 7 attack last year by Hamas. More than 37,700 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, most of them women and children, and over 86,500 others injured, according to local health authorities. Over eight months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine. Human rights organizations have warned that thousands of people in the besieged enclave are facing the risk of famine amid ongoing Israeli devastating onslaught.", "summary": "<p><img src=\"https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4a6f6a96-9f0d-4cd0-b7c3-37db258cebe9-1.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin: 1em auto\"></p>\n<p>The administration of US President Joe Biden has sent to Israel massive shipments of munitions, including more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000-pound bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles, since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, two US officials have said, Reuters news agency reported.</p>", "url": "https://ifpnews.com/us-israel-thousands-2000-pound-bombs-gaza-war-report/", "image": "https://ifpnews.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=302167&type=iran-front-page&hash=49ac9082dcec42a1b0ce7b52ae71af10", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:03:34", "author": "Ifp Media Wire", "authors": ["Ifp Media Wire"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ir", "sentiment": -0.217}

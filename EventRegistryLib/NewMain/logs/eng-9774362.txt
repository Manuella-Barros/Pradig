"Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (R) and his wife Begona Gomez (L) attend a Spanish royal commemoration event - Copyright AFP/File Juan Medina\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is set to testify on Tuesday in a preliminary graft probe into his wife's business dealings, a case that has piled pressure on his fragile minority government.\n\nHe has denied any wrongdoing by his wife, Begona Gomez, and dismissed the allegations as part of a right-wing smear campaign against his leftist government.\n\nBut the case has stoked acrimony in Spanish politics, with the conservative opposition calling on him to resign.\n\nGomez is being investigated for alleged influence peddling and corruption following a complaint filed by an anti-graft NGO with links to the far right called \"Manos Limpias\" -- Spanish for \"Clean Hands\".\n\nJudge Juan Carlos Peinado, who is heading the inquiry, is scheduled to question the Socialist premier as a witness at his official residence at 11:00 am (0900 GMT).\n\nThe only other time a sitting Spanish prime minister had to testify in a judicial case was in 2017, when Mariano Rajoy was summoned in a graft case that led to the conviction of several members of his conservative Popular Party (PP).\n\nSanchez asked to testify in writing as is allowed under Spanish law for top government officials, but Peinado rejected the request, arguing he would quiz him as Gomez's spouse.\n\nThe premier can now choose to remain silent but \"politically this could look bad\", said University of Alicante criminal law professor Bernardo del Rosal.\n\n\"Not answering the judge, or answering in writing, could create the image that he is arrogant,\" Del Rosal told AFP.\n\n- 'Noise' -\n\nGomez, who has worked in fundraising for years, invoked her right to remain silent under questioning by the judge earlier this month.\n\nShe is alleged to have used her husband's position as leverage within her professional circles, notably with businessman Juan Carlos Barrabes, who was seeking public funding.\n\nIn his testimony, Barrabes -- who teaches part of a master's course at Madrid's Complutense University that is run by Gomez -- acknowledged meeting her five or six times at Moncloa, the premier's official residence.\n\nSanchez was also present at two of those meetings, he said.\n\nBarrabes -- who got two letters of recommendation from Gomez before pitching for a public tender worth several million euros -- said they only talked about matters of innovation, judicial sources said.\n\nManos Limpias has said its allegations against Gomez were entirely based on media reports, which could turn out to be false.\n\nSpanish prosecutors have failed to get the case dismissed.\n\nEven if a court eventually decides to shelve the case without a trial, \"all this noise\" will damage the PM's image, Del Rosal said.\n\n- 'Rally support' -\n\nSanchez's supporters have accused Peinado, whose daughter is a PP city councillor, of political bias.\n\nThe judge has taken controversial decisions seen as being in sync with the right, such as in 2015 when he accepted another complaint from Manos Limpias over tweets made by two leftist Madrid city councillors deemed offensive.\n\nPeinado will allow a lawyer from the far-right party Vox to question Sanchez as part of the probe.\n\nVox is taking part in the investigation as a so-called \"popular prosecutor\" -- a set-up under Spanish law that allows citizens or organisations to be an accuser in court.\n\nWhen the probe was opened in April, Sanchez took five days off to consider his future but ultimately stayed on.\n\nFederico Santi, senior analyst for Europe at Eurasia Group, said Sanchez \"is leveraging the issue to rally support within his

Eamonn Holmes hits out at Olympics opening ceremony AAA: Car thefts are on the rise, including in the Bronx 'Tying themselves in knots': Camilla Tominey on what could BRING DOWN Labour government\n\nBarrabes -- who got two letters of recommendation from Gomez before pitching for a public tender worth several million euros -- said they only talked about matters of innovation, judicial sources said.\n\nManos Limpias has said its allegations against Gomez were entirely based on media reports, which could turn out to be false.\n\nSpanish prosecutors have failed to get the case dismissed.\n\nEven if a court eventually decides to shelve the case without a trial, \"all this noise\" will damage the PM's image, Del Rosal said.\n\n- 'Rally support' -\n\nSanchez's supporters have accused Peinado, whose daughter is a PP city councillor, of political bias.\n\nThe judge has taken controversial decisions seen as being in sync with the right, such as in 2015 when he accepted another complaint from Manos Limpias over tweets made by two leftist Madrid city councillors deemed offensive.\n\nPeinado will allow a lawyer from the far-right party Vox to question Sanchez as part of the probe.\n\nVox is taking part in the investigation as a so-called \"popular prosecutor\" -- a set-up under Spanish law that allows citizens or organisations to be an accuser in court.\n\nWhen the probe was opened in April, Sanchez took five days off to consider his future but ultimately stayed on.\n\nFederico Santi, senior analyst for Europe at Eurasia Group, said Sanchez \"is leveraging the issue to rally support within his left-wing base with some success\".\n\nSanchez, who has been in office since 2018, has struggled to pass legislation since he returned to power last year after an inconclusive election.\n\nds/mdm/ju/imm/smw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_silva@reformer.com", "name": "Daniel

In 2015 he accepted another Manos Limpias complaint over tweets made by two leftist Madrid city councillors deemed offensive.\n\nPeinado will allow a lawyer from the far-right party Vox to question Sanchez as part of the probe.\n\nVox is taking part in the investigation as a so-called \"popular prosecutor\" a set-up under Spanish law that allows citizens or organisations to be an accuser in court.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the PM's residence, Vox spokesman Jorge Buxade said Sanchez was \"nervous\" because before a judge \"he can't do what he does in parliament, which is mock those who ask questions, remain silent or lie\".\n\nWhen the probe was opened in April, Sanchez took five days off to consider his future but ultimately stayed on.\n\nSanchez, who has been in office since 2018, has struggled to pass legislation since he returned to power last year after an inconclusive election.\n\nbur-ds/spb", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

prime minister as a witness but he invoked his right not to testify, lawyers who were present at the hearing told reporters.\n\nUnder Spanish law, one can refuse to answer questions in a case affecting close family members, including spouses.\n\n\"The hearing lasted exactly two minutes,\" Antonio Camacho, the lawyer for Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez, told reporters outside the residence, adding that Sanchez was \"absolutely calm\".\n\nGomez also invoked her right to remain silent under questioning by the judge earlier this month.\n\nShe has not spoken publicly about the case but Sanchez has denied any wrongdoing by his wife and dismissed the allegations as part of a right-wing smear campaign against his left-wing government.\n\nThe case has stoked acrimony and the main opposition conservative opposition Popular Party (PP) has urged Sanchez to resign.\n\n\"Sanchez has not wanted to testify before the courts but he will answer to the Spanish people,\" PP leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo wrote on social network X shortly after the hearing ended.\n\n- 'Look bad' -\n\nGomez is being investigated for alleged influence-peddling and corruption following a complaint filed by an anti-graft NGO \"Manos Limpias\" -- Spanish for \"Clean Hands\" -- which has links to the far right.\n\nThe only time a sitting Spanish prime minister has testified in a judicial case was

declines to testify in wife's graft probe", "body": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez refused on Tuesday to answer question from a judge investigating alleged influence-peddling by his wife, a case that has put pressure on his fragile minority government.\n\nJudge Juan Carlos Peinado, who is heading the preliminary inquiry, went to Sanchez's official residence to question the Socialist prime minister as a witness but he invoked his right not to testify, lawyers who were present at the hearing told reporters.\n\nUnder Spanish law, one can refuse to answer questions in a case affecting close family members, including spouses.\n\n\"The hearing lasted exactly two minutes,\" Antonio Camacho, the lawyer for Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez, told reporters outside the residence, adding that Sanchez was \"absolutely calm\".\n\nGomez also invoked her right to remain silent under questioning by the judge earlier this month.\n\nShe has not spoken publicly about the case but Sanchez has denied any wrongdoing by his wife and dismissed the allegations as part of a right-wing smear campaign against his left-wing government.\n\nThe case has stoked acrimony and the main opposition conservative opposition Popular Party (PP) has urged Sanchez to resign.\n\n\"Sanchez has not wanted to testify before the courts but he will answer to the Spanish people,\" PP leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo wrote on social network X shortly after the hearing ended.\n\n- 'Look bad' -\n\nGomez is being investigated for alleged influence-peddling and corruption following a complaint filed by an anti-graft NGO \"Manos Limpias\" -- Spanish for \"Clean Hands\" -- which has links to the far right.\n\nThe only time a sitting Spanish prime minister has testified in a judicial case was in 2017, when Mariano Rajoy was summoned in a graft case that led to the conviction of several members of his party, the PP.\n\nSanchez asked to testify in writing, as allowed under Spanish law for top government officials, but Peinado rejected the request, arguing he would quiz him in his role as Gomez's spouse.\n\nThe premier has the right to remain silent but \"politically this could look bad\", University of Alicante criminal law professor Bernardo del Rosal told AFP.\n\n\"It could create the image that he is arrogant,\" he added.\n\nSanchez presided over a regular cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning and is set to travel to the Mediterranean island of Mallorca for a summer holiday audience with King Felipe VI.\n\nMore from this section Paris Braced for Invasion of Sex-Crazed

Lebanon Amid Spiralling Situation\n\nGomez, who has worked in fundraising for years, is alleged to have used her husband's position as leverage within her professional circles, notably with businessman Juan Carlos Barrabes, who was seeking public funding.\n\nIn his testimony, Barrabes -- who teaches part of a master's course at Madrid's Complutense University that is run by Gomez -- acknowledged meeting her several times at the premier's official residence.\n\nSanchez was present at two of those meetings, he said.\n\nBarrabes -- who obtained two letters of recommendation from Gomez before pitching for a public tender worth several million euros (dollars) -- said they only talked about matters of innovation, judicial sources said.\n\n- Controversial decisions -\n\nSpanish prosecutors have failed to have the case dismissed.\n\nSanchez's supporters have accused Peinado, whose daughter is a PP city councillor, of political bias.\n\nThe judge has taken controversial decisions seen as favouring the right.\n\nIn 2015 he accepted another Manos Limpias complaint over tweets made by two left-wing Madrid city councillors deemed offensive.\n\nPeinado allowed a lawyer from the far-right party Vox to accompany him to question Sanchez as part of the probe.\n\nVox is taking part in the investigation as a so-called \"popular prosecutor\" -- a set-up under Spanish law that allows citizens or organisations to be an accuser in court.\n\nWhen the probe was opened in April, Sanchez took five days off to consider his future but ultimately stayed on.\n\nSanchez, who has been in office since 2018, has struggled to pass legislation since he returned to power last year after an inconclusive general election.\n\nbur-ds/gil", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

In 2015 he accepted another Manos Limpias complaint over tweets made by two leftist Madrid city councillors deemed offensive.\n\nPeinado will allow a lawyer from the far-right party Vox to question Sanchez as part of the probe.\n\nVox is taking part in the investigation as a so-called \"popular prosecutor\" -- a set-up under Spanish law that allows citizens or organisations to be an accuser in court.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the PM's residence, Vox spokesman Jorge Buxade said Sanchez was \"nervous\" because before a judge \"he can't do what he does in parliament, which is mock those who ask questions, remain silent or lie\".\n\nWhen the probe was opened in April, Sanchez took five days off to consider his future but ultimately stayed on.\n\nSanchez, who has been in office since 2018, has struggled to pass legislation since he returned to power last year after an inconclusive election.\n\nbur-ds/spb\n\nMore from this section\n\nPIC's WooSOS Plugin Streamlines Ecommerce

Under Spanish law, close relatives including spouses can refuse to answer questions when summoned by a judge.\n\nPeinado interviewed Sanchez in the Moncloa palace government headquarters in Madrid where Sanchez has his official residence. A small group of protesters congregated outside shouting slogans against Sanchez and his Socialist Party.\n\nPeinado was accompanied by Gomez's counsel, representatives of the prosecutor and a lawyer for far-right party VOX, which uses a legal instrument known as \"the people's accusation\" which lets private individuals bring criminal complaints against third parties.\n\nIn late April, Sanchez took a five-day break from his duties to weigh whether to resign after the court opened the investigation, but ultimately decided to stay on.\n\nIt is the first time a sitting Spanish prime minister has been called to testify in a judicial case since his predecessor Mariano Rajoy was summoned as a witness in 2017 in a graft case.\n\nThe case led to the conviction of several members of his conservative People's Party and ultimately to a 2018 vote of no confidence that allowed Sanchez to become prime minister.", "source": {"uri": "dubaieye1038.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dubai

testify in writing, as allowed under Spanish law for top government officials, but the courts rejected the request, arguing he would be questioned in his role as Gomez's spouse.\n\nSpain's state legal

"title": "Pedro Sanchez latest: Spain's prime minister to sue judge after being forced to testify in case against his wife - Olive Press News Spain", "body": "SPAIN'S Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez exercised his right to not testify before a judge today, as part of an ongoing judicial probe into allegations of corruption and influence peddling levelled against his wife, Bego\u00f1a Gomez.\n\nAfter the brief face-to-face with Judge Juan Carlos Peinado at La Moncloa prime ministerial palace on Tuesday morning, it emerged that Sanchez was filing a lawsuit against the magistrate via Spain's State Attorney's Office.\n\nWhile Gomez has kept silent about the ongoing investigation into her activities, Sanchez has publicly stated on a number of occasions that she has done nothing wrong and has denounced the probe as an effort to undermine both him and his government, a coalition of the Socialist Party and leftist alliance Sumar.\n\nWhat's more, not only had Gomez's defence lawyers appealed the judge's decision to make Sanchez testify, but so had the public prosecutor.\n\nRead more: Wife of Spain's Pedro Sanchez is cleared by police: Guardia Civil find no evidence against Bego\u00f1a Gomez after she was accused of 'peddling influence'\n\nGomez has been accused of taking advantage of Sanchez's role as prime minister to gain advantage within her professional career.\n\nThe allegations were first filed at the Madrid court in charge of the probe back in April by Manos Limpias, a union that has links to the far-right.\n\nHowever, those allegations were based on newspaper clippings about Gomez, some of which have already been proven to be false.\n\nSince then, the lawsuit has been joined by Hazte Oir (Make Yourself Heard), a Catholic association known for its anti-abortion campaigning.\n\nOn July 19, Gomez herself was called to testify by Judge Peinado, but she, like her husband, also opted to say nothing.\n\nThe judge is reportedly investigating Gomez's dealings with businessman Juan Carlos Barrabes, who was at one time seeking public funding and received \u20ac23 million in public contracts.\n\nAfter the judge came face-to-face with Sanchez today at La Moncloa, the latter filed the lawsuit against Peinado in 'defence of the institution of the prime minister's office', government sources told Spanish daily El Pais.\n\n\"There are multiple elements that make it evident that the statement taken contravenes the rules that regulate it, stripping the person who holds the role of prime minister of one of the powers of the State of the guarantees offered by the Law of Criminal Procedure since 1882,\" the 35-page lawsuit states.\n\nThe document also points out that Sanchez was not permitted to testify in writing, as is usual for members of the government.\n\nThe State Attorney also argued in the lawsuit that there is a contradiction in the actions of the judge, on the basis that he is trying to question Sanchez as Gomez's husband, when she is being investigated for being the prime minister's wife.\n\nToday marked the first time that a Spanish prime minister has been called to testify in court since Mariano Rajoy, a former prime minister for the conservative Partido Popular (PP), was called as a witness in a corruption case related to his party back in 2017.\n\nIn April, when news of the lawsuit against Gomez broke, Sanchez took the unprecedented step of a five-day break from his official duties while he considered whether to continue as prime minister of Spain.\n\nAfter this period he decided to continue, but pledged a crackdown on press outlets publishing what he called 'unfounded' attacks against his wife.", "source": {"uri": "theolivepress.es", "dataType": "news", "title": "Olive Press News Spain"},

Her lawyer later told the media that she did not cooperate because the judge said all of Gomez's activities since her husband became prime minister would be investigated.\n\n\"Our position is that the process lacks any clear goals ... a judge cannot investigate anything, there should be limits to guarantee the rights of those under investigation,\" her lawyer said at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain's main opposition party says their refusal to testify makes them all the more suspicious.\n\n\"It looks bad,\" Popular Party spokesperson Miguel Tellado told media on Tuesday. \"Spain doesn't deserve a government that lies and steals.\"", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yeni \u015eafak"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yeni_safak@yenisafak.com", "name": "Yeni \u015eafak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "piri_medya_a_s@yenisafak.com", "name": "Piri Medya A.\u015e.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danilo Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_G\u00f3mez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian G\u00f3mez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pa\u00eds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "El Pa\u00eds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Party_(Spain)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "People's Party (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://img.piri.net/piri/upload/3/2024/7/31/68b59286-0d8ur5q33vprjiuldzlfbos.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774362", "eventUri": "eng-9774362", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Her lawyer later told the media that she did not cooperate because the judge said all of Gomez's activities since her husband became prime minister would be investigated.\n\n\"Our position is that the process lacks any clear goals ... a judge cannot investigate anything, there should be limits to guarantee the rights of those under investigation,\" her lawyer said at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain's main opposition party says their refusal to testify makes them all the more suspicious.\n\n\"It looks bad,\" Popular Party spokesperson Miguel Tellado told media on Tuesday. \"Spain doesn't deserve a government that lies and steals.\"", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danilo Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Moncloa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Moncloa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pa\u00eds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "El Pa\u00eds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vox (political party)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Party_(Spain)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "People's Party (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/07/30/thumbs_b_c_fb6767d22c2c82e8d21344a68663145c.jpg?v=182719", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774362", "eventUri": "eng-9774362", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Marta Castro, a lawyer for Vox, confirmed the Prime Minister's refusal to answer questions, stating, \"Sanchez invoked his right not to testify.\"\n\nThe investigation focuses on allegations that Gomez used her position as the Prime Minister's wife to secure sponsors for a university master's degree course she ran. Sanchez has vehemently denied these accusations, labelling them as politically motivated attacks orchestrated by right-wing opponents.\n\n\"These accusations are baseless and orchestrated by our political foes,\" Sanchez has stated in his defense.\n\nThe inquiry at Moncloa, Sanchez's official residence and government headquarters in Madrid, marks a significant moment in Spanish politics.

"body": "He has denied any wrongdoing by his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, and dismissed the allegations as part of a right-wing smear campaign against his leftist government.\n\nBut the case has stoked acrimony in Spanish politics, with the conservative opposition calling on him to resign.\n\nG\u00f3mez is being investigated for alleged influence peddling and corruption following a complaint filed by an anti-graft NGO with links to the far right called \"Manos Limpias\" -- Spanish for \"Clean Hands\".\n\nJudge Juan Carlos Peinado, who is heading the inquiry, is scheduled to question the Socialist premier as a witness at his official residence at 11:00 am (0900 GMT).\n\nThe only other time a sitting Spanish prime minister had to testify in a judicial case was in 2017, when Mariano Rajoy was summoned in a graft case that led to the conviction of several members of his conservative Popular Party (PP).\n\nS\u00e1nchez asked to testify in writing as is allowed under Spanish law for top government officials, but Peinado rejected the request, arguing he would quiz him as G\u00f3mez's spouse.\n\nThe premier can now choose to remain silent but \"politically this could look bad\", said University of Alicante criminal law professor Bernardo del Rosal.\n\n\"Not answering the judge, or answering in writing, could create the image that he is arrogant,\" Del Rosal told AFP.\n\n'Noise'\n\nG\u00f3mez, who has worked in fundraising for years, invoked her right to remain silent under questioning by the judge earlier this month.\n\nShe is alleged to have used her husband's position as leverage within her professional circles, notably with businessman Juan Carlos Barrab\u00e9s, who was seeking public funding.\n\nIn his testimony, Barrab\u00e9s - who teaches part of a master's course at Madrid's Complutense University that is run by G\u00f3mez - acknowledged meeting her five or six times at Moncloa, the premier's official residence.\n\nS\u00e1nchez was also present at two of those meetings, he said.\n\nBarrab\u00e9s - who got two letters of recommendation from G\u00f3mez before pitching for a public tender worth several million euros - said they only talked about matters of innovation, judicial sources said.\n\nManos Limpias has said its allegations against G\u00f3mez were entirely based on media reports, which could turn out to be false.\n\nSpanish prosecutors have failed to get the case dismissed.\n\nEven if a court eventually decides to shelve the case without a trial, \"all this noise\" will damage the PM's image, Del Rosal said.\n\n'Rally support'\n\nS\u00e1nchez's supporters have accused Peinado, whose daughter is a PP city councillor, of political bias.\n\nThe judge has taken controversial decisions seen as being in sync with the right, such as in 2015 when he accepted another complaint from Manos Limpias over tweets made by two leftist Madrid city councillors deemed offensive.\n\nPeinado will allow a lawyer from the far-right party Vox to question S\u00e1nchez as part of the probe.\n\nVox is taking part in the investigation as a so-called \"popular prosecutor\" -- a set-up under Spanish law that allows citizens or organisations to be an accuser in court.\n\nWhen the probe was opened in April, S\u00e1nchez took five days off to consider his future but ultimately stayed on.\n\nFederico Santi, senior analyst for Europe at Eurasia Group, said S\u00e1nchez \"is leveraging the issue to rally support within his left-wing base with some success\".\n\nS\u00e1nchez, who has been in office since 2018, has struggled to pass legislation since he returned to power last year after an inconclusive election.", "source": {"uri": "thelocal.es", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Local Spain"}, "authors": [],

proceedings are part of a preliminary investigation into whether Begona Gomez used her position as the premier's wife to secure sponsors for a university master's degree course that she ran.\n\nSanchez has denied the accusations against her, saying they were baseless and orchestrated by right-wing political foes.\n\nInvestigating judge Juan Carlos Peinado arrived at the government headquarters where Sanchez has his official residence in Madrid on Tuesday morning, a Reuters journalist said, in an unprecedented visit to interview the prime minister.\n\nHe will be accompanied by his counsel, representatives of the prosecutor and a lawyer of far-right party VOX, which uses a legal instrument known as \"the people's accusation\" which lets private individuals bring criminal complaints against third parties.\n\nA small group of protesters congregated outside La Moncloa palace shouting slogans against Sanchez and his Socialist Party.\n\nIt is the first time a sitting Spanish prime minister has been called to testify in a judicial case since his predecessor Mariano Rajoy was summoned as a witness in 2017 in a graft case that led to the conviction of several members of his conservative People's Party and ultimately to a 2018 vote of no confidence that allowed Sanchez to become prime minister.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

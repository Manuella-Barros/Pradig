{"id": 223693364, "title": "Suspended as Biden Special Envoy, now teaching at the Ivies", "text": "Imagine this headline: Alec Baldwin, on trial for involuntary manslaughter during film shoot, teaching seminar on Hollywood gun safety. Ludicrous, right? The real-life story of Rob Malley \u2014 Biden\u2019s ex-Special Envoy to Iran and a lead negotiator in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal \u2014 is equally perplexing. When news spread last weekend of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s death in a helicopter crash, social media exploded with sarcastic sympathy posts to Malley for his long-suspected Tehran ties. But behind every joke lies a measure of truth. Last June, Malley (one of Biden\u2019s first appointees) was suspended from the State Department for allegedly transferring classified material to his personal email, where \u2014 according to insiders and Republican lawmakers \u2014 it was likely intercepted by a \u201chostile cyber actor,\u201d possibly the Islamic Republic of Iran given Malley\u2019s history with the regime. Since then, details surrounding Malley\u2019s suspension and subsequent FBI investigation have remained murky. Answers trickled in from, of all places, Iran\u2019s state-run Tehran Times. Last July, the paper managed to obtain a sensitive government memorandum from April 2023 in which Erin Smart, director of the State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Office, told Malley that his mishandling of classified information made him a national security risk. Two months later, he was suspended from the State Department. So, what do public figures do when embroiled in an ongoing investigation for possible national security violations? In Malley\u2019s case, teach \u2014 what else? \u2014 national security and Middle Eastern foreign policy at the Ivy Leagues. When Yale and Princeton hired Malley last August, Yale vaguely noted that he was \u201con leave from the US State Department.\u201d True, Malley hasn\u2019t been found guilty of a crime and innocent people are often investigated by the FBI, so why can\u2019t he teach? He certainly has the pedigree having served in the Clinton, Obama and Biden administrations. Because despite those hefty bona fides, Malley is a national security risk and a less-than-ideal instructor on the very subjects under which he\u2019s being investigated. At least until his name clears. Even then, Malley remains an improbable academic \u2014 with more worrisome baggage than just his Washington troubles. First there\u2019s International Crisis Group (ICG), the conflict-resolution NGO Malley helmed before becoming Biden\u2019s Iran envoy. Based in Brussels \u2014 but with deep ties to Washington and other Western capitals \u2014 ICG entered into a formal research agreement for \u201cscientific and academic interactions\u201d with Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry in 2016 during a pause in Malley\u2019s leadership. This connection between the ICG and Iran was not publicly disclosed, according to Semafor, before Malley was appointed special envoy \u2014 the question is why? No one\u2019s entirely sure because the exact contours of the ICG-Tehran agreement have yet to be revealed. Meanwhile, last September, Semafor and leading anti-regime outlet Iran International connected Malley\u2019s aides to the \u201cIran Experts Initiative (IEI),\u201d an informal information platform launched by Iran\u2019s foreign ministry in 2014 to influence US foreign policy in favor of Tehran. (In an email to The Post, an ICG spokesperson described these allegations as \u201cmisleading media characterizations;\u201d ICG\u2019s chief of advocacy has also described the IEI\u2019s work as an independent and \u201cinformal platform backed by\u201d Western governments). Among the Western analysts involved in the IEI was Malley prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ali Vaez, whom Malley recruited in 2012 as Iran project director at the ICG, where he remains today. Vaez regularly appears on Western news programs opining on Iran\u2019s nuclear future. Yet there is no indication that he\u2019s revealed his involvement in the Tehran-run IEI and their efforts to manipulate US foreign policy. In fact, in 2014 \u2014 while working under Malley \u2014 Vaez emailed then-Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to reaffirm his fealty to the Islamic Republic. \u201cAs an Iranian, based on my national and patriotic duty, I have not hesitated to help you in any way,\u201d Vaez wrote. Is it any wonder Vaez\u2019s security clearance was later denied when Malley tried to recruit him into the State Department following Biden\u2019s arrival to the Oval Office? Neither Malley nor Vaez responded to multiple requests for comment; it\u2019s unclear whether Vaez\u2019s security clearance was ever approved. The madness doesn\u2019t end there. Following the Oct. 7 massacre and subsequent war in Gaza, Malley has been teaching a Yale course called \u201cContending with Israel-Palestine.\u201d Yet Malley\u2019s background suggests he\u2019s anything but the impartial academic such coursework demands. While serving as an informal Middle East advisor for then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008, Malley held direct meetings with Hamas \u2014 a diplomatic no-no. Malley says he never hid the Hamas encounters, but according to Politico, he was forced to sever ties with the Obama administration after this news became public. (Curiously, Malley was later brought on by the Obama in 2015 to help with their ISIS strategy.) Then there\u2019s his father, Simon Malley \u2014 a Syrian-Egyptian journalist with equally concerning connections to Israel-Palestine. The elder Malley was a dear comrade to Yasser Arafat, according to his son. \u201cMy father felt close to Arafat,\u201d the younger Malley told a crowd at Oxford University in 2008. Some national security insiders even allege that Arafat was the younger Malley\u2019s unofficial godfather. Today, Malley is back on campus tasked with delivering a balanced perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict while his ties to Tehran, the chief patron of Hamas and Hezbollah, are probed. Huh? No matter how the federal investigations into Malley ends, the entire process has been woefully opaque. For now, at least, Malley remains suspended from diplomatic duties in Washington. So why then is he teaching diplomacy to America\u2019s future leaders?

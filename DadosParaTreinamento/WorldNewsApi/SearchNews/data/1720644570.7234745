By the final siren, they had completed 26 of 34 chances - many of those mistakes coming within 20-minutes - and looked a far cry from the side who charged to last year\u2019s grand final. Brisbane captain Pat Carrigan, stepping in for the still injured Adam Reynolds, was typically tireless after his Maroons\u2019 heroics - finishing with 149 metres and 48 tackles But around him his teammates crumbled coming out of the sheds, the usually reliable Tristan Sailor committing three of their 12 errors. Sione Katoa, Brayden Trindall and Blayke Brailey all scored within 15-minutes on the back of dropped Brisbane ball.", "summary": "Was this State of Origin fatigue, or a complete fade out?

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said the policy will generate roughly \u00a31.5bn a year, which Labour plans to invest in state education, including in recruiting more teachers. Labour\u2019s Ms Thornberry was asked about the potentially thousands of students who are expected to leave private schools because of the 20% rise in prices as a result of the introduction of VAT. She told GB News: \u201cCertainly, some schools that have vacancies \u2013 my primary schools and my secondary schools have space and they\u2019re very welcome. \u201cThey are good schools and people should send their children there. I mean, it\u2019s fine, and if we have to, in the short term, have larger classes, we have larger classes.\u201d She continued: \u201cAll we need to do is we need to raise the money in order to make sure that children who go into state schools have had breakfast. \u201cThat\u2019s what our priority is, and we need to raise the money from somewhere. What we\u2019re going to do is we are saying everything we\u2019re going to spend money on, where money is coming from because we will have a proper manifesto. \u201cAll our spending commitments will be costed, and we will be able to say where it comes from and, sure, there may well be complaints about it. \u201cI understand that, but I\u2019m afraid that if I have a choice between putting VAT on private schools and making sure that the children in my area can have breakfast before they start learning, I know where I am.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not much to ask and if it means putting VAT on private schools \u2013 the question is, is it appropriate in these circumstances for schools, such as in Eton or Winchester or whatever, to be seen as a charity and that, therefore, they should not be paying VAT on the huge fees that are already charged?\u201d Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said pupils would be impacted by \u201cLabour\u2019s politics of envy\u201d. She said: \u201cToday Labour admitted their tax raid will lead to \u2018larger classes\u2019 in state schools, punishing children to pay for their plans. \u201cIt\u2019s not just hard-working parents who will pay the price for Labour with \u00a32,094 of extra taxes, it\u2019s also our children who will be impacted by Labour\u2019s politics of envy. \u201cThe choice is clear: stick with the clear plan that is working, taking bold action to drive up school standards with Rishi Sunak. Or go back to square one with Keir Starmer and larger school class sizes, damaging children\u2019s futures.\u201d", "summary": "Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said pupils would be impacted by \u2018Labour\u2019s politics of envy\u2019.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/emily-thornberry-labour-gillian-keegan-institute-for-fiscal-studies-education-secretary-b1163150.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/09/14/02a3174996d063c5521977b40ee28e1dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE4MDIzNTQz-2.76192989.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:06:33", "author": "Claudia Savage", "authors": ["Claudia Savage"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.138}

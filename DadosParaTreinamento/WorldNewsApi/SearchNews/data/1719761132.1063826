Technology and industry practices have evolved, spurred on by the Covid-19 pandemic creating a need to innovate. For example, a March 2023 Pew Research Center report showed that 35% of U.S. workers were working remotely full time and 41% were using a hybrid schedule of both in-office and remote work. As a third-party payroll and human resources solutions provider, my company frequently helps clients update and upgrade their payroll and employee management to continue to meet changing standards and best practices in their industries. This has put me in a position to see a number of changes that have been made and changes coming soon that I believe all employers should be aware of and prepared to make. Recent Improvements With new technology and best business practices, payroll and human management in many industries has become more efficient, accurate and beneficial to both employers and employees. The U.S. Chamber of commerce reported in August 2023 that businesses are transitioning to online payroll in greater numbers; payroll processes are having to adjust more to hybrid and remote employees; compliance and data integrity are spurring the development of automated updates to payroll tech; and payroll accessibility is proving popular among gig economy members. New payroll technology has streamlined previously manual processes, making them more practical. Payroll systems security has also improved, thanks to new verification measures. For example, the business software and service consultancy Software Suggest lists limited access, password policies and software among their top 12 recommended payroll security measures. Less data entry is required for many payroll and management functions, and more information is becoming available online and via mobile devices, which can help make onboarding, training and continuing education easier for employees both new and long-standing.

Here are seven areas of advancements of which I\u2019ve become aware. \u2022 Online Benefits Administration: Systems are being improved and developed to help employers and employees better manage employee benefits such as health insurance, mileage reimbursement and stock options. \u2022 Employee Onboarding: Global corporate training consultancy TrainingFolks recently reported on how technology can be used to streamline the onboarding process for employers, such as through self-directed changes and updates to employee training programs and through learning management systems for new-hire training. \u2022 Scheduling And Time Management: Systems are being updated to improve employee scheduling and time management by making it easier to assign shifts, record hours worked and calculate overtime. According to Shiftboard\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Travis Shipley, \u201cModern scheduling tools with AI enhance efficiency, offer unbiased scheduling, and facilitate swift adjustments for better collaboration.\u201d \u2022 Remote Work Functionality: More employees are finding that working from home helps them achieve a better work-life balance and reduce stress without sacrificing efficiency; a March 2023 report from Pew Research Center shows that 71% of U.S. teleworkers find remote work helps with balancing their work and personal life, and 56% find it helpful for meeting deadlines and completing assignments. Technology is assisting employers and employees with coordinating and staying in touch over long distances, creating a wider hiring pool for businesses. In April 2024, global hiring company Horizons reported that effective remote work is best facilitated with video conferencing tools, project management tools, messaging apps and more. \u2022 Biometric Payroll Technology: Security is a vital aspect of any payroll system, and technology using biometric ID verification can make it easier to let employees access their payroll and keep unauthorized people out. \u2022 AI Acceleration: AI and machine-learning algorithms can be used to automate processes, analyze data, detect fraud and more. More companies are introducing machine learning into more and more aspects of their business, including payroll and management, and continually developing AI to further speed up calculations, estimations and projections. \u2022 Internal Communications: Human resource tools are being developed to improve communication between employers and staff, making it easier for everyone in a business to work together. AI can be used for suggesting effective communication approaches with staff, as well as tailoring content to connect with employees, while a number of digital tools exist to monitor performance and feedback. Preparing For Future Payroll Advances With more great advances on the way in payroll and employee management, it\u2019s important for employers to be ready to adapt to the changes in their own industries. The first thing I advise doing is putting together a team of technical and administrative advisors. They and you should also regularly evaluate your business\u2019s practices for areas where adopting new tech and new practices would improve the payroll system, employee administration and more. Consider also purposefully moving away from systems and practices that have become impractical, inefficient and/or obsolete. Evalute any system that is still handled manually for automation opportunities, such as recording employee work hours. An Employer\u2019s Duty As new tools are made available, it falls to the professionals to familiarize themselves with the proper places for these tools in their industries. Continuing to meet the current practices can help keep a business viable and competitive when vying for both customers and new hires. I believe that staying current with the standards on how to pay your staff and how to direct them isn\u2019t just smart business\u2014it\u2019s a responsibility we as business leaders have to the people who rely on us for their livelihoods.

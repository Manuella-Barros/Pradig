They noted that the entire process had numerous flaws.\n\n\"The 2024 Venezuelan presidential election did not meet international standards of electoral integrity and cannot be considered democratic,\" it states in a statement released through the official page of the international organization late Tuesday, July 30, two days after the elections.\n\nThe Carter Center, which was invited as an international observer to the Venezuelan elections, states that it cannot verify or corroborate the authenticity of the presidential election results declared by the National Electoral Council (CNE) of Venezuela.\n\n\"The fact that the electoral authority has not announced results broken down by polling station constitutes a serious violation of electoral principles,\" they affirm.\n\nThey claim that during the electoral process, \"CNE authorities showed bias in favor of the ruling party and against opposition candidacies.\"\n\nIn their statement, they detail that they deployed 17 technicians with teams in the cities of Barinas, Maracaibo, Valencia, and Caracas, and that \"the observations were limited, especially on election day.\"\n\nVenezuela's 2024 presidential election did not meet international standards of electoral integrity and cannot be considered democratic.\n\nThe Carter Center cannot verify or corroborate the results of the election declared by the National Electoral Council (CNE), and the electoral authority's failure to announce disaggregated results by polling station constitutes a serious breach of electoral principles.\n\nVenezuela's electoral process did not meet international standards of electoral integrity at any of its stages and violated numerous provisions of its own national laws. The election took place in an environment of restricted freedoms for political actors, civil society organizations, and the media. Throughout the electoral process, the CNE demonstrated a clear bias in favor of the incumbent.\n\nVoter registration was hurt by short deadlines, relatively few places of registration, and minimal public information. Citizens abroad faced excessive legal requirements to register, some of which appeared to be arbitrary. This effectively disenfranchised most of the migrant population, resulting in very low numbers of voters abroad.\n\nThe registration of parties and candidates also did not meet international standards. Over the past few years, several opposition parties have had their registrations changed to leaders who favor the government. This influenced the nomination of some opposition candidates. Importantly, the registration of the candidacy of the main opposition forces was subject to arbitrary decisions of the CNE, without respecting basic legal principles.\n\nThe electoral campaign was impacted by unequal conditions among candidates. The campaign of the incumbent president was well funded and widely visible through rallies, posters, murals, and street campaigning. The abuse of administrative resources on behalf of the incumbent -- including use of government vehicles, public officials campaigning while in their official capacity, and use of social programs -- was observed throughout the campaign.\n\nThe incumbent also enjoyed overwhelming positive coverage on television and radio, in terms of advertising, broadcast events, and news coverage, while the primary opposition candidate received little media coverage. In addition, authorities frequently attempted to restrict the opposition's campaign activities. This included harassment or intimidation of people who provided services or goods to the main opposition campaign.\n\nStill, Venezuelan citizens turned out peacefully and in large numbers to express their will on election day. Despite reports of restrictions on access to many polling centers for domestic observers and opposition party witnesses; potential pressure on the voters, such as ruling party checkpoints in the vicinity of voting centers; and incidents of tension or violence reported in some localities; voting appeared to take place in a generally civil manner.\n\nIn the limited number of polling centers they visited, Carter Center observer teams noted the desire of the Venezuelan people to participate in a democratic election process, as demonstrated through their active participation as polling staff, party witnesses, and citizen observers. However, their efforts were undermined by the CNE's complete lack of transparency in announcing the results.", "source": {"uri": "havanatimes.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Havana Times"},

This monitoring team was present during the election held on a recent Sunday.\n\nAfter the elections concluded, the CNE, which is mainly comprised of government supporters, proclaimed that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was the victor. This announcement has been met with substantial opposition, as Maduro's challengers assert that their candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, actually won with a considerable lead.\n\nIn a statement released shortly after the elections, the Carter Center indicated that it was unable to \"verify or corroborate the results\" declared by the CNE.\n\nFurthermore, the Carter Center criticized the CNE for not disclosing detailed voting results by polling station, which they deem a serious violation of electoral standards. They alleged that the CNE exhibited a noticeable bias in favor of President Maduro and pointed to the organization's \"complete lack of transparency\" in the results announcement.\n\nThe Carter Center's findings contribute to the growing pressure from various nations and organizations, including the United States, Brazil, and the European Union, all of whom are demanding the CNE release comprehensive voting data broken down by polling locations.\n\nThis statement represents a significant shift in tone, as the Carter Center had previously expressed positive remarks about Venezuela's electoral system. Past commendations from the organization were often used by President Maduro as endorsements of his administration, including a notable quote from the Center's founder, former US President Jimmy Carter, who had praised the Venezuelan electoral process in the past.\n\nThe declared results have triggered widespread protests across Venezuela, leading to thousands taking to the streets multiple days in a row. Human rights groups have reported at least 11 fatalities related to the unrest, along with numerous injuries.\n\nIn an official statement, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino characterized the demonstrations as an attempted coup, insisting that the armed forces would take necessary measures to maintain order.\n\nAccording to Venezuela's attorney general, over 700 individuals have been arrested during the ongoing demonstrations, with two members of the security forces reported dead due to the unrest.\n\nOpposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado has called for her supporters to remain peaceful, despite provocations from government forces. Following the election results, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, an ally of Maduro, demanded the arrest of both Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez, accusing them of orchestrating a \"fascist conspiracy.\"\n\nIn light of the escalating conflict, the Costa Rican foreign minister extended an offer of political asylum to Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez, citing potential arrest warrants against them.

renowned NGO that was invited by Venezuelan officials to monitor Sunday's presidential poll has said the election \"cannot be considered democratic\".\n\nThe US-based Carter Center deployed 17 experts and observers to Venezuela after being asked to monitor the election by the National Electoral Council (CNE).\n\nOn Monday, the CNE - which is dominated by government allies - declared President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro the winner, but the result has been disputed by the opposition which says voting tallies show its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, has won by a wide margin.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, the Carter Center said that it could not \"verify or corroborate the results of the election declared by CNE\".\n\nThe Carter Center also said that the CNE's failure to announce the detailed results by polling station \"constitutes a serious breach of electoral principles\".\n\nIt added that the CNE had \"demonstrated a clear bias in favour of the incumbent [President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro]\" and accused the CNE of a \"complete lack of transparency in announcing the results\".\n\nWith its statement, the Carter Center has joined a long list of countries and organisations pressuring the CNE to release detailed voting data at the polling station level, among them the US, Brazil and the EU.\n\nHowever, the statement by the Carter Center is likely to sting the Maduro government because its observers had been complimentary about the Venezuelan electoral system in the past.\n\nPresident Maduro has often quoted a remark by the Carter Center's founder, former US President Jimmy Carter, who in 2012 said that \"of the 92 elections that we've monitored, I would say the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world\".\n\nThe disputed result announced by the CNE has trigged a wave of protests in Venezuela with thousands taking to the streets for a second day on Tuesday.\n\nNGOs say there have been at least 11 deaths in protest-related violence and that dozens more have been injured.\n\nDefence Minister Vladimir Padrino read out a statement on Tuesday branding the protests \"a coup\" which he said the armed forces would defeat.\n\nMore than 700 people have been detained, according to Venezuela's attorney general, who also said that two members of the security forces had died in the protests.\n\nThe opposition leader, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, has urged her supporters to remain peaceful even if provoked by the government and its allies.\n\nOn Tuesday, a close ally of President Maduro, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, called for the arrest of Ms Machado and Mr Gonz\u00e1lez, accusing them of leading a \"fascist conspiracy\".\n\nThe Costa Rican foreign minister later offered Ms Machado and Mr Gonz\u00e1lez political asylum, saying that his government \"had been informed of arrests warrants\" against the two.\n\nMs Machado thanked the Costa Rican government but said that it was her \"responsibility to continue this struggle alongside the people\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The failure of the electoral authority to announce results broken down by polling station constitutes a severe violation of electoral principles,\" the institution said in an official statement released on July 30.\n\nAdditionally, they indicate that the electoral process was conducted in an environment of restricted freedoms, affecting political actors, civil society organizations, and media outlets.\n\nAccording to the report, the electoral authority showed bias in favor of the ruling party, which disadvantaged opposition candidates. There is also criticism regarding the updating of the voter registry, highlighting numerous issues such as short deadlines and limited registration locations, both inside and outside the country. This problem resulted in low registration of new voters, especially abroad.\n\nRegarding the parties and candidates, the Carter Center denounces that the registration of the main opposition forces was subject to the discretion of the electoral authorities, who made arbitrary decisions. The electoral campaign was also criticized for its significant imbalance in favor of the government. The report mentions the abusive use of public resources and the predominance of the ruling party's candidacy in the media, as well as the persecution and intimidation of those who supported the opposition.\n\nThe Carter Center acknowledged the massive and peaceful mobilization of Venezuelan citizens on July 28. However, it regrets that these efforts were undermined by the CNE's lack of transparency in disseminating the results.\n\nThe organization announced that it will publish a final report detailing all the findings of its mission in Venezuela.\n\nOn Sunday, Venezuelans went to the polls seeking democratic change to end more than two decades of Chavista dictatorship, but Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared himself the victor. Opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado rejected the official results and accused the government of manipulating the elections. Machado claimed that the \"newly elected president\" is the candidate from the Democratic Unity Platform (PUD), Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia. She also stated that they have legal evidence to prove the frauds committed by Maduro's government to stay in power.\n\nThe Carter Center was founded in 1982 by Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn. It is a non-profit organization based in Atlanta, Georgia, and works in partnership with Emory University. It is currently led by John Moores. Among its activities, it acts as an electoral observer, mediator in international crises, and promoter of health programs in Latin America and Africa.

The Atlanta based organisation, one of the few international groups invited to observe the election, criticised the government for not providing individual polling station results.\n\n\"The electoral authority's failure to announce disaggregated results by polling station constitutes a serious breach of electoral principles,\" the Carter Centre declared.The group's statement marks one of the strongest condemnations yet of Venezuela's electoral process, which it claims did not meet international standards and \"cannot be considered democratic.\"\n\nThe controversy intensified as opposition leaders, led by Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, alleged that their candidate won by a landslide. Gonz\u00e1lez's team released what they claim are tally sheets showing him with over twice as many votes as incumbent Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nDespite this, Maduro was declared the winner by the National electoral council, which has not released the detailed vote counts.\n\nUS president Joe Biden and Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva have called for Venezuela to release the full voting data. In a joint statement, they emphasised that the election's outcome \"represents a critical moment for democracy in the hemisphere.\"\n\nIn Caracas, protests erupted as thousands of opposition supporters gathered, demanding transparency. Maria Corina Machado, a leading opposition figure, urged the electoral council to publish the tally sheets, declaring, \"Why don't they publish them?\" The protests have seen some violence, with over 700 arrests reported and one officer killed.\n\nThe Organisation of American States (OAS) criticised the Venezuelan government for not releasing the data and suggested a new election monitored by international observers. The OAS stated, \"The worst form of repression is to prevent the people from finding solutions through elections.\"\n\nMaduro's government has responded strongly, accusing opposition leaders of inciting violence and calling for their arrest. National assembly president Jorge Rodriguez labelled the opposition as \"violent fascists\" and praised the crackdown on protests.\n\nUnited Nations Human Rights Chief Volker T\u00fcrk expressed concern over the situation, stating, \"I am alarmed by reports of disproportionate use of force by law enforcement officials along with violence by armed individuals supporting the government.\"\n\nAs Venezuela faces ongoing unrest and economic instability, the legitimacy of the election and the government's response continue to be hotly debated, with international observers and local citizens alike calling for greater transparency.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

You can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here. Not bad today. My opening guess CRATE left me with just 11 remaining words. CHOIR only slashed that to 4, but I had three boxes, two of which were green. I thought of both COWER and COVER at this point, and almost went with the former. But my gut told me COVER was a more likely answer, and I was right! Competitive Wordle Score I knew today would be a tie, and sure enough the Wordle Bot also guessed in three. So I get 1 point for guessing in three and zero for the tie. Hey, at least he didn\u2019t beat me! How To Play Competitive Wordle Guessing in 1 is worth 3 points; guessing in 2 is worth 2 points; guessing in 3 is worth 1 point; guessing in 4 is worth 0 points; guessing in 5 is -1 points; guessing in 6 is -2 points and missing the Wordle is -3 points. If you beat your opponent you get 1 point. If you tie, you get 0 points. And if you lose to your opponent, you get -1 point. Add it up to get your score. Keep a daily running score or just play for a new score each day. Today\u2019s Wordle Etymology The word \"cover\" comes from the Middle English \"coveren,\" which originated from the Old French word \"covrir.\" This Old French term, in turn, derived from the Latin word \"cooperire,\" which means \"to cover completely.\" The Latin \"cooperire\" is a combination of \"co-\" (a prefix meaning \"together\" or \"completely\") and \"operire\" (meaning \"to cover\"). The evolution of the word reflects its consistent meaning related to protection or concealment.

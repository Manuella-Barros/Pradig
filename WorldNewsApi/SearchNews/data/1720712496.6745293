{"id": 232038462, "title": "So far, &#8216;deflection,&#8217; no answers on politician collusion allegations: experts", "text": "A former RCMP superintendent says the Liberal government is passing the buck by insisting it\u2019s up to Canada\u2019s national police force to decide what to do about parliamentarians accused of helping foreign states. \u201cThis, in my view, is total deflection,\u201d Garry Clement told Mercedes Stephenson in an interview with The West Block. \u201cThe laws are not there right now.\u201d Last Monday, a report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) alleged that sitting federal politicians are \u201cwitting\u201d participants in foreign interference schemes. The committee did not name names, and the Liberal government is resisting calls to release their identities, citing concerns about sharing sensitive intelligence information. On Thursday, opposition MPs at a House of Commons committee pressed Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc to name names, but he refused, saying it would be \u201csimply irresponsible.\u201d LeBlanc said the RCMP will decide whether to investigate and lay charges, adding that is the process in a rule-of-law democracy. Clement, who spent 30 years with the RCMP, says the legislation is not in place to bring \u2018witting\u2019 collaborators to justice. \u201cWe need our politicians, at least somebody there to show some leadership and not put their head in the sand as they are today and say, \u2018Well, see, RCMP has (the) responsibility and we\u2019ll continue as we have always.'\u201d The NSICOP report drew a similar conclusion about the difficulty of prosecuting parliamentarians suspected of colluding with foreign states. \u201cSome (of the activities) may be illegal, but are unlikely to lead to criminal charges, owing to Canada\u2019s failure to address the long-standing issue of protecting classified information and methods in judicial processes.\u201d Since the release of the NSICOP report, the government has faced mounting pressure to reveal the identities of the federal politicians who \u201cwittingly\u201d aided foreign governments. It\u2019s not clear which parties they belong to, how many parliamentarians are involved, or if they\u2019re sitting in the House of Commons or Senate. LeBlanc, along with NSICOP chair David McGuinty, said they can\u2019t make the names public because they\u2019re bound by Canada\u2019s official secrets law, the Security of Information Act, and risk prosecution. But Clement says he \u201cstrongly believes\u201d Canadians have a right to know. \u201cMy reaction to the Liberals is, shame on you for not (releasing the names) as politicians, shame on you, prime minister.\u201d University of Ottawa national security professor Thomas Juneau also stressed the need for transparency but said releasing names is \u201ccomplicated.\u201d \u201cThe lack of transparency here is casting a shadow on the system as a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cThat being said, there are privacy issues, there are classification issues, there are ongoing investigations.\u201d Juneau suggests a certain threshold must be met before releasing the information. \u201cWhere\u2019s the minimal bar to be transparent when you have suspicions, but no proof, where a wrong accusation could seriously damage not just the career, the overall life of an individual?\u201d he asked. With the House of Commons expected to rise in a few weeks, Juneau is urging the government to pass Bill C-70 as quickly as possible. The Liberal government tabled Bill C-70, a sweeping piece of legislation meant to tackle foreign interference, which would include a registry of people in Canada acting on behalf of foreign governments. \u201cWe need a much more serious national security culture in Parliament,\u201d Juneau said. \u2014 with files from Alex Boutilier", "summary": "A former RCMP superintendent says the Liberal government is passing the buck, after allegations parliamentarians are colluding with foreign states.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10553219/former-rcmp-superintendent-nsicop-report/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024060512064-f12191ebf627dfffc1b803427fdf57a05a006ed2ff3e2037e2d8808e9af9353f.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:00:49", "author": "Touria Izri", "authors": ["Touria Izri"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.106}

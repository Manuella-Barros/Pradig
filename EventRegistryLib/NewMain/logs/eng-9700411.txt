He responded: \"Not at this stage.\"\n\nDonaldson is accused of one charge of rape, four of gross indecency and 13 charges of indecent assault.\n\nThe charges span a time period between 1985 and 2008.\n\nDonaldson has previously indicated that he will contest the charges against him.\n\nEleanor Donaldson faces charges of aiding and abetting in connection with the alleged offences.\n\nThere was a significant police presence when Donaldson arrived at Newry courthouse, but no repeat of the chaotic scenes of his last appearance in April.\n\nThe small courtroom was packed for the hearing. Donaldson and his wife sat separated by court custody officers at the back of the room.\n\nJeffrey Donaldson wore a navy blue suit and sported a beard. Eleanor Donaldson wore a cream jacket.\n\nAfter confirming their names and addresses, the charges were read in the preliminary enquiry (PE) hearing.\n\nThe hearing was to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to progress the case to crown court trial.\n\nDonaldson is now facing 18 historical sex offence charges following a review of the case by Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service. He had originally faced 11 charges when he first appeared in court in April.\n\nHis wife is facing five charges.\n\nThere are two alleged victims.\n\nDistrict Judge Eamonn King said: \"I am satisfied on the basis of the papers before the court that there is a prima facie case to answer.\"\n\nThe court clerk then asked the defendants if they wanted to say anything at this stage in answer to the charges.\n\nJeffrey Donaldson said: \"Not at this stage.\"\n\nHis wife said: \"No\".\n\nDonaldson made the same response when asked if he wanted to tender any written statements of evidence at this stage of the proceedings.\n\nBoth were released on continuing bail until September 10.\n\nIt has already been confirmed that Donaldson, who was the long-standing MP for Lagan Valley, is not running for re-election in the UK General Election this week.\n\nHe was arrested and charged in relation to the historical sexual allegations at the end of March.\n\nDonaldson resigned as DUP leader and was suspended from the party after the allegations against him emerged.\n\nIt is understood that in a letter to DUP party officers at the time, he made clear he would be \"strenuously contesting\" all charges against him.\n\nWeeks prior to his arrest, he had led the DUP back into Stormont following a two-year boycott of the powersharing institutions.\n\nPrevious deputy leader Gavin Robinson has

Getty Images\n\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, the former leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and his wife Lady Eleanor Donaldson will face trial on historical sex offense charges.\n\nThe husband and wife appeared in Newry Magistrates' Court this morning, Wednesday, July 3, for a preliminary enquiry.\n\nJeffrey Donaldson is facing 18 charges - one charge of rape, four of gross indecency, and 13 charges of indecent assault.\n\nThe alleged offenses occurred between 1985 and 2008.\n\nJeffrey was initially facing 11 charges - one of rape, one of committing an act of gross indecency, and nine of indecent assault - but after the evidence file was reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS), the number of charges was increased to 18.\n\nLike her husband, Eleanor's charges were increased from four to five following the PPS review.\n\nEleanor now faces five charges - aiding and abetting rape between 1987 and 1991, three counts of aiding and abetting indecent assaults on a female child, and one count of child cruelty between 2004 and 2008.\n\nThe charges relate to two alleged victims.\n\nThe original holding charges were withdrawn in court on Wednesday.\n\nDistrict Judge Eamonn King said in court on Wednesday that he was satisfied there was a prima facie case to answer and adjourned the case to Newry Crown Court for arraignment on September 10. The husband and wife will have to enter a plea on that date.\n\nWhen asked if they would like to make a written or oral statement in court on Wednesday, Jeffrey said \"not at this stage,\" while Eleanor said \"no.\"\n\nThe couple, who previously said they \"strenuously deny\" the charges against them, remains on bail - Eleanor is staying in Co Down while Jeffrey is staying in London.\n\nThe trial is expected to begin early next year.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) previously confirmed that on Thursday, March 28, its detectives \"arrested and charged a 61-year-old man for non-recent sexual offences\" and that \"a 57-year-old woman was also arrested and charged at the time for aiding and abetting additional offences.\"\n\nAs is usual, the PSNI did not name the people who had been arrested.\n\nJeffrey Donaldson's social media accounts were deactivated the night of the arrests.\n\nThe following day, the DUP confirmed that Jeffrey Donaldson was stepping down as Party Leader with immediate effect after he was charged with \"allegations of a historical nature.\"\n\nDonaldson was suspended from the DUP pending the outcome of a judicial process and Gavin Robinson MP has been named the Interim Party Leader.\n\nDonaldson, a former member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), became head of the DUP in 2021 following Edwin Poots' short-lived tenure. He had been an MP for Lagan Valley since 1997.\n\nOn May 22, British Prime Minister called a General Election for the United Kingdom to be held on July 4 and that British Parliament must be dissolved by May 30.\n\nJeffrey Donaldson's solicitor John McBurney confirmed on May 24 that his client would not be standing for reelection.\n\n\"I can indicate that it is not Jeffrey's intention, of course, to stand for re-election,\" he told reporters, according to the PA.\n\n\"He will be concentrating on the case and defending the charges.\n\n\"He is continuing as the MP at the present time.\n\n\"There's various matters to be dealt (with), constituency matters and administrative matters to do with his offices and so forth.\"\n\nAs The Irish News notes, Donaldson ceased to be an MP on May 30 when British Parliament was dissolved. If Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hadn't called the election, it's likely the former DUP leader would still be an MP, with his wife still working as his secretary.", "source": {"uri": "irishcentral.com",

Here's what we know so far.\n\nDonaldson was arrested along with his wife Eleanor on the morning of Thursday, March 28 when police arrived at their home in Co Down.\n\nThey were taken to Antrim Police Station where they were questioned separately throughout the day. The pair were later charged that night.\n\nWhat has Donaldson and his wife been charged with?\n\nDonaldson was initially charged with 11 historical sexual offences, while Eleanor Donaldson is facing five aiding and abetting charges. Since the pair last appeared in court seven further charges have been laid against Donaldson.\n\nThe charges against Donaldson relate to two complainants and are alleged to have occurred between 1985 and 2008.\n\nEleanor Donaldson's aiding and abetting charges relate to two complainants and are alleged to have occurred between 1985 and 2006.\n\nWhat has the PSNI said?\n\nWhile not naming Donaldson or his wife, a PSNI spokesperson said after the pair were initially charged: \"Detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland arrested and charged a 61-year-old man for non-recent sexual offences.\n\n\"A 57-year-old woman was also arrested and charged at the time for aiding and abetting additional offences.\n\n\"Both are due to appear before Newry Magistrates Court on April 24.\"\n\nLast month, the PSNI confirmed that an investigation into online comments made after Donaldson's resignation remained ongoing.\n\nWhat has the DUP's reaction been?\n\nThe day after the pair were charged, the DUP named Donaldson as the person in question in a statement and confirmed his resignation, while announcing the appointment of Gavin Robinson as interim party leader.\n\nPrior to his permanent appointment as DUP leader, Mr Robinson described the revelations as \"devastating\".\n\nMore recently, Mr Robinson claimed opponents might use the Donaldson court case for \"party political advantage\" ahead of the General Election.\n\nWhat has Donaldson said?\n\nThe Lagan Valley MP did not comment on his arrest until he appeared in court on Wednesday, April 24, however in a letter to DUP party officers he said he would be \"strenuously contesting\" the charges against him. It is understood Eleanor Donaldson will also be denying the charges. It was also confirmed via his solicitor that Donaldson would not be contesting the July 4 election.\n\nWhere had Donaldson and his wife been in the time since they were charged and first appeared in court?\n\nBail conditions meant the pair could not have any contact with each other. Donaldson has been bailed to an address in London, while Eleanor has been bailed to the family home in Co Down. These bail conditions have since been relaxed.\n\nWhat happened when they first appeared on April 24?\n\nDonaldson and his wife Eleanor appeared at Newry Magistrates Court. They sat in the dock, separated by security staff.\n\nBoth defendants spoke to confirm their names and dates of birth, and that they understood the charges against them. A PSNI officer said he could connect the accused to the charges.\n\nAn application to vary the bail conditions to allow contact between Mr and Mrs Donaldson was granted by the judge.\n\nCrown Prosecution Service counsel said a list of potential witnesses that the accused are prohibited from contacting would be provided to the court, adding that more witnesses have been spoken to since the charges were originally laid.\n\nNeither defendant appeared in court on May 22. In an update, prosecutors informed the court that the case was \"moving expeditiously\" and set a date for a preliminary hearing for July 3.\n\nThere was a slight bail variation regarding the contact with persons of a specific age range. Mr Donaldson was initially banned from contact with persons under the age of 16. On May 22 that was changed to \"no unsupervised contact\" with anyone under the age of 16, and that supervision cannot be carried out by Eleanor Donaldson.\n\nA brief hearing in the case was also held on June 12, when it was confirmed the preliminary hearing would go ahead as planned.\n\nWhat is due to take place in court on July 3?\n\nThis hearing will establish whether there is sufficient evidence to send the pair to trial. The Public Prosecution Service has reviewed that police evidence and charged Donaldson with 18 offences. On Wednesday the these charges will be put to him, while the original 11 charges will be withdrawn at the same time.

The 18 alleged offenses include: one charge of rape, 13 charges of indecent assault of a female child and four charges of gross indecency towards a child.\n\nDonaldson was asked in court if he wanted to comment on the charges, according to PA Media. \"Not at this stage,\" he replied, the news agency reported.\n\nHis wife Eleanor Donaldson is also set to stand trial in September and has been charged with one charge of aiding and abetting rape, three charges of aiding and abetting assault of a female child and one charge of cruelty towards a person under the age of 16.\n\nDonaldson led the DUP from 2019, throughout much of the turbulent Brexit process, regularly voicing his opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, a key part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that ensured there was no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBoth Donaldson and his wife have previously denied all charges, Irish public broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported Wednesday.\n\nDonaldson's trial was announced as people in Northern Ireland were preparing to vote in the UK general election. As one of the UK's four devolved nations, Northern Ireland has 18 seats in the Westminster parliament. Northern Irish politicians can choose to either run for a seat in Westminster or for a seat in the devolved legislature, the Northern Ireland Assembly.

In a letter to party leaders, Donaldson said he would be \"strenuously contesting\" the charges.\n\nHe also quit as a lawmaker in the UK Parliament before Thursday's national election.\n\nHis resignation shocked the DUP just months after the party agreed to return to Northern Ireland's on-again, off-again power-sharing government after he won concessions on Britain's post-Brexit trading arrangements with the European Union.\n\nAs leader of the DUP between 2021 and 2023, he was the most powerful figure in Northern Ireland's unionist movement, which seeks to maintain the region's historic ties to the United Kingdom.

They include:\n\nOne count of aiding and abetting rape Three counts of aiding and abetting indecent assault, and, One count of wilful neglect of a child.\n\nThe defendants were asked if they understood the charges, and each confirmed they did.

A short time later, Eleanor Donaldson was dropped off at court, exiting the same car previously used by her husband.\n\nBoth had undergone subtle but noticeable changes in appearance since their last court appearance on April 24.\n\nDonaldson had grown a full beard, had had a short, back and sides haircut, his regular light grey suit had been swapped for a deep blue, the Ichthus fish pin he was known to wear appeared to be missing.\n\nEleanor Donaldson had had her hair styled into a short bob, and she wore casual trousers, with a silk and wool cream jacket and large pearl earrings.\n\nBoth had been arrested and police-charged on March 28, 2024 and yesterday (Wed) after their second court appearance they were released on continuing bail until September 10..

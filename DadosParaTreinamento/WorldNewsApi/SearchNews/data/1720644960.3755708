{"id": 231330804, "title": "Low Voter Turnout As Local Gov&#039;t Elections Hold In Yobe", "text": "The local government chairmanship and councillorship elections held in Yobe State on Saturday witnessed a low turnout of voters as only a handful of people were at different polling units to elect new chairmen and councillors. Our Correspondent, who visited several polling units, reports that electoral officials, security operatives, and party agents lamented the absence of voters during the exercise. However, voters intermittently strolled to polling booths to cast their votes. No queue was observed at the polling units as a result of the low turnout. Residents went about their normal activities as some opened for business, with many seen at different bus stops trying to commute from one part of the state to another despite the restriction of vehicular movement order announced by the state government. Those who spoke with LEADERSHIP said they were uninterested in the election exercise because the outcome of the election was already known. A voter, Mohammed Kukuwa (Bata Tsari), also attributed the low turnout to the economic hardship being experienced by the people. \u201cLet us say the truth, we don\u2019t really see the work of these local government chairmen. People don\u2019t feel their impact. Also, the votes we have been casting all these years, what is the benefit? I can\u2019t blame anyone that doesn\u2019t come out,\u201d he said. A similar scenario played out at major towns in the State like Potiskum, Nanagere, Gaidam, Tarmuwa, Fune, Gashua, Jakusko, Nguru and Damaturu, the Yobe State capital. However, the election was generally peaceful with many polling units recording zero to low disturbance, while voters were absent in some polling units as at 11am. Speaking after casting his vote at 008 Unit Gubana Primary School of Dogon Kuka Ward, Fune local government area of the State, the deputy governor, Hon. Idi Barde Gubana, commended the State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) for organising a peaceful election. Gubana urged youths in the state to embrace agriculture to sustain their livelihood, pointing out that agriculture was getting momentum across the country. He also suggested that participation in agriculture will go a long way in reducing the impact of galloping food inflation in the country. He said, \u201cYou can see that the exercise is peaceful here, I think this is the way it is in every other units and wards and we expect a peaceful and successful local government elections will usher in a new leadership in the local governments.\u201d The collation officer at Njiwaji polling unit in Gwange Ward, Bukar Ali, expressed satisfaction with the exercise, describing it as generally peaceful.", "summary": "The local government chairmanship and councillorship elections held in Yobe State on Saturday witnessed a low turnout of voters as only a handful of people were at different polling units to elect new chairmen and councillors.

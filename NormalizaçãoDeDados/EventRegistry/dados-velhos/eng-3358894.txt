"Middle-distance finals and 4x400m finals are main attractions on the final day of the ongoing world meet in London.\n\nThe penultimate day (Saturday, August 12) of IAAF World Championships 2017 was filled with heartbreaks. Sprint legend Usain Bolt did not have a fairytale farewell as he fell with an injury during his 4x100m relay final.\n\nThe Jamaican team, which had won the 4x100m event at three consecutive Olympic Games and four straight World Championships, failed to defend their world title as Bolt suffered a horrific end in his sprint career. It was heartbreaking to see the most decorated Olympian succumbing to an injury in his swansong.\n\nOn the other hand, distance-running great Mo Farah too did not have a fitting farewell to his track career as the Great Britain star was denied a chance to complete an unprecedented world double in 5,000m and 10,000m for the third time.\n\nNotably, Farah had won the 10,000m event, much to the delight of the London crowd on the opening day of the ongoing world meet. However, in the 5,000m final on Saturday, he was outclassed by long-time rival Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, who ran a terrific last 300m.\n\nWhat to expect from the last day\n\nLondon will gear up for final day action, which might not be as exciting as yesterday. However, the 4x400m relay final will be one of the main attractions of the day.\n\nWhile the Indian challenge in both the races ended on a disappointing note, there will be Jamaica-United States rivalry, this time in the Women's 4x400m relay.\n\nOn the other hand, Great Britain will be confident of a good show in the men's 4x400m final, especially after their relay team stunned the United States to win Gold in the dramatic 4x100m final yesterday.\n\nFocus on Caster Semenya\n\nSouth African middle-distance sensation Semenya is likely to dominate the proceedings on the day as the 28-year-old reigning Olympic champion is favourite to win women's 800m.\n\nSemenya won a Bronze in the women's 1,500m event in LondonGLYN KIRK/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn Men's High Jump, Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar, the reigning world and Olympic silver medalist, will be bidding to win his first outdoor global title after having set 2.38m in the qualification.\n\nAll eyes will be on Asbel Kiprop as the 28-year-old former Olympic champion will be eyeing a fourth straight World Championships Gold in the 1,500m final today. His Kenyan counterparts Elijah Manangoi and Timothy Cheruiyot are also in line for podium finishes as the country looks to sweep the middle-distance race.\n\nDay 10 schedule\n\nEvent Round Date -- Morning session -- Men's 50km Race Walk Final 7:45am local/12:15pm IST Women's 50km Race Walk Final 7:45am local/12:15pm IST Women's 20km Race Walk Final 12:20pm local/4:50pm IST Men's 20km Race Walk Final 2:20pm IST/6:50pm IST -- Afternoon session -- Men's High Jump Final 7pm local/11:30pm IST Women's Discus Throw Final 7:10pm local/11:40pm IST Women's 5000m Final 7:35pm local/12:05am IST [August 14] Women's 800m Final 8:10pm local/12:40am IST [August 14] Men's 1500m Final 8:30pm local/1am IST [August 14] Women's 4x400m Relay Final 8:55pm local/1:25am IST [August 14] Men's 4x400m Relay Final 9:15pm local/1:45am IST [August 14]\n\nLive streaming and TV coverage information\n\nIndia: TV: Star Sports Select 2/HD 2.

Watch out for the much-anticipated 200m final as well.\n\nSome of the most-anticipated events at IAAF World Championships are scheduled for Thursday, August 10 as we head into the fourth last day of the world meet.\n\nIndia's Govindan Lakshman failed to qualify for the final of Men's 5000m on Wednesday, August 9, but his run that saw him set a new personal best of 13:35.69s came as a relief to fans in the country, who had seen Indian athletes falter in London over the last few days.\n\nCan Neeraj Chopra impress?\n\nThere is much to look forward to on Thursday, as India's brightest medal hope Neeraj will be in action in the Men's Javelin Throw Qualification round.\n\nThe 19-year-old world junior champion has warmed up to his maiden World Championships with some impressive performances. In June 2017, Neeraj threw his season best of 85.63m meters at the Federation Cup Athletics tournament. The said timing is among the top-15 marks of 2017.\n\nAslo read - Neeraj Chopra at IAAF Worlds 2017: Date, time, watch Indian at Javelin Throw event\n\nA month later, Neeraj smashed the meet record at Asian Athletics Championships and finished on the top step of the podium. Top-eight finishes at Diamond League meets in Paris and Monaco in the lead-up to the world meet should have boosted the young athlete's confidence.\n\nJunior world record holder Neeraj Chopra.Joosep Martinson/Getty Images for IAAF\n\nAlso in focus will be India's Davinder Singh Kang, who won the bronze at last month's Asian Championships. Notably, his season best of 84.57m is also among the top-20 of the season.\n\nWho will be 200m champion of the post-Usain Bolt era?\n\nBolt won the 200m world title four times on the trot since 2009, but the Jamaican legend has not taken to track for the said distance in the ongoing edition. It is thus time to crown a new world champion and South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk is the favourite to win the title.\n\nVan Niekerk, who is also touted to be Bolt's successor on the track, is bidding to become the first man since Michael Johnson in 1995 to score a 400m-200m double at World Championships.\n\nThe 25-year-old defended his world 400m title on Tuesday, August 8 with a 43.98s finish. He qualified for the 200m final after finishing third in the semi-final heat. He did not earn an automatic entry, but made the final with his timing of 20.28s, which made him the fastest third-place finisher.\n\nIsaac Makwala is back!\n\nStanding in van Niekerk's way is Makwala, who has the fastest timing (19.77s) this season. The Botswana sprinter missed the 400m final and the 200m heats as he fell victim to an outbreak of sickness that has affected quite a few in London.\n\nIsaac Makwala.JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, after being declared fit, Makwala ran a time of 20.20 seconds in an individual time trial to qualify for the semi-final, in which he clocked 20.14s to make the final.\n\nSchedule Day 7 - August 10\n\nEvent Round Date Women's 5000m Heats 6:30pm local/11pm IST Men's Javelin Throw Qualification Group A 7:05pm local/11:35pm IST Women's High Jump Qualification 7:10pm local/11:40pm IST Women's 800m Heats 7:25pm local/11:55pm IST Men's Triple Jump Final 8:20pm local/12:50am IST [August 11] Men's 1500m Heats 8:25pm local/12:55am IST [August 11] Men's Javelin Throw Qualification Group B 8:35pm local/1:05am IST [August 11] Women's 200m Semi-final 9:05pm local/1:35am IST [August 11] Women's 400m Hurdles Final 9:35pm local/2:05am IST [August 11] Men's 200m Final 9:52pm local/2:22am IST [August 11]\n\nLive streaming and TV coverage information\n\nIndia: TV: Star Sports Select 2/HD 2.

Saturday, August 12 in London. India's 4x400m heats and Davinder Kang's Javelin Throw final are also main attractions.\n\nLondon is all set for an emotional Saturday as two of the world's most celebrated sporting legends are all set to end their careers on the track.\n\nWhile Jamaican sprint star Usain Bolt is slated for the 4x100m heats and final, which will be the last two races his career, Mo Farah will be eyeing a historic third straight world championships double when he takes part in the 5,000m final in the evening session today.\n\nCan Bolt sign off with a Gold?\n\nBolt, who is eyeing his 12th World Championships Gold, will be in action in the morning session in the 4x100m heats. Notably, the 30-year-old missed the 100m title after United States sprinter Justin Gatlin rallied against odds. He chose not to take part in the 200m event and thus Saturday's relay race will be the last time the Jamaican legend will be in action.\n\nNotably, Bolt has won four World Championships Gold as the Jamaican team have been the undisputed champions in the 4x100m relay. The team though will be without Asafa Powell, who failed to recover in time from an injury.\n\nBolt is expected to take part in the heats along with Tyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte, Michael Campbell and the Jamaican team will receive a Yohan Blake boost in the final.\n\nFifth World Championships relay Gold beckons BoltPhil Walter/Getty Images\n\nThe Jamaican has not been beaten in the last four editions of World Championships and also three editions of Olympics. However, they will be facing stiff competition from US, Canada and Japan, who finished with a Silver in Rio.\n\nNotably, Great Britain are also in the race for the title as they have clocked the fastest timing of 38.08s this season.\n\nLondon gearing up for Farah swansong\n\nMeanwhile, London fans will be gearing up to bid farewell to Farah, who is among the favourites to win the 5,000m. Notably, he was pushed to the limits in the 10,000m final on the opening day of the event, but the Great Britain legend fended off stiff challenges.\n\nGearing up to shift focus to marathon events, Farah would want to bid goodbye to the track with another historic finish on Saturday.\n\nIndia events to watch out for\n\nJavelin Throw final\n\nDavinder Singh Kang will be in action in the Men's Javelin Throw final in the afternoon session of the day.

Follow live updates here... Davinder Kang.ANDREJ ISAKOVIC/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWelcome to the live updates of IAAF World Championships 2017 Javelin Throw final, in which India's Davinder Singh Kang will be in action.\n\n1:18am IST: It's over for Davinder. He throws 80.02m in his third attempt, which will not be enough to help him join the top-eight for the last three rounds. It looks like the Punjab athlete struggled due to his shoulder injury concerns.\n\n1:12am IST: Davinder drops to the last spot after Julius Yugo of Kenya, who fouled his first attempt, throws 76.29, surpassing the Indian's mark of 75.40m.\n\n1:05am IST: Disappointing! Davinder comes up with a foul throw in his second attempt. One last throw remaining. He needs to throw more than the 81m-mark to finish among the top-eight.\n\nBizarre!!! Kang runs in and doesn't throw. Goes back to a short run up. Throws a poor one around 70M. Touches the line. DQ.#IAAFWorlds -- Sundeep Misra (@MisraSundeep)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\n1:02am IST: Davinder's first attempt of 75.40m is the lowest among the 12 fair throws in the first-round. He needs to considerably improve to finish among the top-eight and make the last round of the final.\n\n12:58am IST: Nine men have made their first attempt so far, and the Indian holds the last spot.\n\nGermany's Johannes Vetter tops the list with 89.89m. Trinidad and Tobago's Keshorn Walcott is second with 84.48m.\n\n12:55am IST: Davinder Singh's first throw is 75.40m, which is below-par.\n\n12:45am IST: We're all set for the final. Davinder is third on the startlist. Season-topper Vetter is likely to throw fifth.\n\n12:30am IST: While you are waiting for the action to begin, check out what Davinder's coach Kashinath Naik has to say about his ward's chances of finishing on the podium on Sunday.\n\n\"Stat Alert: At the 2015 Worlds, the Gold medal-winning throw was 92.72m, while the Bronze medalist threw 87.64m,\" Kashinath told the Firstpost.\n\n12: 30am IST: Davinder qualified with a throw of 84.22m, which was close to his personal best of 84.57m. His throw is the seventh best among 13 contestants.\n\nHowever, Germany's Johannes Vetter and Thomas Rohler are favourites to finish 1-2 after coming up with the only 90m-plus throws this season.\n\nStat Alert: At the 2015 Worlds, the Gold medal-winning throw was 92.72m, while the Bronze medalist threw 87.64m.\n\n12:25am IST [Sunday]: We are exactly 20 minutes away from the start of the big final. Will Davinder be able to finish on the podium? Tell us in the comments section.\n\nAll you need to know about Davinder Singh Kang | For live streaming information can be found below\n\n12:15am IST: Final format -- A total of 13 athletes will be in action in the final. Each athlete will have three throws in the initial round and the top-eight will progress to the next round of the final. The top eight will then have three more throws, which will determine the medalists.\n\nCheck out our preview below.\n\nLondon will witness the penultimate day action of the world meet on Saturday, August 12. With quite a few big events, including the 4x100m relay and 5,000m final scheduled for the day, the focus shifts to Javelin Throw final, which will see 13 athletes battling for glory.\n\nThe 28-year-old athlete from Punjab exceeded expectations when he outclassed compatriot and world junior champion Neeraj Chopra in the qualification round on Thursday, August 10 to become the first Indian to reach the final of Javelin Throw in a World Championships edition.\n\nTough job awaiting Davinder\n\nDavinder will face an uphill task in the final after qualifying seventh among the 13 finalists. His qualifying throw of 84.22m was close to his personal best of 84.57m, which he achieved in the first leg of India Grand Prix Athletics in Patiala earlier this year.\n\nDavinder's throw was also better than reigning Olympic champion Thomas Rohler's effort of 83.87m in the qualifying round, but the German along with his compatriots Johannes Vetter and Andreas Hofmann have been in brilliant form this season and are looking set to clean sweep the Men's Javelin Throw event.\n\nRohler won the Olympic final with a 90.30m throw and the Bronze medalist Keshorn Walcott threw 85.38m.\n\nLive streaming and TV coverage information\n\nIndia: TV: Star Sports Select 2/HD 2.

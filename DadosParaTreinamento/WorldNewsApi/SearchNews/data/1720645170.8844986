{"id": 231398790, "title": "Jensen Huang created a unique culture at Nvidia that allows the AI chip leader to move \u2018very, very fast\u2019", "text": "But a former employee provided a key insight into CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s management philosophy that has also been key to the company\u2019s stratospheric rise. Rene Haas, CEO of UK chip designer Arm, worked at Nvidia in the early 2010s and told the Financial Times that Huang organized the company around projects rather than traditional hierarchies, allowing him to access any layer of management and get answers directly. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unique culture,\u201d Haas told the FT. \u201cThe benefit of that is transparency and speed. And I think that is one of the things that Nvidia is really, really good at. They move very, very fast, they\u2019re very, very purposeful.\u201d That speed was on full display earlier this month, when Huang surprised Wall Street by laying out a rapid cadence of new AI platforms. Last week, he said Nvidia plans to upgrade its AI accelerators every year as he announced the Blackwell Ultra chip for 2025 and a next-generation platform in development called Rubin for 2026. The Computex trade show in Taiwan this past week fueled continued bullishness on AI and the chip sector, helping briefly boost Nvidia\u2019s market cap to the $3 trillion mark for the first time. That capped an epic rally that has seen the company\u2019s stock soar over 3,100% over the last five years and more than 200% in just the last year. In the process, Huang\u2019s personal wealth has surged too. On Friday, he topped Michael Dell to become the world\u2019s 13th-richest person with a net worth of $106.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. For his part, Huang\u2014who is among the 22 CEOs who founded their Fortune 500 companies\u2014has acknowledged that he is a demanding perfectionist and is not easy to work for. \u201cIt should be like that. If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn\u2019t be easy,\u201d he told 60 Minutes in April.", "summary": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang organized the company around projects rather than traditional hierarchies.", "url": "https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/jensen-huang-nvdia-ceo-management-leadership-organization-culture-ai-chips/", "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155386276-e1717864348622.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:17:18", "author": "Jason Ma", "authors": ["Jason Ma"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.456}

A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of an ongoing investigation, said a body was found on a rocky coast by a private boat and that formal identification was pending. Mosley\u2019s wife said in a statement that her husband took the wrong route on a hike and collapsed in a place where his body couldn\u2019t easily be seen. Mosley went missing on the island of Symi on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cMichael was an adventurous man, it\u2019s part of what made him so special,\u201d Dr. Clare Bailey Mosley said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together.\u201d She thanked the people of the island of Symi, who she said worked tirelessly to find him. \u201cSome of these people on the island, who hadn\u2019t even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It\u2019s clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you.\u201d PHOTOS: Body of missing British TV presenter Michael Mosley found on Greek island Lefteris Papakalodoukas, the island\u2019s mayor, told The Associated Press he was on the boat with members of the media representatives when they saw a body some 20 meters above the Agia Marina beach. \u201cWe zoomed with the cameras and saw it was him,\u201d he said. The mayor said that Mosley appeared to have fallen down a steep, rocky slope, stopping against a fence and lying face-up with a few rocks on top of it. As police officers were retrieving Mosley\u2019s body, one fell on the slope and had to be carried away on a stretcher, local media reported. The body will be taken to the nearby island of Rhodes for autopsy. Mosley, 67, was well-known in Britain for his regular appearances on television and radio and his column in the Daily Mail newspaper. He was known outside the U.K. for his 2013 book \u201cThe Fast Diet,\u201d which he co-authored with journalist Mimi Spencer. The book proposed the so-called \u201c5:2 diet,\u201d which promised to help people lose weight quickly by minimizing their calorie intake two days a week while eating healthily on the other five. He subsequently introduced a rapid weight loss program and made a number of films about diet and exercise. Mosley often pushed his body to extreme lengths to see the effects of his diets and also lived with tapeworms in his guts for six weeks for the BBC documentary \u201cInfested! Living With Parasites.\u201d Mosley had four children with his wife Clare Bailey Mosley, who is also a doctor, author and health columnist. ___ Brian Melley contributed to this report from London.", "summary": "The body of missing British TV presenter Michael Mosley was found on a Greek island Sunday morning after a dayslong search, his family said.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/9/michael-mosleys-body-found-on-greek-island/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/09/Greece_Missing_British_Doctor_52049.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:54:36", "author": "Demetris Nellas", "authors": ["Demetris Nellas"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.236}

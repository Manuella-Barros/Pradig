Counting began for the European elections on Sunday and for the local council elections on Saturday. Voters headed to the polls in three elections on Friday. Sinn F\u00e9in, the main opposition party, is expected to have more councillors elected to local authorities, but not as many as it wanted or expected. Despite a \"disappointing\" performance in the election, Mary Lou McDonald has said she has no plans to step down as Sinn F\u00e9in party leader. Speaking to reporters today, Ms McDonald said: \"It has not been our day, but we will have our day.\u201d She said that the party had made some gains, albeit modest ones. We don\u2019t always get it right, we clearly have lessons to learn. We\u2019ve listened carefully, we will regroup, we will come out, we will do better, and I, as the leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, will lead that,\u201d Ms McDonald said. She admitted that the party was \u201cambitious\u201d in the number of candidates it put forward.", "summary": "Sinn F\u00e9in \"disappointed\" with their performance in the local Irish elections", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80017v9rj8o", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/72a3/live/1c126160-263a-11ef-a13a-0b8c563da930.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:50:23", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.679}

It has been seized of this question and this is in motion right now. We can\u2019t replace (the courts) and we don\u2019t have the power to replace them at all,\u201d he said, noting that judges have twice ruled that there is no urgent reason to remove the encampment. \u201cWe need legal foundation to intervene. Right now we don\u2019t have that. There needs to be an emergency. There needs to be a necessity to intervene. We apply the criminal code. If there are serious infractions that are putting people in danger, then maybe we would evaluate the situation and intervene.\u201d Of the total of 250 hate crimes and hate incidents recorded by the SPVM between Oct. 7, 2023 and June 12, 2024 against the Jewish, Muslim and/or Arab communities, 70 were against members of the Arab and/or Muslim communities and 180 were against members of Jewish communities. (Hate crimes in this context are criminal acts that are motivated by prejudice on the basis of religion. Hate incidents are actions that are not listed as crimes in the criminal code, but that may affect people\u2019s sense of safety, such as the distribution of offensive material, insults and offensive gestures. The SPVM monitors hate incidents in order to intervene before hate crimes are committed.) There were 11 hate crimes against property associated with Arab/Muslim communities and 43 hate crimes against property associated with Jewish communities. There were a total of 33 hate crimes reported against people who are members of Arab/Muslim communities and 59 against members of Jewish communities. There were 26 hate incidents that targeted members of Arab/Muslim communities and 78 hate incidents that targeted members of Jewish communities. Anyone who sees or is a victim of a hate crime or incident should contact 911, their local police station or Infocrime Montreal, where they can report their complaint anonymously, by calling 514-393-1133.\u201d", "summary": "But they say they have no legal foundation to dismantle the Pro-Palestinian encampment.", "url": "https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-consulting-rcmp-in-probe-of-mcgill-encampments-ad-for-revolutionary-lessons", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/0613-city-encampent.jpg", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/sfOfKOkF-SZnIQkEn.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:24:31", "author": "Michelle Lalonde,Montreal Gazette", "authors": ["Michelle Lalonde", "Montreal Gazette"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.695}

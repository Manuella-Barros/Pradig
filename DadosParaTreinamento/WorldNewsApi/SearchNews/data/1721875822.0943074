Duran refused to take it.", "text": "Entering the Red Sox\u2019 game against the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday, Jarren Duran had played in all 76 of Boston\u2019s contests this season. Manager Alex Cora figured he would jokingly attempt to give the outfielder his first day off of the year. Considering how hard Duran has played in 2024 and his improved statistics compared to years past, it almost makes sense that Cora would want to let his leadoff hitter rest as the midway point of MLB\u2019s season approaches. But he\u2019s too hot to be sat right now. Seemingly falling for the prank, Duran refused to accept what he deemed to be an offer, not an order. \u201cLast night, I called him into the office and said, \u2018Hey, you got an off day tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Cora recounted to reporters on Saturday. \u201cHe said, \u2018[Expletive] that!\u2019\u201d Duran leads all of MLB in triples this year (10), and it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll be slowing down any time soon. Cora praised the player\u2019s dedication to taking his game to the next level in 2024 after telling the humorous story. \u201cHe works so hard. He now understands what he needs to do to play every day, to keep his energy the way he should,\u201d Cora said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good stuff going on with him. The preparation is second to none. It\u2019s pregame and postgame. He goes 4-for-4, they sit down, and they break down the at-bats. \u2026 Same thing when he goes 0-for-4. \u2026 He\u2019s driving the ball now, hitting the ball all over the place. The at-bats are really good.\u201d Through Duran\u2019s 77 games, he\u2019s batting .280 with a .824 OPS. The 27-year-old has collected 88 total hits and has walked 30 times. His previous season-high for walks was 24 last year through 102 games, which shows he\u2019s increased his patience at the plate. It\u2019s paying off for himself personally, and for the whole team. Cora has high hopes that Duran will make this year\u2019s All-Star team. \u201cWe\u2019ll see in a month \u2014 that\u2019s gonna be fun, I believe,\u201d Cora said. \u201cThat Sunday when they announce the All-Stars is a special one and if this happens, it\u2019s gonna be great.", "summary": "<p>\u201cLast night, I called him into the office and said, \u2018Hey, you got an off day tomorrow.\u2019 He said, \u2018[Expletive] that!\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2024/06/22/red-sox-jarren-duran-alex-cora-day-off-joke-quotes/\">Alex Cora jokingly tried to give Jarren Duran his first day off in 2024.

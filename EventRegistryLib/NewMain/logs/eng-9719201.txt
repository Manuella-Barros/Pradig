As of July 15, consumers will no longer be able to write a check at Target.\n\nTarget cited \"extremely low volumes\" for the decision, which should not come as a surprise. According to 2022 data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, only 1% of all retail purchases were made via check. However, there are still areas where check writing makes sense.\n\nCheck usage has declined sharply in recent years, dropping from 18.1 billion checks written in 2015 to 11.2 billion checks in 2021, according to the Federal Reserve. Nevertheless, the overall value of check payments increased slightly from 2018 to 2021. While the number of check payments dropped, the average value of those payments rose from $1,908 in 2018 to $2,430 in 2021, totaling $27.23 trillion.\n\nCheck usage has become almost exclusively the payment of choice for high-dollar services, but not high-dollar goods, according to the Boston Fed report cited earlier. The report noted that \"while credit cards are typically accepted for large-value purchases (whether in person or online), large-value services often cannot be paid with a credit card, and consumers instead use checks to pay for those services.\"\n\nTo that end, the most popular use case for personal checks was paying contractors. The Boston Fed found that a plurality of contractor payments, or 43%, was still made by check. Charitable or religious donations, government fees, and rent were the other categories where check usage was still more popular than either debit cards or credit cards.\n\nMeanwhile, retail check payments have dropped to nearly zero, as the Target decision highlights. The Fed also found that paper check payments for hotels and transportation had declined from 9.3% and 6.5%, respectively, in 2017 to 0% in 2020.\n\nThe federal government remains another strong user of paper checks, with 23% of benefit recipients receiving assistance in the form of checks or vouchers. But even that may be diminishing. According to a study commissioned by Visa earlier this year, only 13% of the recipients prefer to get their funds that way.", "source": {"uri": "paymentsjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PaymentsJournal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_nawrocki@paymentsjournal.com", "name": "Tom Nawrocki", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whole Foods Market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voucher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voucher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Visa Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.paymentsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/check-issuing-concept_1426-1019.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719201", "eventUri": "eng-9719201", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 147, "textEnd": 154}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Cash-dispensing ATMs, debit cards, online banking and mobile payment systems like Venmo and Apple Pay mean many young adults may never have written a check.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCheck usage has been in decline for decades as Americans have largely switched to paying for their services with credit and debit cards. Americans wrote roughly 3.4 billion checks in 2022, down from nearly 19 billion checks in 1990, according to the Federal Reserve. However, the average size of the checks Americans wrote over the 32-year period rose from $673 in 1990 -- or $1,602 in today's dollars -- to $2,652.\n\nThe drop in check writing enabled the Federal Reserve to sharply reduce its national check processing infrastructure. In 2003, it ran 45 check-processing locations nationwide; since 2010, it has operated only one.\n\nRising incidents of check fraud are also making people shy away from check writing. It's being fueled by organized crime that is forcing small businesses and individuals to take additional safety protections or to avoid sending checks through the mail altogether.\n\nWalgreens will close a 'significant' number of its 8,600 US locations\n\nCEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that the store closures would make up a \"meaningful percent\" of the quarter-or-so locations that are underperforming.\n\nWhy McDonald's killed this menu item\n\nThe chain has concluded that when people go to McDonald's, they mostly want a burger and fries.\n\nDo US fast-food customers want plant-based meat?

Target said it remained committed to creating an easy and convenient checkout experience with credit and debit cards, \"buy now, pay later\" services and the Target Circle membership program, which applies deals automatically at checkout.\n\n\"We have taken several measures to notify guests in advance\" about the no-cheques policy, the company said.\n\nTarget's decision leaves Walmart, Macy's and Kohl's among the retailers that still accept personal cheques at their stores. Whole Foods Market and the Aldi supermarket chain previously stopped taking cheques from customers.\n\nShoppers have pulled out chequebooks increasingly less often since the mid-1990s. Cash-dispensing ATMs, debit cards, online banking and mobile payment systems like Venmo and Apple Pay mean many young adults may never have written a cheque.\n\nCheque usage has been in decline for decades as Americans have largely switched to paying for their services with credit and debit cards. Americans wrote roughly 3.4 billion cheques in 2022, down from nearly 19 billion cheques in 1990, according to the Federal Reserve. However, the average size of the cheques Americans wrote over the 32-year period rose from $673 in 1990 - or $1,602 in today's dollars - to $2,652.\n\nThe drop in cheque writing enabled the Federal Reserve to sharply reduce its national cheque processing infrastructure. In 2003, it ran 45 cheque-processing locations nationwide; since 2010, it has operated only one.\n\nRising incidents of cheque fraud are also making people shy away from cheque writing.

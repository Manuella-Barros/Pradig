A 10,000 US dollar bounty had initially been put on the eight to 10ft long monster after the attack and several beaches and coastal areas were closed, much like in the Speilberg classic, Jaws.\n\nDuring a press conference, Farley Augustine, Tobago's chief secretary revealed the unfortunate victim had been soaking up sun on holiday with his wife and pals and had initially planned to return home that very day.

As a result the species is now listed as vulnerable.\n\nBut Frankie stressed the importance of respecting them as part of the marine eco system and called for a better understanding in a bid to \"protect the balance of our marine food web.\"\n\nShe added: \"I have swum, snorkelled and dived with schools of sharks on numerous occasions all over the world - including bull sharks many times - and I can vouch for the awesomeness of these amazing animals up close.\n\n\"It is important to reiterate that shark attacks are extremely rare although highly hyped when they occur, for obvious reasons, which unfortunately gives sharks in general a very bad press.\n\n\"However, statistically the chances of being attacked by a shark are about as low as is possible in the scheme of things, with on average just five shark-caused deaths globally every year.\n\n\"In fact you are 30 times more likely to be killed by a falling coconut -

That's the view of marine biologist Zaheer Hosein.\n\nIn an interview at the UWI, St Augustine, Zoological Museum, last Thursday, Hosein said there is no evidence to suggest that shark attacks are increasing in frequency. He said in T&T's history there has been only one confirmed attack.\n\nReferring to an incident where a fisherman was bitten by a blacktip reef shark in Trinidad in February, Hosein said this was the only reported incident of a shark attack in T&T's waters before the incident at Turtle Beach in which British tourist Peter Smith, 64, was seriously injured.\n\n\"Sharks are by nature very curious animals, coupled with the fact that they are apex predators, they are not afraid of anything in the water. So what we may have seen in Tobago with this bull shark attack is the animal simply being curious. But we've never seen bull sharks coming this close to our shores,\" he said\n\nOne unverified incident believed to involve a shark was the death of 24-year-old Shaka Galera whose body was found in the Plum Mitan River in 2012.\n\nOn June 21, 2012, Galera, went on a fishing trip with a friend from Radix Village when he jumped out of the boat to swim. Three days later, his headless body, which appeared to have bite marks, was found.\n\nSharks have been known to enter large freshwater streams and even spawn at the mouths of rivers due to their physiology.\n\nDespite the seemingly random nature of the attack, a crusade against the animals was initiated, beginning with a $10,000 bounty from the Tobago House of Assembly (THA) for the shark's capture, which was later retracted.\n\nHowever, between Wednesday and Thursday, fishermen killed at least 12 sharks.\n\nHosein warned that such an excessive response against a vital part of T&T's marine ecosystem can endanger this country's fisheries.\n\nHe said bull sharks can grow up to 500 pounds and reach up to ten feet in length making them fearsome predators but their ecological contributions are too valuable to overlook.\n\nAs apex predators, sharks assist in regulating the populations of several species including commercial species of fish. A widespread elimination of sharks can allow fish populations to increase dramatically and while this might be seen as a benefit, it leads to older, sicker organisms being allowed to survive.\n\n\"They (sharks) help ensure not only the numbers of fish but also the genetic quality of the prey species,\" he said.\n\n\"In terms of fisheries, you're going to have an immediate boom of fish being caught because you no longer have top predators, however as time goes on you will see falls in prey populations. Those fishes our fishermen catch will be under threat if this culling continues.\"\n\nWhile leatherback turtles are one of the main prey items for sharks, Hosein says said are in no immediate threat.\n\nHe notes that sharks also regulate the genetic stock of the turtles, assisting in the overall population of the species.\n\n\"The only organisms that can take leatherback turtles are the large sharks like bull sharks and white sharks.\n\n\"An adult turtle should be able to escape from a bull shark, but the sharks tend to take the weak, sick, genetically poor, older individuals from the population.\"\n\nA 2023 study conducted by the Environmental Research Institute in Charlotteville (ERIC), Tobago, reported that shark populations in the Caribbean are declining.\n\nSharks belong to a species of fish called elasmobranchs which also include stingrays and sawfish. The species typically has cartilaginous bones rather than the long, pointy bones of other species.\n\nThe researchers used Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) and found that the rich diversity of shark species was high in northeast Tobago compared to other parts of the Caribbean.\n\nThe study found the diversity of sharks was \"unexpectedly high\" with several rare species like sharpnose, smoothhound, tiger, hammerhead and great hammerhead sharks recorded in their findings.\n\nHosein says male sharks usually reach sexual maturity at around 15 years, with female sharks maturing at an older age.\n\nHe says this further highlights the risk overfishing of sharks poses as reproductive rates may not be as high for other fish species.\n\nReferring to a small Marine Protected Area (MPA) spanning about seven square kilometres in southwest Tobago, researchers in the 2023 study said this area might be too small for effective shark conservation.", "source": {"uri": "cnc3.co.tt", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNC3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bull shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shark attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marine biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apex predator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tobago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacktip_reef_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blacktip reef shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trinidad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spawn (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leatherback_sea_turtle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leatherback sea turtle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turtle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fresh water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.cnc3.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/5254797.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542168", "eventUri": "eng-9542168", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-21", "textStart": 1148, "textEnd": 1161}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

who works at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University in New York - said this week that climate change could see sharks 'moving north'.\n\nHe said: \"Climate change is starting to impact where we find species and in some cases where we no longer find them.\n\n\"There are all these theories flying around about climate change and animals moving further north and animals living closer to shore, and therefore interacting with human beachgoers.\"\n\nHe said that climate change and coastal development could 'displace' animals, including sharks - meaning they are more likely to 'show up in other areas'.\n\nAsked about warmer waters in the UK, he said that the sea around us is 'changing really, really quickly...warming faster than other parts of the ocean'.\n\nHe added: \"We really do need to get a better handle on how climate change, especially warming, is going to impact the distribution and the survival of a lot of these animals.\"\n\nHe said, however, he didn't think warmer waters in the north would necessarily see more 'interactions' between sharks and humans or that sharks would get 'any closer to shore'.\n\nResearchers at Florida Museum, which has compiled a list of shark attacks around the world since 1580, found that the 'Big Three' - Great Whites, Bull and Tiger - were responsible for the most attacks on humans.\n\nA spokesman said: \"The white, tiger and bull sharks are the Big Three in the shark attack world.\n\n\"They are large species that are capable of inflicting serious injuries to a victim, are commonly found in areas where humans enter the water, and have teeth designed to shear rather than hold.\"\n\nStats show that bull sharks have bitten 119 humans in unprovoked attacks, 26 of them fatal.\n\nTiger sharks have bitten 142 folk, with 39 being fatal.\n\nGreat whites - like Jaws - are top of the list, with 351 recorded attacks on humans in the past 444 years, 59 of them fatal.\n\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stian_alexander@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Stian Alexander", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shark attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Shark_Attack_File", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Shark Attack File"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bull shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stony Brook University"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great white shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32728288.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Great-White-Shark-swimming-fast.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542168", "eventUri": "eng-9542168", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Reacting quickly, the internet community shared the footage of this strange occurrence at Hudson's Seafood extensively.\n\nAs soon as the video became viral on social media, several people expressed worries about the clients of the restaurant's safety. By providing everything that is currently known about this incident, this article seeks to remove the need for readers to search through numerous websites.\n\nThe video was purportedly taken after a charter returned to the restaurant's pier and dumped leftover garbage into the sea, which is what drew the sharks in. The sharks were seen swimming close to the restaurant after the fishing charter returned and the leftovers were disposed of.\n\nEven though the Town of Hilton Head had reported a shark attack the Friday before in the Sea Pines neighborhood, about ten miles down the coast, the clip was purportedly taken on Sunday.\n\nA man reported that he was swimming in waist-deep water when he was attacked by a shark. The Shore Beach Service had to seal off a portion of the beach after the victim reported that a shark had latched onto his foot. If a shark approaches you, keep eye contact and slowly back away, urges the International Shark Attack File, a comprehensive database of shark attacks.\n\nThe recommended course of action in the event of a shark bite is to try to repel the shark by focusing on its eyes, nose, and gills.

Led by Lindsay Mullins and her team, the study sees them meticulously tracking the bull shark population here, as they are one of the species who call this area home.\n\nBull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) inhabit warm, shallow coastal waters around the world, from tropical rivers to estuaries and open ocean environments. Known for their muscular build and blunt snouts, bull sharks possess a remarkable ability to regulate their internal salt levels; this allows them to venture far inland through rivers and estuaries. With a diverse diet ranging from fish and dolphins to birds and even other sharks, they play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. However, their propensity for coastal habitats also brings them into closer proximity to human activities, raising important questions about coexistence and conservation efforts.\n\nAnalyzing data spanning nearly two decades and 440 captures, Mullins and the team meticulously tracked changes in distribution and abundance, while also scrutinizing the environmental factors at play. From 2001 to 2020, the sea surface temperatures here climbed steadily, providing a hospitable environment for the burgeoning bull shark population. As Mobile Bay warmed by nearly half a degree Celsius, hovering at 23 degrees by 2020, the juvenile bull sharks thrived. Intriguingly, the researchers discovered a correlation between sea surface temperatures exceeding 22.5 degrees Celsius and the heightened presence of these sharks, signaling a possible connection between environmental conditions and species distribution. Over the study period, they found the number of juvenile bull sharks captured per hour increased fivefold; strikingly, these young sharks also seemed undeterred by the encroaching presence of urbanization along the coastline.\n\nBut as temperatures continue to climb, questions abound about what lies ahead for Mobile Bay's burgeoning bull shark population. How will the bull shark population respond to further warming? Could the increasing presence of bull sharks signal a shift in local fishing dynamics? Might heightened interactions between humans and sharks become more commonplace?\n\nThe authors caution against complacency in this matter, urging for officials to take a proactive approach to understanding what is happening and mitigating any potential risks. While the increasing abundance of bull sharks could herald benefits for coastal ecosystems - such as regulating fish populations - it may also poses numerous challenges for industries like fishing, where sharks may intercept catches, alter the behavior of targeted species, or escalate human-shark encounters. However, amidst these challenges lie opportunities for proactive conservation measures. The team advocates for a holistic mitigation approach - one that sees a marriage between science with engagement from the Mobile Bay community. The team hopes that by fostering a deeper understanding of the vital role bull sharks play in coastal ecosystems, the local fishing industry can navigate these changes with greater awareness and adaptability.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bull shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mudflat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Habitat destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aquatic plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crustacean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Estuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urbanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64f93e49c71fd2e1a773b636/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542168", "eventUri": "eng-9542168", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

He writes for The Tribune on what can be done to reduce the risk of shark attacks in our waters.\n\nMY name is Andr\u00e9 Musgrove. I'm a professional underwater photographer, shark diver, and spearfisherman from the Bahamas, and have extensive experience working with sharks and shark scientists worldwide, including Tiger Sharks, Bull Sharks, and Great White Sharks.\n\nMost shark feeding operations in The Bahamas feed the sharks one at a time at depth from a bait crate that a designated shark feeder controls, referred to as \"Controlled Feeding\". Shark-feeding dive operations in The Bahamas conduct scuba dives at specific spots, regularly using fish bait to attract sharks for observation.\n\nAccording to all local dive shops websites that do shark feed dives here in The Bahamas, they require guests to be certified scuba divers or be accompanied by a scuba instructor after doing an introductory scuba course to participate in any shark dives. They give dive safety briefings to all guests before dives and the dives are accompanied by safety divers. Most dives are conducted while scuba diving.\n\nSome foreign charter shark diving vessels have different requirements regarding safety protocol and optional dive safety briefings before dives. Every operator has different dive protocols and practices.\n\nSome operators use chumsicle feeding instead of controlled feeding which are essentially frozen buckets of chum attached to a line, and put in the water at depth for the sharks to eat freely. The local dive shops usually conduct one regular scheduled shark feed dives per day with more shark feed dives happening on rare occasions for special projects. The majority of foreign charter vessels that do shark dives are liveaboard style, conducting dives throughout the day at the designated shark feeding sites. Some participate in controlled feeding, while others introduce bait to attract sharks but do not directly feed them. The repeated schedule of introducing dead fish in the water at these specific locations has created well-established shark provisioning sites.\n\nThe fishing industry, comprising both commercial and recreational vessels, is widespread across our archipelago. From spearfishing to deep dropping, various fishing practices are employed, often resulting in fish blood and bait attracting sharks. Notably, areas frequented by fishers, particularly those where fish scraps are dis- carded, become hotspots for shark activity.\n\nSharks can get an easy meal from taking the fish off the lines or predating on an already bleeding fish in the reef from a bad spearfisher shot. These practices influence sharks to associate the sound of some boat engines, and persons in the water with food, in the areas the sharks have been able to get an easy meal, conditioning them to frequent these areas nationwide in search of an easy meal.\n\nThere are seven total well-established shark dive-feeding locations and two shark-provisioned dive sites in The Bahamas where shark dive operations frequent:\n\n* The Caribbean Reef Shark Site, Southwest New Providence.\n\n* Split Head Reef for Caribbean Reef Sharks, in Cape Eleuthera.\n\n* Austin Smith Wreck, North Exuma Cays.\n\n* The Oceanic Whitetip Shark Site, South Cat Island.\n\n* The two Provisioned Sites are South Andros Reef Shark Dive Site, Andros and Triangle Rocks, Bimini.\n\nCommercial and recreational fishing vessels in The Bahamas operate on nearly every inhabited island of the Bahamas engaging in different fishing practices, including spearfishing, compressor diving, bottom fishing, deep dropping, and high-speed trolling.\n\nAccording to the Global Shark Attack files, between 2018 and 2023, there have been a total of 24 reported shark bites with 21 being non-fatal and three fatal bites across The Bahamas. Looking at some of these bites based on activity and location:\n\nFive non-fatal bites occurred while spearfishing with four of the five bites happening all around the island of Abaco, which has a healthy population of fish and coral reef.\n\nFour bites total occurred while snorkeling with two being fatal. The two fatal bites occurred within less than two miles of each other with the one at Green Cay being a popular location where tour operators chum at the surface to attract sea turtles. These locations are on the north-eastern side of New Providence with the shark species involved rumoured to be Bull Sharks or Tiger Sharks.\n\nThree bites occurred while engaging in scuba diving activities with two of them occurring at popular shark diving sites, including Tiger Beach with a foreign operator. The other happened at Shark Junction where surface chumming was being con- ducted by a tour operator that does not conduct scuba diving trips.\n\nFour non-fatal bites occurred while swimming in the Exuma Cays in popular spots where persons swim with Nurse sharks in marinas where the sharks are chummed at the surface and fishers clean fish.\n\nDrawing connections between reported shark bites and popular shark feeding sites, fishing areas, and fish cleaning docks reveals potential correlations. For instance, the concentration of tour operators and fishers on the north-eastern side of New Providence coincides with increased shark activity in these waters.\n\nTo mitigate risks associated with shark encounters, proactive measures must be taken. Implementing fish depository stations at docks, where fish scraps can be disposed of in deep waters, could deter sharks from high-traffic human areas. Regulating surface chumming and enforcing stricter guidelines for shark dive operators are vital steps in ensuring safer waters. Surface chumming should be minimised or avoided altogether, depending on the location and species of sharks present. New regulations and public awareness efforts are necessary for establishing ocean chumming or feeding spots, preventing individuals from inadvertently entering areas with potential risks. Shark dive operators must employ highly experienced staff and adhere to strict requirements for in-water shark encounters, first aid, and safety protocols.\n\nWhile spearfishing, always be extremely vigilant before, during, and after shooting a fish, and always dive with a buddy who has a similar or better experience level as you spearfishing. Avoid spearing fish when sharks are visibly or knowingly in the area; taking that risk significantly increases the chance of a shark bite.\n\nI encourage The Bahamas government to enforce stricter rules for all shark dive operators and chumming based on science and the data history of what methods work safely to keep persons safer in the water. Any operators with a consistent history of negative shark incidents should undergo investigation, with solutions implemented to reduce future risks and or denial of operational permits.", "source":

Maggots were now scrambling for their lives from the hole into which I had pumped copious amounts of Negasunt powder, which would kill them.\n\nClaudia and I were waiting on the animal shelter van, which was taking what felt like aeons to arrive, to take this emergency case to the veterinary clinic.\n\nWho had allowed that once obviously majestic creature to get to his current state? For how long had he suffered before being dumped along the road that leads to Kilgwyn Bay?\n\nThat bay is one of Tobago's famous dumping grounds for dogs. We have rescued many from there and rehomed them.\n\nI write that while hoping that no one reading this is a \"dumper\" who will see my words as permission to drop off their unwanted \"cargo\" because they think, \"She/they will handle it.\"\n\nWhen I first encountered the pitbull that day, he was stumbling and weak. He lightly licked my hand and gave one faint wag of his long, hairless tail. I gave him some of the dog chow I had in my vehicle, but he was too weak to eat.\n\nBy the time Claudia (who lives nearby) arrived with the water I had called and asked her to bring, he had collapsed behind a lamppole, life, energy and blood draining from him.\n\nA man living up a track to the side of the pole appeared with a plastic bag of food and some water. He told us that he was accustomed to this; living there, he has seen so many dogs \"pass through\" (ie dumped).\n\nWhen the van finally arrived and took Murphy (as I called him) away, I called Dr Small, the TTSPCA clinic's head vet, and told her that if she assessed him as being able to make it, we would raise funds to cover the bills. If not deemed fit for survival, go ahead and euthanise.\n\nHaving seen the way the blood had poured from his side, I felt that the \"E word\" would have been the outcome. Dr Small's grave voice on the phone after her assessment confirmed my suspicions.\n\nI got home to news of English visitor Peter Smith, who had been attacked by a shark at Turtle Beach. I used the word \"attacked\" here simply to suggest that we should, in fact, not use that word in relation to incidents of sharks coming into contact with humans who are injured as a result.\n\nThis quote (re California Department of Fish and Wildlife) explains: \"CDFW uses the word 'incident' rather than terms like 'bite' or 'attack' which imply intent on the part of the shark to knowingly harm or consume a person. Most interactions where sharks bite people can be attributed to exploratory bites in which the shark is investigating an object in its environment, or incidents in which the shark mistakes a person for its natural food source.\"\n\nSharks, swimming in their habitat (the ocean), do not see human beings (not their habitat) and calculatingly think: \"Let me attack that human.\" The sharks are curious. They are doing what they do in their search for sustenance and survival.\n\nUnfortunately, that shark's exploration for sustenance included Mr Smith, to whom I extend wishes for a successful recovery - and comfort to his no-doubt traumatised loved ones.\n\nThe response of the THA (Tobago House of Assembly) in quickly issuing a $10,000 reward for the capture of the shark that encountered Mr Smith was, in my view, reactionary and environmentally irresponsible.\n\nWho knows how many sharks are in Tobago's waters?

There are nine populations of white sharks across the globe and OCEARCH's goal is to assist regional scientists to better understand the life of the white shark in each of these populations,\" the group's website states.\n\nOCEARCH was due to launch its 47th expedition on April 1 but canceled it due to delays in the repair and maintenance of its research vessel M/V OCEARCH, according to a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nInstead, scientists plan to head to Europe this summer for Expedition Save the Med.\n\nScientists plan to travel to Spain, France and Ireland aboard the research vessel M/V OCEARCH to study the Mediterranean Sea great white shark population. Expedition Save the Med is planned for July 29 to September 23.\n\n\"Ruthlessly persecuted. Completely misunderstood. Now critically endangered. OCEARCH is traveling over 4,000 miles to explore European waters and study the Mediterranean white shark population. A study of this kind has never been done before,\" the group posted on its website.\n\nWhile confirmed sightings of great white sharks in the Mediterranean are rare, OCEARCH says there have been some in the Bay of Biscay along the coasts of Spain and France. Unconfirmed but credible sightings have also been made off the UK coast, where researchers believe Mediterranean white sharks go to forage.\n\n\"Just one shark could begin to unlock the secrets of the Mediterranean white shark population and help us protect the region.\"\n\nAccording to its tracker, OCEARCH has tagged 371 sharks, including 123 great white sharks.\n\nThe group has also tagged alligators, dolphins, seals, swordfish and turtles.\n\nMake a donation to OCEARCH or fill out a registration form to be entered into the \"Meet a Shark\" sweepstakes and a chance to win a trip to Europe and a chance to \"meet\" a great white shark. No purchase is necessary, according to the official sweepstakes rules.\n\nThe sweepstakes started on May 1 and eligible entries must be received by 11:59 p.m. on August 5, 2024.\n\nEntrants must be 21 or older and legal residents of the United States, Canada (excluding Quebec), the UK or Ireland.\n\nWinners will be determined by random drawing. Official rules are available at meetashark.com.\n\nThe grand prize winner and a guest get a 5-day, 4-night trip to Spain, France or Ireland with airfare and hotel included and have a chance to join OCEARCH scientists on their research vessel during the shark-tagging Expedition Save the Med.\n\nAnd if you don't win the grand prize, there's still a chance at one of 100 prize packs that include

Sharks found in Nova Scotia have also been transported to the AVC for postmortem testing.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe white shark recovery proposal was under public review until April 20, with members of the public across Canada able to submit comments and suggestions regarding the recovery plan.\n\nThe department is now reviewing these public opinions and will tailor the recovery proposal as the plan moves forward, Crowell said.\n\nRecovery of the white sharks will take several decades, owing to the species' long life and slow reproductive rate.\n\nThe recovery plan will still take several years of research to come into effect, and researchers will continue to gather data and study the northeast Atlantic Canada white shark population.\n\n\"It's not one person's lifetime or career that will see recovery, it's a lot more long-term. It's nice to think it's a communal effort across industry and government and public,\" Crowell said.\n\nAnyone who encounters a shark in Atlantic Canada is encouraged to report the sighting to the DFO, and those curious about tagged sharks can observe tracking data from tagged white sharks online.\n\nCaitlin Coombes is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter, a position funded by the federal government.

It also doesn't help tarpon that they stick to 10-20 feet of water and are covered in bright reflective silvery scales which can be spotted in clear water by sharks seeing the reflection off the sun or sensing disturbances in the water through vibrations.\n\nTarpon fishing can be accomplished year-round in South Florida from Miami to the Florida Keys to the Florida Everglades and Marco Island but the rest of SW Florida heats up this time of year. There are already many videos of sharks going after tarpon before anglers can reel them into the boat and release the fish, videos like this one of a truly gargantuan hammerhead shark going after a tarpon right as it was reeled to the side of the boat:\n\nAnother video from 10kcharters out of Marco Island shows a tarpon getting destroyed by hungry sharks before it could be released:\n\nIt is worth mentioning that when tarpon fishing, if an angler is battling a fish and they spot a shark the guidance is to flip open the bail on the reel and allow the fish to swim freely so it can escape. Tarpon are already often exhausted from the battle with anglers but allowing them to swim freely is the least we as fishermen can do to keep the fisheries healthy.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, it's not just tarpon that sharks are devouring. This wahoo got crushed by sharks!\n\nFor anyone out there looking to catch their first tarpon, I'd recommend targeting Boca Grande, Sarasota, or Anna Maria Island this time of year. Or visiting Capt. Jimmy at Everglades Fishing Co. in Everglades City, Florida year-round because he can always put you on fish in that estuary where juvenile tarpon hang out before they're big enough to venture out into the Gulf of Mexico.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cass_anderson@brobible.com", "name": "Cass Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tarpon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Island,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Island, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marco Island, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Grande,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Grande, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boca Grande, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Maria_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Maria Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anna Maria Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everglades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerhead_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hammerhead shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Keys"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades_City,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everglades City, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Everglades City, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wahoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Estuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tarpon-fishing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542168", "eventUri": "eng-9542168", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

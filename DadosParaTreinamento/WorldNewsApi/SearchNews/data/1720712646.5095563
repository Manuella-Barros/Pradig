Is it good for the brain too? As you\u2019d expect, it is, in fact for \u201csuperior\u2019 brain health. Our food choices affect cognitive function and mental wellbeing in a profound way. Warwick University researchers looked at the dietary choices of a large sample of 181,990 people from the UK Biobank and compared them to a range of physical measurements, including cognitive function, blood metabolic biomarkers, brain imaging and genetics. An online questionnaire collected the food preferences of each of the participants which the team then categorised into 10 groups (such as alcohol, fruits and meats). The data revealed a balanced diet was associated with better mental health, superior cognitive functions and even higher amounts of grey matter in the brain \u2013 linked to intelligence \u2013 compared with those eating a less varied diet. If you\u2019re thinking of making changes, do it slowly by reducing sugar and fat intake over time, and people may find themselves naturally gravitating towards healthier food choices. Lead author, Professor Jianfeng Feng, of Warwick University, emphasised the importance of establishing healthy food preferences early in life. He said: \u201cDeveloping a healthy balanced diet from an early age is crucial for healthy growth. To foster the development of a healthy balanced diet, both families and schools should offer a diverse range of nutritious meals and cultivate an environment that supports their physical and mental health.\u201d Addressing the broader implications of the research, Prof Feng emphasised the role of public policy in promoting accessible and affordable healthy eating options. \u201cSince dietary choices can be influenced by socioeconomic status, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that this does not hinder individuals from adopting a healthy balanced dietary profile,\u201d he stated. \u201cImplementing affordable nutritious food policies is essential for governments to empower the general public to make informed and healthier dietary choices, thereby promoting overall public health.\u201d Dr Richard Pemberton, certified lifestyle physician and GP, Hexagon Health, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, is enthusiastic. \u201cThis exciting research further demonstrates that eating a poor diet detrimentally impacts not only our physical health but also our mental and brain health,\u201d he said. \u201cThis study supports the need for urgent government action to optimise health in our children, protecting future generations. \u201cWe also hope this provides further evidence to motivate us all to make better lifestyle choices, to improve our health and reduce the risk of -developing chronic disease.\u201d", "summary": "Warwick University researchers looked at the dietary choices of a large sample of 181,990 people from the UK Biobank and compared them to a range of physical measurements, including cognitive function, blood metabolic biomarkers, brain imaging and genetics", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/balanced-diet-leads-better-mental-32993082", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32993087.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_fun-family-mealtime.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:04:41", "author": "Miriam Stoppard,Miriam-Stoppard", "authors": ["Miriam Stoppard", "Miriam-Stoppard"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.515}

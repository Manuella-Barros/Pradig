Where will they take the country? No matter what skin colour we have, we are the people who worship Lord Krishna...,\" he said.\n\nFollowing Congress leader Sam Pitroda's \"racist remarks\" that stoked a massive row, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that the people of the country will not tolerate insults on the basis of the colour of the skin. Addressing a rally in Warangal, PM Modi demanded an answer from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.\n\n'Shehzade aapko jawaab dena padega'. My country will not tolerate the disrespect of my countrymen on the basis of their skin colour and Modi will never tolerate this...\" he said. PM Modi said, \"I was thinking a lot that (President) Droupadi Murmu who has a very good reputation and is the daughter of Adivasi family, then why is Congress trying so hard to defeat her but today I got to know the reason. I got to know that there is an uncle in America who is the philosophical guide of 'Shehzada' and just like the third umpire in cricket this 'Shehzada' takes advice from the third umpire.\n\n\"This philosophical uncle said that those who have black skin are from Africa. This means that you are abusing several people of the country on the basis of their skin colour...\" the Prime Minister said. \"... Where will they take the country? No matter what skin colour we have, we are the people who worship Lord Krishna...,\" he said.\n\nChairman of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda ignited a firestorm while speaking on the diversity of India referring to how people in the South \"look like Africans and those in the East look like Arabs and those in the East look like Chinese.\" Pitroda, in an interview to 'The Statesman', while reflecting upon the democracy in India said,\n\n\"We have survived 75 years in a very happy environment where people could live together, leaving aside a few fights here and there. We could hold a country together as diverse as India, where people in East look like Chinese, people in West look like Arab, people in the North look like white, and maybe people in South look like Africans.\" Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh posted on X to say that the analogies drawn by Pitroda in a podcast to illustrate India's diversity are \"most unfortunate and unacceptable.\"\n\n\"The Indian National Congress completely dissociates itself from these analogies\" he said. Earlier too, Pitroda had stoked a controversy while speaking about the concept of inheritance tax prevailing in America stating that such issues need to be discussed.\n\n\"In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has 100 million USD worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer 45 per cent to his children, 55 per cent is grabbed by the government. That's an interesting law. It says you in your generation, made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair,\" Pitroda had said. He had later sought to downplay the issue saying he had only cited inheritance tax in the US as an example. Congress officially distanced itself from Pitroda's comments saying that they did not reflect the view of the party at all times\n\nMeanwhile, PM Modi in Warangal stepping up his attacks on Congress, came down heavily on the party for making fake promises to the farmers and said, \"Nobody knows it better than Telangana how Congress deceives people. Congress had promised to waive off farm loans. Now they are delaying it until the Lok Sabha elections are over so that they can keep that promise hanging in mid-air. They swear on our Gods to keep their promises, while on the other hand, they demean Sanatana Dharma...\" The Prime Minister also targeted the Congress party for its formula of a new Prime Minister every year.\n\nHe said, \"No one can forget the sins of the Congress central government of 10 years ago. Every few days, a scam worth thousands of crores of rupees came to light. There were serial bomb blasts in big cities of the country... This time INDI alliance has come up with a formula of five years five PM. Just imagine what will happen to the country if they get power. Every year there is a new PM, second year, second PM, third year, and third PM? What good can they do for the country...\" Putting forward the ideology of Viksit India, the PM said, \"Today in front of you all is the dream of 'Viksit India' and 'Viksit Telangana'... There is instability, unrest and crisis everywhere in the world. In such a situation, can the command of the country be given to the wrong hands? This is why the country is saying 'Phir ek baar, Modi sarkaar'...\"\n\nThe PM also said, \"Two things have become clear after the third phase of elections, first: The public is taking NDA's 'Vijay Rath' forward at a fast pace. Second, Congress is searching their seats with magnifying glasses.\" He added, \"After seeing your enthusiasm in Telangana, today I can say one more thing, Congress's usual magnifying glass will not be sufficient to find their seats in the fourth phase. Congress will have to use a microscope to find its seats...\"\n\nMeanwhile, the PM also took to his official X handle and tweeted about his visit to Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam. He tweeted, \"This morning at Vemulawada, I prayed at the Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam. As the MP from Kashi, the connection with this Temple felt even greater. I prayed for the good health and prosperity of my fellow 140 crore Indians.\" (ANI)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

He added that for the Congress party, people who have black skin colour must be from Africa, and based on her skin colour, they assumed Droupadi Murmu was also African.

We could hold a country together as diverse as India, where people in the East look like Chinese, people in the West look like Arab, people in the North look like white and maybe people in the South look like Africans.\"\n\nHe further added that the people of India respect different languages, religions, food and customs which vary from region to region. \"That's the India that I believe in, where everybody has a place and everybody compromises a little bit,\" he said.\n\nJairam Ramesh said that the analogies drawn by Sam Pitroda are \"most unfortunate and unacceptable\".\n\n\"The analogies drawn by Sam Pitroda in a podcast to illustrate India's diversity are most unfortunate and unacceptable.

The Indian National Congress completely dissociates itself from these analogies.\" This came after the Bharatiya Janata Party earlier in the day attacked the Congress and Pitroda over his \"racist and divisive\" remarks. Later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also hit out at the party over Pitroda's comments at a poll rally in Warangal, Telangana.\n\nWhile addressing the rally, PM Modi demanded answers from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. \"Shehzade[Gandhi]...you will have to answer. My country will not tolerate the disrespect of my countrymen on the basis of their skin colour,\" he said. PM Modi also alleged that the Congress was against President Droupadi Murmu because of her skin color. \"Why was Congress trying so hard to defeat her?

If one has $100 million...when he dies he can only transfer probably 45% to his children, 55% is grabbed by the government.\" \"In India, you don't have that. If somebody is worth 10 billion and he dies, his children get 10 billion and the public gets nothing,\" he added.\n\nPitroda's remarks came in response to PM Modi's speech that the Congress manifesto promises to redistribute wealth among \"infiltrators\" and \"those with more children\" if it comes to power. To be sure, the Congress manifesto calls for a national socioeconomic and caste census to lay the groundwork for affirmative action.

''Who gave the permission to 'shehzada' for this game of skin colour,'' he asked while addressing an election rally at Warangal in the state.\n\nPitroda's comments that people in the eastern parts of the country resembled the Chinese, while those from the south looked like Africans, had kicked up a row.\n\n''I am angry today. If anyone abuses me, I don't get angry. I can tolerate that. But, the philosopher of 'shehzada' gave such a big abuse which has filled me with anger,'' Modi said.\n\nReferring to Rahul Gandhi showing Constitution in his election rallies, he asked whether those who dance by keeping Constitution on their head were insulting the countrymen on the basis of skin colour.\n\nIndia would not tolerate insult to the countrymen on the basis of skin colour, he said, adding that the ''shehzade'' (Rahul Gandhi) must answer.\n\nModi also said he has now come to know as to why Congress had sought to defeat Murmu in the presidential elections in 2022 despite her having a great reputation.\n\n''I came to know today that an uncle of 'shehzada' lives in America. The uncle is his philosopher and guide,'' he said in an apparent reference to Sam Pitroda.\n\n''Shehzada's philosopher and guide uncle has opened a big secret. He said those whose skin colour is dark, they are all from Africa,'' he said.\n\nThat means, he (Pitroda) has abused so many people of the country on the basis of skin colour, he alleged.\n\nWhatever is the colour of skin, the countrymen worship Lord Sri Krishna whose skin colour was like all of us, Modi said.\n\nEarlier, at Vemulavada in Karimnagar, Modi attacked Congress over the ''Ambani-Adani'' issue, demanding that the party explain to people why it has stopped raising the matter. ''Congress' 'Shehzada' used to do this for the past five years,'' Modi said, and asked if the party has struck a ''deal''.\n\n''Ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. I want to ask from Telangana soil, let the Shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani. Has tempo loads of notes (currency) reached the Congress? What deal has been arrived at, that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight,'' he asked.\n\n''Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot). You have to answer the nation,'' the Prime Minister said.\n\nThe Congress has been attacking the Modi government, accusing the Prime Minister of favouring the top five industrialists in the country, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani.\n\nAddressing the rally after the third phase of general elections (May 7), Modi also said the phase has ''blown the third fuse'' of Congress and its INDI Alliance. Congress leaders were searching for seats using magnifying glass after the latest round of polling, he claimed. The BJP and NDA were marching toward victory, he added.\n\nAttacking the Congress and K Chandrasekhar Rao-led BRS in Telangana, Modi said while the BJP believes in the 'nation first' principle, for the two parties it is ''family first''.\n\nThe BRS and Congress openly criticise each other on corruption, but it is a common factor between these parties, he charged.\n\nTaking a veiled swipe at Rahul Gandhi and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, he said there is a lot of discussion up to Delhi on the ''double R (RR)'' tax in the state. ''One R loots Telangana and then gives to the other R in Delhi,'' he said, adding the 'RR game'' would destroy the state.\n\nHe also claimed Congress will do away with reservation for SC/ST and OBCs and give it to Muslims. Modi also alleged that the Congress is not happy with the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya.\n\n''Do you know the intentions of the Congress party? Are you happy with Ram temple? Did you feel happy or not? But, Congress is unhappy and angry. The Congress party wants to put a lock in the Ram temple. This revelation was made by the former adviser of the royal family of Congress,'' he said.\n\nHe quoted the adviser as having said that the Congress ''shehzada'' was planning to stop the construction of Ram temple by reversing the court's decision.\n\nModi alleged that the ''shehzada'' said in a meeting with his confidantes that if Congress came to power, it will ''reverse the court's decision''.\n\nModi further alleged that Congress had ''insulted'' former PM P V Narasimha Rao (a son of the soil of Telangana) due to its ''family first'' policy.\n\nCongress did not allow Narasimha Rao's mortal remains into the party's office after his death, he alleged. It was the NDA government that honoured Narasimha Rao with Bharat Ratna award, he said.\n\nHe also said he had the opportunity to meet Narasimha Rao's family members on Tuesday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Pitroda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Pitroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droupadi_Murmu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Droupadi Murmu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warangal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krishna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karimnagar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karimnagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karimnagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanth_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revanth Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Narasimha_Rao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

Modi will never tolerate this,\" he said.\n\nModi also hinted that the Congress tried to defeat President Droupadi Murmu because of her skin colour. \"I was thinking a lot about (President) Droupadi Murmu, who has a very good reputation and is the daughter of the Adivasi family. Why was Congress trying so hard to defeat her? Today I got to know the reason,\" he added.\n\nThe Congress distanced itself from Pitroda's comments. \"The analogies given by Mr Sam Pitroda in a recent podcast to illustrate India's diversity are most unfortunate and completely unacceptable. The Indian National Congress rejects these analogies,\" Ramesh said. But a section of the Congress maintained that the damage has already been done. \"The Congress had set the narrative on the basis of its 25 guarantees and was trying to expose the PM's lies. But now, the BJP got fresh ammo against us,\" said a Congress leader, requesting anonymity.\n\nAt the rally in Warangal, Modi referred to Pitroda as an American uncle. \"I got to know that there is an uncle in America who is the philosophical guide of shehzada and just like the third umpire in cricket, this shehzada takes advice from the third umpire. This philosophical uncle said that those who have black skin are from Africa. This means that you are abusing several people of the country on the basis of their skin colour,\" he added.\n\nAt another rally in Rajampet, Modi criticised the Congress's \"divisive mindset,\" and asked if key ally Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) will snap ties for Tamil culture and pride.\n\n\"A big leader has displayed the divisive mindset of Congress. What the man very close to Gandhi family and the biggest advisor of shehzada said is very shameful,\" Modi said, in a reference to Pitroda's comments.\n\n\"Congress feels those in north eastern India look like Chinese. Can the country accept things like this? Congress feels people in the south look like Africans, will they accept this,\" he asked.\n\nHe asked the Congress chief ministers of Karnataka and Telangana, Siddaramaiah and Revanth Reddy, respectively, if they would accept \"such an accusation\". He asked if Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, \"who speaks of Tamil culture\", would sever the alliance.\n\n\"Such a serious allegation has been made - will DMK snap ties with Congress, for Tamil pride and the Tamil people? Do they have the guts?\" he asked.\n\nSanjay Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP from the Aam Aadmi Party, that is also part of the INDIA bloc, said none of the members of the opposition grouping will support Pitroda remarks. \"None of the INDIA bloc members support his statement,\" he told PTI Videos.\n\nTo be sure, Pitroda is no stranger to controversies. During the 2019 elections, Pitroda's comments on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots became a talking point for the BJP. In May 2019, when asked about the riots, Pitroda angrily retorted, \"Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye. '84 mein hua to hua... (What about 1984 [riots] now? Talk about what you (the government) did in the last five years. What happened in 1984 has happened).\"\n\nLast month, in the middle of the poll campaign, Pitroda spoke about the importance of inheritance tax, which the BJP then used to attack the Congress.\n\nIn another podcast, Chicago-based Pitroda said, \"In America, there is an inheritance tax. So, if, let's say, one has $100 million worth of wealth, and when he dies, he can only transfer probably 45% to his children, the government grabs 55%. That's an interesting law. It says you in your generation, made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair. In India, you don't have that. If somebody is worth 10 billion and he dies, his children get 10 billion and the public gets nothing... So, these are the kinds of issues people will have to debate and discuss.\"\n\nThe Congress distanced itself from Pitroda's comments and said it had no intention of introducing such a tax, but added that it was the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government which had abolished the Estate Duty Tax, which existed for 32 years, in 1985, and that it was in fact, BJP leaders that had advocated for it over the past decade. But that didn't stop Modi, or other BJP leaders, from alleging that the Opposition party intended to reintroduce the inheritance tax, redistribute the benefits of reservation and wealth to Muslims, and prevent \"hard earned wealth from passing down to children\".", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Pitroda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Pitroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droupadi_Murmu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Droupadi Murmu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairam_Ramesh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jairam Ramesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Statesman_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Statesman (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_umpire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third umpire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warangal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adivasi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adivasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament,_Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamils", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanth_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revanth Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._K._Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M.

Congress' 'Shehzada' used to do for the past five years, Modi said and asked if the party has struck a 'deal'.\n\nHave \"tempo loads of notes (money)\" reached the Congress that it has stopped targeting \"Ambani-Adani',\" Modi asked.\n\n\"Ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani.

What deal has been arrived at, that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight,\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot). You have to answer the nation,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\nThe Congress has been attacking the Modi government, accusing the Prime Minister of favouring the top five industrialists in the country, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani.\n\nAddressing the rally after the third phase of general elections (May 7), Modi also said the phase has blown the third 'fuse' of Congress and its INDI Alliance. Congress leaders were searching for seats using magnifying glass after the latest round of polling.\n\nIn fourth phase, they will have to use microscope, he said.\n\nHe added four phases of polling are left and with the blessings of the people, the BJP and NDA were marching toward victory.\n\nAttacking the Congress and K Chandrasekhar Rao-led BRS in Telangana, Modi said while the BJP believes in the 'nation first' principle, for the two parties it is 'family first'.\n\nThe BRS and Congress openly criticise each other on corruption, but it is a common factor between these parties, he charged.\n\nTaking a veiled swipe at Rahul Gandhi and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, he said there is a lot of discussion up to Delhi on the \"double R (RR)\" tax in the state.

Modi accused Pitroda of insulting Indians based on skin color and questioned Gandhi's motives. Modi also raised the \"Ambani-Adani\" issue, accusing Congress of abruptly halting its attacks on the industrialists, implying a deal. Modi predicted victory for BJP and NDA in the upcoming elections, claiming Congress and its INDI Alliance have been weakened. He criticized Congress and BRS for prioritizing family over the nation and alleged corruption within both parties.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday attacked the Congress over its party leader Sam Pitroda's comments over skin colour and asserted that the countrymen would not tolerate insult on the basis of skin colour.\n\nHitting out at top Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Modi said he has now understood that the national party sought to defeat President Droupadi Murmu in the presidential poll as her ''skin colour is dark''.\n\nAs Pitroda's reported comments kicked up a row, Modi asked, ''will the ability of people be decided in my country on the basis of skin colour.'' ''Who gave the permission to 'shehzada' for this game of skin colour,'' he asked while addressing an election rally at Warangal in the state.\n\nPitroda's comments that people in the Eastern parts of the country resembled the Chinese, while those from the South looked like Africans, had kicked up a row.\n\n''I am angry today. If anyone abuses me, I don't get angry. I can tolerate that. But, the philosopher of 'shehzada' gave such a big abuse which has filled me with anger,'' Modi said.\n\nReferring to Rahul Gandhi showing Constitution in his election rallies, he asked whether those who dance by keeping Constitution on their head were insulting the countrymen on the basis of skin colour.\n\nIndia would not tolerate insult to the countrymen on the basis of skin colour, he said, adding 'shehzade' (Rahul Gandhi) must answer.\n\nModi also said he has now come to know as to why Congress had sought to defeat Murmu in the presidential elections in 2022 despite her having a great reputation.\n\n''I came to know today that an uncle of 'shehzada' lives in America. The uncle is his philosopher and guide,'' he said in an apparent reference to Sam Pitroda.\n\n''Shehzada's philosopher and guide uncle has opened a big secret. He said those whose skin colour is dark, they are all from Africa,'' he said.\n\nThat means, he (Pitroda) has abused so many people of the country on the basis of skin colour, he alleged.\n\nWhatever is the colour of skin, the countrymen worship Lord Sri Krishna whose skin colour was like all of us, Modi said. Earlier, at Vemulavada in Karimnagar, Modi attacked Congress over the ''Ambani-Adani'' issue, demanding that the party explain to people why it has stopped raising the matter. Congress' 'Shehzada' used to do for the past five years, Modi said and asked if the party has struck a 'deal'.\n\nHave ''tempo loads of notes (money)'' reached the Congress that it has stopped targeting ''Ambani-Adani','' Modi asked.\n\n''Ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. I want to ask from Telangana soil, let the Shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani. Has tempo loads of notes (currency) reached the Congress? What deal has been arrived at, that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight,'' he asked.\n\n''Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot). You have to answer the nation,'' the Prime Minister said.\n\nThe Congress has been attacking the Modi government, accusing the Prime Minister of favouring the top five industrialists in the country, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani.\n\nAddressing the rally after the third phase of general elections (May 7), Modi also said the phase has blown the third 'fuse' of Congress and its INDI Alliance. Congress leaders were searching for seats using magnifying glass after the latest round of polling.\n\nIn fourth phase, they will have to use microscope, he said.\n\nHe added four phases of polling are left and with the blessings of the people, the BJP and NDA were marching toward victory.\n\nAttacking the Congress and K Chandrasekhar Rao-led BRS in Telangana, Modi said while the BJP believes in the 'nation first' principle, for the two parties it is 'family first'.\n\nThe BRS and Congress openly criticise each other on corruption, but it is a common factor between these parties, he charged.\n\nTaking a veiled swipe at Rahul Gandhi and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, he said there is a lot of discussion up to Delhi on the ''double R (RR)'' tax in the state. He also claimed Congress will do away with reservation for SC/ST and OBCs and give it to Muslims.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

Close on the heels of his inheritance tax analogy, much to the embarrassment of his party, he has now pontificated on how \"we have held a country together, as diverse as India, where people in the east look like the Chinese, people in the West look like the Arab, people in the North look like Whites and maybe people in the South look like Africans.\"\n\nEven as Pitroda squinted through coloured glasses, PM Narendra Modi and others in the BJP lost no time in latching onto the remarks and ran him down and his entire party as \"racist\". Pitroda made these remarks in an interview to 'The Statesman', after premising that \"we have survived 75 years in a very happy environment where people could live together, leave aside a few fights here and there.\"\n\nTaking on the Congress leadership at a rally in Warangal in Telangana, PM Modi, his words dripping with sarcasm, described Pitroda, who is the chairperson of the Indian Overseas Congress, as Rahul Gandhi's \"uncle, guide and philosopher\" who resides in the United States.\n\nStretching the analogy, Modi said he had learnt that \"there is an uncle in America who is the philosophical guide of 'Shehzada' (a moniker he often uses for Gandhi)\" and from whom he takes advice as if \"from the third umpire\". He added that \"such an insult on the basis of skin colour\" amounted to abusing the people of the country.\n\nThe Prime Minister also attacked Pitroda for suggesting that \"those who are black (in colour) are from Africa\". He argued that \"this means that you are abusing several people in the country on the basis of their skin colour.\"\n\nModi then dwelt on how traditionally people of darker skin colour have been revered in the country. \"As your PM and one of you, I affirm that we are all children of Lord Shri Krishna, and we are all equal, regardless of race or creed,\" he added.\n\nTo buttress his contention, he cited the case of Droupadi Murmu whom the Congress had opposed, when she was nominated for the post of President, because of her skin colour. \"Now I realise that they indeed believed that Droupadi Murmu is also African and because her skin colour is black, she should be defeated,\" he was quoted as saying. Modi said most countrymen have black skin. He reminded that Lord Krishna's colour was blue and black.\n\n\"I can tolerate it when abuses are hurled at me, but not when they are hurled at my people. We will not accept this racist mentality,\" the prime minister said.\n\nAs regards the Congress belief that the people of western India resemble Arabs, he asked if this notion was acceptable to Uddhav Thakarey and the people of Maharashtra.\n\n\"Congress divided India for power and it has now stooped to the level of making racial comments about Indians. What has happened to the Congress,\" he asked the gathering.\n\nAs BJP leaders rushed in to attack, the Congress distanced itself from the comments. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh tweeted on X that \"the analogies given by Sam Pitroda about India's diversity are extremely wrong and unacceptable. The Indian National Congress completely disassociates itself from these analogies.\"\n\nAssam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma ridiculed the stereotype being sought to be reinforced, by posting on X, \"Sam bhai, I am from the North-East, and I look like an Indian. We are a diverse country - we may look different, but we are all one.\"\n\nManipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh also remarked that the Congress has a hidden agenda to divide the country on religious lines and asked \"how can he (Pitroda) make such a racist comment?\"\n\nTerming the comments as \"very irresponsible\", he asserted that the Congress has been taking recourse to a \"divide and rule policy\" for some time. He said he would \"consult legal experts\" to see if Pitroda could be sued for his comments.\n\nActor-turned-politician and BJP candidate from Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, Kangana Ranaut, described the comments of Pitroda as \"racist and a divisive jibe for Indians\". She added that it was \"sickening to call fellow Indians Chinese and African.\"\n\nUnion Minister Kiren Rijuju was quoted as saying. \"We should not take Sam Pitroda's statement lightly.... What Pitroda thinks and says is what the Congress party is actually saying. Pitroda has a foreign mindset. His ideas and thinking are very alien to the Indian system and culture, and that is what Rahul Gandhi is also all about.\"", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free

Commenting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'redistribution of wealth remark' Pitroda said, \"If one has $100 million worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer probably 45 per cent to his children, 55 per cent is grabbed by the government. That's an interesting law. It says you, in your generation, made wealth, and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair.\" \"In India, we do not have such provisions. If an individual is worth 10 billion and passes away, their children inherit the entire sum, leaving nothing for the public... These are the discussions and debates that people will need to engage in,\" he added. Ram Mandir Construction: At an event in the US, Pitroda made headlines by asserting that discussions in India rarely touch upon crucial issues such as inflation, employment, and education. Instead, he remarked, the discourse tends to revolve around religious themes like Ram, Hanuman, and Mandir. \"When the entire nation is hung up on Ram Temple and Ram Janmabhoomi, it bothers me...To me, religion is something very personal, and national issues are education, employment, growth, the economy, inflation, health, the environment, and pollution. But no one speaks about it,\" he had said.Middle Class People Should Not Be 'Selfish': Pitroda had left the Congress party in a soup in April 2019 by sayinng that the middle class should pay more taxes to guarantee a minimum income for poor households, asking them not to be 'selfish'. Pulama: In Feb 2019, Pitroda had sparked a heated debate with his remarks on Pulwama attack.He had said,\"I don't know much about attacks. It happens all the time. The attack happened in Mumbai, also. We could have then reacted and just sent our planes, but that is not the right approach. According to me, that's not how you deal with the world.\"1984 Sikh Riots: During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when the BJP claimed that \"instructions\" for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots came from Rajiv Gandhi, Pitroda denied the charge but had said, \"Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye. '84 mein hua to hua. Aapne kya kiya?\"\n\nPM Modi Lambasts 'Shehzade's Philosopher'\n\nReacting strongly to Sam Pitroda's racist slur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lambasted Rahul Gandhi and said India will not tolerate this insult. 'I want to ask a serious question today...I am very angry today, if someone abuses me I can take it but this philosopher of 'Shehzada' has given such a big abuse that has filled me with anger. Will the potential of the people of the country be decided on the skin colour? asked PM Modi while addressing a public gathering in Warangal, Telangana.\n\nLaunching a scathing attack on Rahul, PM Modi further said, \"Who gave this right to 'Shehzada'? The people dancing with the Consitution on their heads are insulting my countrymen on the basis of their skin colour. Shehzade aapko jawaab dena padega'. My country will not tolerate the disrespect of my countrymen on the basis of their skin colour and Modi will never tolerate this.\"\n\nComparing Pitroda with the third umpire in cricket, PM Modi asserted,\"I got to know that there is an uncle in America who is the philosophical guide of 'Shehzada' and just like the third umpire in cricket this 'Shehzada' takes advice from the third umpire.\"\n\nUpping the ante further, PM Modi said, \"I was thinking a lot that Droupadi Murmu who has a very good reputation and is the daughter of the Adiwasi (tribal) family, then why is Congress trying so hard to defeat her but today I got to know the reason. This philosophical uncle said that those who have black skin are from Africa. This means that you are abusing several people of the country on the basis of their skin colour...\", PM Modi said.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic

(Image: X/@narendramodi)\n\nTearing into the Congress over its senior leader Sam Pitroda's fresh remarks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday demanded a response from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying that the country \"won't tolerate disrespect on the basis of the colour of skin\".\n\nPitroda, whose remark on an inheritance tax in the US last month made the BJP to see red, came up with a new controversial statement while he was trying to make a pitch for national unity despite India's diversity.\n\nIn an interview with The Statesman, Pitroda described India as a \"... diverse country... where people in the East look like Chinese, people in West look like Arabs, people in North look like maybe White and people in South look like Africans\".\n\nAs videos of Pitroda's remarks started doing the rounds on social media, PM Modi launched an all-out attack on the Congress at a rally in Telangana's Warangal.\n\nAlso Read: Sam Pitroda stokes row over 'people in East look like Chinese, South look like Africans' remark\n\nRepeating his \"shehzade (prince)\" barb for Rahul Gandhi, the Prime Minister said, \"Shehzade, you will have to answer. The country will not tolerate the disrespect of our countrymen on the basis of the colour of skin. Modi will definitely not tolerate it.\"\n\nDoubling down, the Prime Minister said he now knows why the Congress opposed the BJP's choice of Droupadi Murmu for the President's post. \"I used to wonder why the Congress opposed Droupadi Murmu's candidature in the presidential election, but I could not understand. But now I know why they tried to defeat Droupadi Murmu, an adivasi. An uncle of the shehzaada stays in the US. He is his philosopher and guide. He has said those who have dark skin are from Africa. Now I have understood, they also thought Droupadi Murmu is African. They thought her skin is dark, so she must be defeated,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\nOn his X handle as well, the Prime Minister said he was \"absolutely disgusted by the remarks of the senior Congress leader, who is the friend, philosopher and guide of the Congress' Crown Prince\". \"His remarks are racist and in very poor taste,\" the Prime Minister tweeted.\n\nAlso Read: 'Dangerous problems disguised as solutions': PM Modi on the idea of Inheritance Tax in India\n\nAmong the other BJP leaders who panned the remarks was Assam Chief Minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, who said, \"Sam bhai, I am from the northeast, and I look like an Indian. We are a diverse country - we may look different, but we are all one. Hamare desh ke bare mein thoda to samajh lo! (Please understand at least something about our country).\"\n\n\"I condemn Congress leader, Sam Pitroida's racist comment against the people of Northeast. The Congress has always tried to divide India with their Divide and Rule policy. But they must know that NE has been a part of India and will always be. Such a mockery in the India's diversity is highly unacceptable @INCIndia and @sampitroda must publicly apologize,\" Manipur CM N Biren Singh said.\n\nBJP leaders started an 'I look Indian' campaign to corner Congress over Pitroda's statement.\n\nAs BJP leaders slammed Pitroda and Congress, the party pushed into firefight mode and distanced itself from its senior leader's remark. \"The analogies drawn by Mr. Sam Pitroda in a podcast to illustrate India's diversity are most unfortunate and unacceptable. The Indian National Congress completely dissociates itself from these analogies,\" senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType":

Racially we have never differentiated the people of India. This is unwarranted and we are not for it. This (remark) is not ours, we talk about linguistic and cultural equality and that people living in all the states should treated equally.

At an election rally, Modi said: \"Now I understand why the Congress keeps insulting President Droupadi Murmu... just because she is dark-skinned.\"\n\nPitroda, an advisor to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, had said: \"We have survived 75 years in a very happy environment where people could live together, leaving aside a few fights here and there. We could hold the country as diverse as India together. Where people in the east look like the Chinese, people in the west look like the Arabs, people in the north look like, maybe, white and people in the south look like Africans.\"\n\nThe Congress immediately distanced itself from Pitroda's statement with the party's media cell in-charge Jairam Ramesh saying: \"The analogies drawn by Pitroda to illustrate India's diversity are most unfortunate and completely unacceptable. The Indian National Congress completely disassociates itself from these analogies and comments.\" Within the hour, the Congress announced that Pitroda had stepped down as chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress.\n\nBut the PM had already lapped it up. Speaking at a campaign rally in Rajampet of Andhra Pradesh, the PM said, \"I do not get angry if someone abuses me. Today, the philosopher of 'Shehzada' (prince) has inflicted such a big abuse that I am full of anger. Will people's abilities in our country be decided by the colour of their skin? Who has allowed the Shehzada to play this game of skin?\n\nTie-breaker\n\nAttacking the \"divisive\" mind of the Congress, Modi also wondered if a key ally of the national party, the DMK, will snap ties with Congress on Pitroda hurting Tamil culture and pride. Similarly, he also sought to know from Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh CMs if this unpardonable remark was acceptable to them.\n\n\"A big leader has displayed the divisive mindset of Congress. What the man very close to the Gandhi family and the biggest advisor of Shehzada said is very shameful,\" Modi emphasised.\n\n\"Congress feels those in north eastern India look like Chinese. Can the country accept things like this? Congress feels people in the south look like Africans, will they accept this,\" he asked on Pitroda's prejudiced remarks.\n\nAt a press conference, Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar cited Pitroda's long association with the Gandhi family and said he is explaining Sonia Gandhi's and Rahul Gandhi's idea of India. \"When a senior Congress leader uses such language, it reveals the mindset of the party's leadership, which is grounded in divisiveness, racism and ignorance,\" Chandrasekhar alleged.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, \"I am from South India. I look Indian! My team has enthusiastic members from northeast India. They look Indian! My colleagues from west India look Indian! But, for the racist, who is the mentor of Rahul Gandhi, we all look African, Chinese, Arab and White! Thanks for revealing your mindset and your attitude. INDI Alliance's shame!\"\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 8, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Pitroda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Pitroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droupadi_Murmu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Droupadi Murmu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairam_Ramesh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jairam Ramesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajeev_Chandrasekhar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajeev Chandrasekhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeast India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Jainism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Jainism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/h8gcbb/article68154160.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Sam_Pitroda_24_03_10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548828", "eventUri": "eng-9548828", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Doesn't matter. We are all brothers and sisters.\"\n\nWhile the Congress was quick to distance itself from the remarks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi latched on Pitroda's remarks to target Rahul Gandhi.\n\n\"Shehzade, aapko jawaab dena padega (Prince, you'll have to give an answer),\" Modi said at a rally in Telangana, adding that the country would not tolerate \"disrespect to countrymen on the basis of their skin colour and Modi will never tolerate this\".\n\n\"Today I found out why the Congress was trying so hard to defeat Droupadi Murmu, daughter of a tribal. Today I got to know that Shehzade's uncle lives in America and that this uncle is his philosophical guide who has exposed his secret. He has said that those who have black skin are from Africa. This means that you are abusing several people of the country on the basis of their skin colour,\" he said.\n\nThis is the second controversy in as many months that has forced the Congress to disassociate itself from remarks made by the technocrat-politician.\n\nLast month, the party found itself in a muddle after Pitroda, in another interview, cited the example of inheritance tax in some US states to suggest that Indians, too, should debate the issue. \"In America... if one has $100 million worth of wealth, when he dies, he can only transfer probably 45 percent to his children... 55 percent is grabbed by the government,\" Pitroda told ANI in an interview.\n\nDividing his time between the US and India, Pitroda had previously served as the chairman of the National Knowledge Commission and formally served as the Advisor to the Prime Minister on Public Information Infrastructure and Innovation.

We could hold a country together as diverse as India, where people in the East look like Chinese, people in the West look like Arab, people in the North look like white and maybe people in the South look like Africans.\"\n\nEarlier, following Congress leader Sam Pitroda's \"racist remarks\" that stoked a massive row, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that the people of the country will not tolerate insults based on the colour of their skin.\n\n'Shehzade aapko jawaab dena padega'. My country will not tolerate the disrespect of my countrymen based on their skin colour and Modi will never tolerate this...\" he said.\n\nPM Modi said, \"I was thinking a lot that (President) Droupadi Murmu who has a very good reputation and is the daughter of an Adivasi family, then why is Congress trying so hard to defeat her but today I got to know the reason.

Opposition to a candidate was also not based on the colour of the skin.Support or opposition was a political decision, and every elector abided by the decision of his or her party,'' the former union minister said.\n\n''Why did the Hon'ble PM bring the colour of the skin into the election debate,'' he asked.\n\n''The PM's remarks are completely irrelevant and blatantly racist,'' the Congress leader alleged.\n\nPrime Minister Modi on Wednesday attacked the Congress over its party leader Sam Pitroda's comments over skin colour and asserted that the countrymen would not tolerate insult on the basis of skin colour.\n\nHitting out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Modi said he has now understood that the national party sought to defeat President Murmu in the presidential poll as her ''skin colour is dark''.\n\nPitroda's comments that people in the eastern parts of the country resembled the Chinese, while those from the south looked like Africans had kicked up a row.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Chidambaram", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "P.

He had said, \"We could hold a country together as diverse as India, where people on the east look like Chinese, people on the West looked like Arab, people on the North look like white and may be people on the South look like Africans.\"\n\nTaking a cue from Pitroda's unsavoury comment on the racial backgrounds of the people of India, Mr Modi said Congress' opposition to Draupadi Murmu's candidature for the post of president stemmed from its racist mentality.\n\nThe prime minister, who is on a whirlwind election tour in Telangana, addressed back-to-back two public meetings on Wednesday, one in Karimnagar, and another in Warangal.\n\nSpeaking at the election rally in Warangal, Mr Modi took on Rahul Gandhi, who he referred to as 'Shahzade', saying, \"I am very angry today... Today, the Shahzada's philosopher resorted to such a huge abuse (of Indians) that it angered me. Tell me, are you going to judge a person on the basis of his calibre or his skin colour? Who permitted the Shahzada to indulge in this game of skin colour?\"\n\nHe said those who dance with the Constitution on their head \"are insulting my countrymen based on their skin colour\". \"Shahzade, you must reply. My country will not tolerate this kind of insult based on complexion. Neither will Modi,\" he thundered.\n\nReferring to Pitroda as Rahul's philosopher and guide, Mr Modi said, \"He (Pitroda) said those with dark skin are from Africa. That means based on skin colour they have abused so many people in the country. I read it's based on skin colour, they thought Draupadi Murmu was also an African. So, they thought she should be defeated as she was dark skinned... Whatever may be the complexion, we are the people who worship Sri Krishna who is just like us.\"\n\nAccusing Congress of clandestine deals with businessmen like Ambani and Adani, he said, \"The moment elections were announced, these people (the Opposition) stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. Now, I would like to ask from the land of Telangana let the Shahzade announce how much (money) they have extorted from Ambani-Adani? How many sacks filled with black money did you get? How many tempos laden with cash did you receive? What deals have you made to stop abusing Ambani-Adani,\" he asked.\n\nLikening Congress and the BRS to two sides of a coin, he said since both of them are linked to the same \"corruption syndicate\" when BRS was in power, it did not investigate the cash-for-vote case just as Congress refrained from probing the Kaleshwaram scam of the BRS.\n\nHe also accused Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy of extorting money from Telangana and sending it to Delhi. \"Double 'R' has left the hit movie 'RRR' far behind in terms of collections. One 'R' loots Telangana, and then passes it on to the other 'R' in Delhi. The game of the double 'R' will soon ruin Telangana,\" Mr Modi alleged.\n\nAlleging that the BRS and Congress handed over Hyderabad to the AIMIM on a lease, he said Congress should be wiped out from Telangana so that the Ram Mandir could be protected (against their sectarian politics).\n\nThe prime minister, who had an overnight stay at the Raj Bhavan in Hyderabad, met the family of former PV Narasimha Rao. At the rally in Karimnagar, he recounted how the Congress party meted out to the former prime minister with a raw deal.

Modi and BJP functionaries seized the opportunity and pounced on Congress, attacking them for Pitroda's comments. Congress, however, distanced itself from the comments and Pitroda resigned from post of president of Congress NRI wing.\n\nTN Congress president K Selvaperunthagai too condemned Modi saying the PM was trying to create a split in the alliance. In a statement, he asked why Modi was unnecessarily dragging CM Stalin into the issue. \"Modi by fabricating the speech has an ulterior motive of creating trouble in the alliance. The Congress has been consistently preventing Modi from achieving his motive by giving steady replies,\" he said.\n\nModi, in his election campaign, citing the remarks of Sam Pitroda, asked whether Stalin would snap the alliance with Congress.\n\nRecalling former BJP MP Tarun Vijay's statement that \"if we were racists, we wouldn't be living with south Indians\", he said Modi's comments linking Congress and Murmu were also on similar lines. \"Modi should seek apology from Tamil people for his comments,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droupadi_Murmu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Droupadi Murmu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Pitroda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Pitroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Chidambaram", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P.

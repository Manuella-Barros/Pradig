While the 2023 season included performances by Wyclef Jean and Lauv, the Hamptons (or \u201cout east,\u201d if you went to boarding school) hotspot is back this year with sets by Alesso, Shaboozey, Sofi Tukker, and more. Additional musical acts will be announced on a rolling basis. The venue is no stranger to some of music\u2019s biggest acts coming through to party in Montauk: In recent years, the likes of Halsey, Anderson .Paak, John Legend, and Lauryn Hill have hit the deck for sunset sets. \u201cI have my ear out for new artists too; we have a history of showcasing up-and-comers at The Surf Lodge, many of whom go on to win Grammys,\u201d founder Jayma Cardoso told Rolling Stone in 2022. Traditionally, the music lineup has featured DJs and electronic music stars on Friday, indie or band acts on Sunday, and a mix on Saturday. This year, those indie and band shows are moving to Monday to stretch out the weekend programming as far as it can go. \u201cI want there to be something for everyone in our lineup over the course of a summer,\u201d Cardoso said. While the preliminary schedule below is set for this summer, there\u2019s always surprises that pop up (like when Jimmy Buffett hopped on stage during a Wyclef Jean set in 2018). Tickets for each week go on sale here.

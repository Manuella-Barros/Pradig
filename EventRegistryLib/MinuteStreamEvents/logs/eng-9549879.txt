The Singapore Venture & Private Capital Association (SVCA) includes state funds GIC and Temasek, local and global venture firms, and buyout groups including General Atlantic, Warburg Pincus and KKR.\n\nDiscussions have been going on since the beginning of the year, the people added, and the SVCA's proposals are also being considered by the government's Economic Development Board, Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nThe government did not commission the document, but it has appeared as it discusses policy changes with SGX to boost the stock market. The two are responding to the next wave of south-east Asian companies -- such as Singapore-based automotive marketplace Carro -- opting for the US over Singapore to list.\n\n\"There has been a shift in thinking by the government that this is not just an SGX problem but important to Singapore's national agenda. Is it possible to be a well-rounded and relevant international financial centre with an anaemic stock market? Perhaps not,\" said an industry executive involved with the discussions.\n\nOne person involved in the document's creation who did not wish to be named said they had \"not seen an all-government and industry approach like this since Singapore first decided it wanted to foster a tech and venture capital industry in the late 2000s\".\n\n\"For the first time, they seem more willing to consider more maverick, aggressive moves such as investing pension money -- which is normal elsewhere but new for Singapore.\"\n\nSGX chair Koh Boon Hwee, appointed last year, has been heavily involved and more willing to hear fresh perspectives, the people said. Koh, a business veteran in the city-state, has also chaired telecoms group Singtel, the city's biggest bank DBS and Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe MAS said it \"has received the proposals and is reviewing them\". SGX, the EDB and MTI declined to comment.\n\nSingapore has risen as a financial centre in recent years, boosted by a crackdown by China's President Xi Jinping on the rival business hub of Hong Kong and record amounts of private wealth and capital flowing into the island state, regarded as a haven for its stability and business-friendly, low tax market.\n\nBut the government's success in private markets has never flowed through to its stock exchange -- even as more new economy and technology companies set up their headquarters in Singapore.\n\nSGX has been dogged by low volumes and questions over corporate disclosure practices. Delistings frequently outnumber listings. The bourse has a high concentration of businesses in which state investor Temasek has a big block stake, as well as asset-heavy companies such as real estate investment trusts that have languished in recent years amid higher interest rates.\n\nThe exchange was one of the quietest globally last year in terms of deals and funds raised, at seven and $300mn respectively, according to PwC research. Its poor performance has become starker with regional exchanges preparing for an initial public offering revival as global macroeconomic conditions improve.\n\nThe Indonesian stock exchange was among the top five exchanges globally by total number of IPOs in 2023. India recorded its highest number of IPOs since 2017 last year at 234, an increase of 56 per cent on 2022 while private investors are shifting more capital to it in preference to China.\n\nJapanese stocks last month broke a bubble-era record while Hong Kong Exchange has appointed new leadership as the city fights to maintain its status as a major financial centre.\n\n\"There is a growing fear that even some private capital could leave Singapore in favour of being closer to those faster-growing markets, especially India,\" said one Singapore-based venture capital managing partner consulted by the government and SGX.\n\nAmong the proposals suggested is mandating stock market participation from the record sums of private capital that have poured into the city-state in recent years, such as into family offices and other wealth management businesses.\n\nThere are also more politically sensitive suggestions, such as mechanisms allowing pension and sovereign money to be invested in the stock market as seen in Australia or Thailand, the people said. While Temasek invests in local companies, GIC, which manages the government's foreign reserves, only invests internationally.\n\nThe government has also been closely watching other countries' policies, such as the UK dialling up the pressure on pension schemes to help companies grow, the people said. Like GIC, Singapore's Central Provident Fund also has abundant capital. While retail investors can use their CPF money to invest in selected stocks, that does not move the needle in terms of volumes. There is no government policy that mandates or encourages CPF investment into equities at a broader level.\n\nAnother proposal includes more collaboration with south-east Asian stock markets, including the potential for Singapore to host a regional exchange down the track and underpin any issues such as currency risk.\n\n\"Singapore trumpets that it is an 'innovation economy' but has a retirement system that is so risk averse. Building that liquidity might start to incentivise fund managers,\" another person familiar with the talks said.\n\nOthers however questioned whether the latest attempt would be enough to turn around SGX's trajectory.\n\n\"Creating supply and demand is hard. They really need to be talking to market makers like local funds and asset managers and I still am not seeing that,\" said one Singapore-based hedge fund executive.\n\nPrevious efforts, such as tie-ups with the Nasdaq and Tel Aviv exchanges to attract secondary listings, or a Spac regime being introduced in 2021, have failed to work.\n\n\"It's nice to have ideas and to make it part of the Singapore national agenda. But fixing poor disclosure practices, or strengthening corporate governance to give investors more assurance, remain the broader issues for us,\" the hedge fund executive added.", "source": {"uri":

The Singapore Venture & Private Capital Association (SVCA) includes state funds GIC and Temasek, local and global venture firms, and buyout groups including General Atlantic, Warburg Pincus and KKR.\n\nDiscussions have been going on since the beginning of the year, the people added, and the SVCA's proposals are also being considered by the government's Economic Development Board, Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nThe government did not commission the document, but it has appeared as it discusses policy changes with SGX to boost the stock market. The two are responding to the next wave of south-east Asian companies -- such as Singapore-based automotive marketplace Carro -- opting for the US over Singapore to list.\n\n\"There has been a shift in thinking by the government that this is not just an SGX problem but important to Singapore's national agenda. Is it possible to be a well-rounded and relevant international financial centre with an anaemic stock market? Perhaps not,\" said an industry executive involved with the discussions.\n\nOne person involved in the document's creation who did not wish to be named said they had \"not seen an all-government and industry approach like this since Singapore first decided it wanted to foster a tech and venture capital industry in the late 2000s\".\n\n\"For the first time, they seem more willing to consider more maverick, aggressive moves such as investing pension money -- which is normal elsewhere but new for Singapore.\"\n\nSGX chair Koh Boon Hwee, appointed last year, has been heavily involved and more willing to hear fresh perspectives, the people said. Koh, a business veteran in the city-state, has also chaired telecoms group Singtel, the city's biggest bank DBS and Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe MAS said it \"has received the proposals and is reviewing them\". SGX, the EDB and MTI declined to comment.\n\nSingapore has risen as a financial centre in recent years, boosted by a crackdown by China's President Xi Jinping on the rival business hub of Hong Kong and record amounts of private wealth and capital flowing into the island state, regarded as a haven for its stability and business-friendly, low tax market.\n\nBut the government's success in private markets has never flowed through to its stock exchange -- even as more new economy and technology companies set up their headquarters in Singapore.\n\nSGX has been dogged by low volumes and questions over corporate disclosure practices. Delistings frequently outnumber listings. The bourse has a high concentration of businesses in which state investor Temasek has a big block stake, as well as asset-heavy companies such as real estate investment trusts that have languished in recent years amid higher interest rates.\n\nThe exchange was one of the quietest globally last year in terms of deals and funds raised, at seven and US$300 million respectively, according to PwC research. Its poor performance has become starker with regional exchanges preparing for an initial public offering revival as global macroeconomic conditions improve.\n\nThe Indonesian stock exchange was among the top five exchanges globally by total number of IPOs in 2023. India recorded its highest number of IPOs since 2017 last year at 234, an increase of 56 per cent on 2022 while private investors are shifting more capital to it in preference to China.\n\nJapanese stocks last month broke a bubble-era record while Hong Kong Exchange has appointed new leadership as the city fights to maintain its status as a major financial centre.\n\n\"There is a growing fear that even some private capital could leave Singapore in favour of being closer to those faster-growing markets, especially India,\" said one Singapore-based venture capital managing partner consulted by the government and SGX.\n\nAmong the proposals suggested is mandating stock market participation from the record sums of private capital that have poured into the city-state in recent years, such as into family offices and other wealth management businesses.\n\nThere are also more politically sensitive suggestions, such as mechanisms allowing pension and sovereign money to be invested in the stock market as seen in Australia or Thailand, the people said. While Temasek invests in local companies, GIC, which manages the government's foreign reserves, only invests internationally.\n\nThe government has also been closely watching other countries' policies, such as the UK dialling up the pressure on pension schemes to help companies grow, the people said. Like GIC, Singapore's Central Provident Fund also has abundant capital. While retail investors can use their CPF money to invest in selected stocks, that does not move the needle in terms of volumes. There is no government policy that mandates or encourages CPF investment into equities at a broader level.\n\nAnother proposal includes more collaboration with south-east Asian stock markets, including the potential for Singapore to host a regional exchange down the track and underpin any issues such as currency risk.\n\n\"Singapore trumpets that it is an 'innovation economy' but has a retirement system that is so risk averse. Building that liquidity might start to incentivise fund managers,\" another person familiar with the talks said.\n\nOthers however questioned whether the latest attempt would be enough to turn around SGX's trajectory.\n\n\"Creating supply and demand is hard. They really need to be talking to market makers like local funds and asset managers and I still am not seeing that,\" said one Singapore-based hedge fund executive.\n\nPrevious efforts, such as tie-ups with the Nasdaq and Tel Aviv exchanges to attract secondary listings, or a Spac regime being introduced in 2021, have failed to work.\n\n\"It's nice to have ideas and to make it part of the Singapore national agenda. But fixing poor disclosure practices, or strengthening corporate governance to give investors more assurance, remain the broader issues for us,\" the hedge fund executive added.

Perhaps not.\"\n\nAn anonymous individual involved in the creation of the document noted that they had \"not seen an all-government and industry approach like this\" since Singapore's efforts to promote its tech and venture capital sector in the late 2000s.\n\nSGX's Chair, Mr Koh Boon Hwee, a renowned business veteran, has played a pivotal role in championing fresh perspectives, a departure from past practices.\n\nHowever, official responses remain guarded. MAS states it \"has received the proposals and is reviewing them,\" while SGX, EDB, and MTI decline to comment.\n\nSingapore has emerged as a financial hub in recent years, partly due to China's President Xi Jinping's crackdown on Hong Kong.\n\nAdditionally, the island state has seen significant inflows of private wealth and capital, attracted by its stability and business-friendly, low-tax environment.\n\nYet, this prosperity hasn't translated to the stock exchange, plagued by low volumes and corporate disclosure concerns.\n\nDelistings frequently outnumbered listings, and despite attracting new economy and technology firms, SGX struggles to keep pace with its regional counterparts.\n\nLast year, it recorded one of the lowest deal volumes globally and was cited as \"one of the quietest\" exchanges, a stark contrast to the IPO boom witnessed elsewhere in Asia.\n\nRegional peers like Indonesia and India have experienced IPO surges, prompting a \"growing fear\" that even Singapore's private capital might leave and gravitate towards these faster-growing markets.\n\nThe government has been closely observing policies in other countries, like the UK's push for pension schemes to support business growth.\n\nSimilar to GIC, Singapore's Central Provident Fund has ample capital. Although retail investors can use their CPF funds to invest in specific stocks, this hasn't significantly impacted trading volumes.\n\nThere's currently no government policy encouraging broader CPF investment in stocks.\n\nAnother proposal includes fostering closer ties with Southeast Asian stock markets, potentially culminating in Singapore hosting a regional exchange. Yet, scepticism lingers over whether these initiatives can reverse SGX's trajectory.\n\nOne hedge fund executive based in Singapore stressed that \"creating supply and demand is hard.\" He also noted the need \"to be talking to market makers like local funds and asset managers.\"\n\nWhile Singapore touts itself as an innovation hub, its risk-averse retirement system presents challenges. Efforts to attract secondary listings and introduce Spac regimes have fallen short in the past.\n\nThe Singapore-based hedge fund executive said, \"It's nice to have ideas and to make it part of the Singapore national agenda.\n\nBut fixing poor disclosure practices or strengthening corporate governance to give investors more assurance remain the broader issues for us.\" /TISG", "source": {"uri":

It first filed to list in July 2023.\n\nMirxes, which is backed by the likes of A*Star and Singapore's state-linked EDB Investments, was last valued at around US$600mil, which would make its IPO among the largest for a Singapore biotech firm.\n\nLast month, Singapore-based used-car marketplace Carro said it was preparing for a Nasdaq listing in New York to raise about US$100mil. The firm counts GIC and Temasek as investors and is reportedly valued at more than US$1.5bil.\n\nOther Singapore firms such as ride-hailing and carpooling company Ryde and telehealth service provider Mobile-Health Network Solutions have also listed in the United States this year.\n\nIn contrast, only one company has listed on the SGX in 2024 - cancer-treatment provider Singapore Institute of Advanced Medicine Holdings, which raised around S$21.7mil in net proceeds.\n\nVasu Menon, OCBC Bank's managing director of investment strategy, noted that requiring private capital to put money into the local stock market may not solve the SGX's problem, \"unless it also works concurrently at expanding the universe of attractive companies on the Singapore bourse for such capital to invest in\".\n\n\"Otherwise, there is a risk that such private capital may go elsewhere if we force their hands.\n\n\"Instead of mandating them, perhaps incentivising them to consider investing on the SGX could be a better option.\"\n\nMenon added that while allowing sovereign money and pension, such as funds from the Central Provident Fund (CPF), to invest in the stock market could be good for the local bourse, the bulk of this would likely be channelled into blue-chip stocks that have greater trading liquidity.\n\n\"So, the broader market, especially the small-caps stocks, may not see direct benefits. Nevertheless, if large pension and sovereign funds decide to buy into Singapore equities, it could give the local bourse and investor confidence here a boost.\"\n\nBut Robson Lee, a partner for Kennedys Legal Solutions, said further enabling CPF funds to be invested in Singapore stocks would not be a reliable or sustainable solution to revitalise the local share market.\n\n\"The CPF is fundamentally a savings plan to help Singaporeans buy their homes, provide for their medical needs, fund their children's tertiary education and build up their nest-eggs for retirement,\" he said.\n\nCiting the collapse of water treatment company Hyflux in 2021, Lee warned that \"it would be a market and political disaster in Singapore if there are more such corporate failures affecting hundreds or thousands of CPF investors\".\n\nStill, he noted that the authorities are anxious to correct the market perception that a well-rounded global financial centre like Singapore has a lacklustre stock market.\"It is paramount that the authorities fix the fundamentals that have caused, and continue to perpetuate the perception that the Singapore market has poor trading liquidity and low valuations.\"\n\nThese include limited stock research coverage, low valuations and poor corporate governance and regulatory enforcement, Lee said.\n\nEfforts so far have included investments by the government-backed Anchor Fund @ 65 and Growth IPO Fund in a total of nine companies since 2022, when the funds were set up.\n\n\"Both funds are working closely with their portfolio companies to prepare them for IPO when the opportunity arises,\" Trade and Industry minister Gan Kim Yong told Parliament in February.\n\nHe added that these moves complement a broader suite of initiatives to improve the attractiveness of the SGX for IPOs, including grant schemes to defray listing costs and research coverage of Singapore-listed stocks.But high interest rates and companies gravitating to deeper and more liquid exchanges are challenges that will remain for the Singapore equities market, deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in Parliament on May 8.\n\n\"These are global trends, and we have to be realistic about what we can do to change them,\" he added.\n\n\"While the government will continue to encourage Singapore-incubated companies to list in Singapore ... the final listing decisions will have to be made by the companies themselves, based on their commercial objectives and growth plans.\" -- The Straits Times/ANN", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news",

It first filed to list in July 2023.\n\nMirxes, which is backed by the likes of A*Star and Singapore's state-linked EDB Investments, was last valued at around US$600 million, which would make its IPO among the largest for a Singapore biotech firm.\n\nLast month, Singapore-based used-car marketplace Carro said it is preparing for a Nasdaq listing in New York to raise about US$100 million. The firm counts GIC and Temasek as investors and is reportedly valued at more than US$1.5 billion.\n\nOther Singapore firms such as ride-hailing and carpooling company Ryde and telehealth service provider Mobile-Health Network Solutions have also listed in the US this year.\n\nIn contrast, only one company has listed on the SGX in 2024 - cancer-treatment provider Singapore Institute of Advanced Medicine Holdings, which raised around $21.7 million in net proceeds.\n\nMr Vasu Menon, OCBC's managing director of investment strategy, noted that requiring private capital to put money into the local stock market may not solve the SGX's problem, \"unless it also works concurrently at expanding the universe of attractive companies on the Singapore bourse for such capital to invest in\".\n\n\"Otherwise, there is risk that such private capital may go elsewhere if we force their hands. Instead of mandating them, perhaps incentivising them to consider investing on the SGX could be a better option.\"\n\nMr Menon added that while allowing pension and sovereign money, such as funds from the Central Provident Fund (CPF), to invest in the stock market could be good for the local bourse, the bulk of this would likely be channelled into blue-chip stocks that have greater trading liquidity.\n\n\"So, the broader market, especially the small-caps stocks, may not see direct benefits. Nevertheless, if large pension and sovereign funds decide to buy into Singapore equities, it could give the local bourse and investor confidence here a boost.\"\n\nBut Mr Robson Lee, a partner for Kennedys Legal Solutions, said further enabling CPF funds to be invested in Singapore stocks would not be a reliable nor sustainable solution to revitalise the local share market.\n\n\"The CPF is fundamentally a savings plan to help Singaporeans to buy their homes, provide for their medical needs, fund their children's tertiary education and build up their nest-eggs for retirement,\" he said.\n\nCiting the collapse of water treatment company Hyflux in 2021, Mr Lee warned that \"it would be a market and political disaster in Singapore if there are more such corporate failures affecting hundreds or thousands of CPF investors\".\n\nStill, he noted that the authorities are anxious to correct the market perception that a well-rounded global financial centre like Singapore has a lacklustre stock market.\n\n\"It is paramount that the authorities fix the fundamentals that have caused and continue to perpetuate the perception that the Singapore market has poor trading liquidity and low valuations.\"", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kang_wan_chern@straitstimes.com", "name": "Kang Wan

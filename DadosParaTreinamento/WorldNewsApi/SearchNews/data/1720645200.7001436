{"id": 231397422, "title": "Jon Cryer was &#39;unaware&#39; Demi Moore struggled with drug addiction during their relationship in the &#39;80s", "text": "Jon Cryer says he had no idea that Demi Moore was battling with addiction during their brief romance in the 1980s. \u201cWe dated for a short time while we were working on No Small Affair, but I guess our particular affair was, in fact, pretty small,\u201d he told PEOPLE, referencing their 1984 film. \u201cShe was already struggling with a drug problem. One that I was blissfully unaware of until a couple of weeks before the movie ended.\u201d In her 2019 memoir, Inside Out, Moore wrote that she entered rehab at the request of St. Elmo\u2019s Fire director Joel Schumacher before she began shooting the 1985 film. She later relapsed and sought treatment for a second time for trauma, codependency, and substance abuse in 2012, The New York Times reported. Moore\u2019s issues with addiction on the set of St. Elmo\u2019s Fire are also detailed in her former costar Andrew McCarthy\u2019s upcoming Hulu documentary, Brats, about the group of young actors known as the Brat Pack in the 1980s. In an interview from the film, she recalls \u201cgoing to treatment\u201d and the rehab facility staff expressing outrage over her starting work on the film, PEOPLE reports. \u201cThey said, \u2018What\u2019s more important to you, the movie or your life?\u2019 And I said, \u2018The movie! What are you talking about?\u2019\u201d Moore said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any value for myself.\u201d However, the production \u201cpaid to have a sober companion with me 24/7, during the whole shooting\u201d she said of St. Elmo\u2019s Fire. She also praised Schumacher, saying he \u201cstuck his neck out for me\u201d when casting her in the film, which also starred McCarthy, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, and Judd Nelson. \u201cThey could have just found someone else,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not like I had any box-office draw. You know, we were all just beginning. I didn\u2019t have anything to really warrant him sticking by me.\u201d Moore recently told Entertainment Weekly that her only regret when it came to the documentary was that she and her fellow Brat Pack alums weren\u2019t able to reunite for the project. \"I had such a great time sitting down and talking with [McCarthy.] I'm sad there wasn't an opportunity where we were all sitting in a room together talking,\" she said. \"That's my only wish. It's something very unique to all of us that we experienced.\" Brats premieres June 13 on Hulu.

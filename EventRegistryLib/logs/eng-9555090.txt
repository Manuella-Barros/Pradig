Since launching in April, nearly 12,000 educators have already registered for the science of reading-focused course developed specifically for Indiana.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Indiana has faced a continued decline in student reading levels. Today, in Indiana, one in five third grade students cannot read. Central to helping more students learn to read is providing Indiana's current and future educators with high-quality, evidence-based training aligned to science of reading. To support this, Indiana has secured the state's largest-ever financial investment in literacy ($170 million), and today, thousands of educators are already tackling this challenge head on.\n\n\"We know the value and impact that teachers have in ensuring our students are able to read,\" said Dr. Katie Jenner, Indiana Secretary of Education. \"In just less than a month, nearly 12,000 educators have already registered for training through Keys to Literacy. This includes educators seeking to fulfill the requirements of the early literacy endorsement, as well as many others seeking to learn all that they can in order to best serve Indiana students. Thank you to all of our educators who continue to seek additional training in science of reading. Together, we can, and we must, help more Indiana students learn to read.\"\n\nA new state law that passed in 2024 provides at least three years (beginning July 1, 2027) for current elementary and special education licensed teachers to earn Indiana's new early literacy endorsement. Some teachers will have longer than three years to earn the early literacy endorsement if their next license renewal date falls after July 2027. For example, if an elementary or special education teacher's current license does not expire until 2029, the teacher would have five years to complete the requirements. A total of 90 Professional Growth Plan points (hours) are required each time an educator renews their license; the addition of the early literacy endorsement will fully meet this requirement for the educator's next five- or 10-year license renewal.\n\nDue to the incredible early interest for the Keys to Literacy training, additional sessions were added for spring/summer 2024, increasing the total number of cohorts from 12 to 64, each with approximately 200 educators. Additional cohorts are also open for both fall 2024 and spring 2025 in response to the early demand. Teachers can receive up to a $1,200 stipend upon completion. The 80-hour professional development course offered in partnership with Keys to Literacy is just one way that educators can complete the professional development necessary to earn Indiana's new early literacy endorsement. IDOE continues to work with educators to identify other quality science of reading training that may fulfill the 80-hours required in state law.

This new credential aims to familiarize teachers with pedagological practices based on the science of reading research.\n\nMore on science of reading: This Marion County school district had the highest growth in reading scores. This is why.\n\nThe new endorsement requires any current teacher who holds a preK-6 license or a special education license to complete 80 hours of training and pass a final written exam.\n\nThe state is offering free training through the Keys to Literacy program and a $1,200 stipend for those who complete the training.\n\nAll future teachers who do not currently have a teaching license must apply for the endorsement beginning July 1, 2025.\n\nCurrent teachers have until July 1, 2027, or their next license renewal to fulfill the endorsement requirement.\n\nHowever, multiple special education teachers said Wednesday that the new endorsement is unnecessary for them, considering they already undergo numerous licensing requirements in addition to a typical teacher license.\n\n\"Your free training feels like a slap in the face to someone who has earned an AA, a bachelor's, a master's and a license in special education,\" said Maya Simon, a special education teacher at Arsenal Tech High School.\n\nRecent school news: Voters approve Pike Township Schools operating referendum\n\nOther teachers said that the $1,200 stipend to cover 80 hours of training - which amounts to about $15 per hour pay - was not enough compensation especially considering that most of that training would come out of a teacher's personal time.\n\n\"Keys to Literacy requires significant time commitments outside of school taking even more time from teachers than we already donate on behalf of our craft,\" said Sarah Craft, an English and economics teacher at Borden High School in Borden, IN. \"No stipend can replace that loss.\"\n\nIndiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner addressed some of the teachers' concerns briefly, saying that the IDOE plans to ask for more funding for the training stipends during next year's budget session.\n\nTeachers said they were open to the training but wanted to see some changes.\n\n\"No one is asking for the science of reading training to go away, we just want to be able to apply it in a realistic way to prove we are effective,\" said Aaron Eastom, a third-grade teacher at Fort Wayne Schools.\n\nContact IndyStar reporter Caroline Beck at 317-618-5807 or CBeck@gannett.com.

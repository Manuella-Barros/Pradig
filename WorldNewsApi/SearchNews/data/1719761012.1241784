Newmains & District Gala Week kicks-off on Saturday, June 1, with local band The Latitude performing in Robin\u2019s Bar and ends the following Saturday with the gala day itself. The Newmains Big Lunch and Races takes place on Sunday, June 2, from 1pm at the NCT Centre. The fun-filled day will see inflatables, toy stalls, play village and tuck shop all on offer with the NCT Centre cafe also open. Two events will be held on Monday, June 3, with the annual Brains of Newmains quiz at Robin\u2019s Bar starting at 8pm. Teams of up to four people can enter at a cost of \u00a310. For young footballers the heats for the five-a-side tournament will be held at West Crindledyke playing fields from 6.30pm. The finals will be held on gala day itself. Talented kids will be able to showcase their ability thanks to the Newmains & Camby Got Talent show from 6pm on Tuesday at Robin\u2019s Bar. There is more fun for the kids on Wednesday evening at Robin\u2019s Bar with the Song and Dance Factory entertaining children from 6pm until 7.30pm with entry only costing \u00a32. After a break from festivities on Thursday, the annual Old Firm match for adults will be held at the new school park from 7pm. The gala parade itself begins at 10am on Saturday, June 8, from Braedale. The crowning ceremony of 2024 gala queen Aleeza Hanif takes place at 11.30am before a whole host of festivities begin. That includes bands, beer tent, wrestling show, funfair and inflatables which have been sponsored by Inspired Events. Mary Gilfillan, from Newmains Gala Committee, said: \u201cWe have been lucky to have received funding from the National Lottery Community Fund which has helped us bring this year\u2019s event together. \u201cWe would encourage more people and groups to walk in the parade. \u201cThe gala day itself will have lots of activities but the parade itself is always a great spectacle and we would like more people to take part. \u201cI\u2019ve had a word with the big man upstairs so I\u2019m hoping that he listens to me and the weather is good!\u201d *Don't miss the latest headlines from around Lanarkshire.

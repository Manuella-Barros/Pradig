The President of the association, Dr Oyedokun Abiodun,madevtgus call after donating a sum of N5million to the institution, as relief package to cushioning the effect of the recent rainstorms disaster. Dr Oyedokun, who lamented the large scale destruction of the institution\u2019s property by the rainstorm said the donation was the association\u2019s widow\u2019s mite to support the management. Oyedokun used the occasion to appreciate the alumni chapters in Rivers, Delta, FCT, Lagos, Oyo, Ekiti and Europe for their financial supports as he appealed to some members who had made promises to redeem their pledges . He said the institution had already acknowledged receipt of the said N5m, and at the same time, we still want the whole world to know about the problem in the polytechnic\u201d. The president, called on governments at all levels, to see polytechnic education, as the only leeway, towards the desired progress and development, for the country. \u201d In April this year, the alumni association, received the sad news of the havoc, done by the torrential rainfall on the school premises. \u201d Our independent investigations hasve revealed that the damage done to properties, runs into several millions of Naira, but we thank God that the various reports we got, did not include any loss of life. \u201d It is in view of this ugly development, that the alumni association, deemed it fit to give the N5million sum, as our widow\u2019s mite, towards the repair of the damages\u201d, he said. \u201d The Polytechnics are known for practicals, but when the governments failed to provide adequate, and modern equipments , then that means, without modern equipment for practicals, polytechnic products will not be able to do anything. \u201d That is why we are appealing to the Federal and State Governments, to look into that. \u201d If you want to destroy a nation, you don\u2019t need to hold guns, just destroy their educational system first, and you are done\u201d! \u201d Our plea therefore, is that the government should not allow this to happen to polytechnic education, they should equip the institutions, so that they can be more sound, practically\u201d. \u201cHe also said, \u201cWe strongly believe that polytechnic products will be self-sufficient, self-reliant. Most of them will not look for white-collar jobs, as our counterparts in other places, do. They can always be on their own\u201d. He commended the current Rector of the Polytechnic, as somebody that had been able to manage the institution very well. \u201d No crisis, since he assumed office.The alumni association is giving him kudos for this, we believe that through him, this institution will move forward. \u201d We urgently appeal to the various governments, to fashion increased support, in terms of funding, and supply of modern equipments\u201d. \u201d additionally, we call for the elimination of the dichotomy between HND and BSC graduates to further encourage our students in the polytechnic system. \u201d We have been on this particular subject matter, for a long time, the former Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, when the Forum of Nigerian Polytechnics Alumni Association visited him to furnish him with the problems faced in the polytechnics sector, he promised to work on them, but unfortunately, before he left office, he could not address some of the things we are agitating for. \u201d Among those issues are: we want the establishment of National Polytechnics Commission, we want the elimination of the dichotomy between HND and BSC holders, we want Polytechnics to be upgraded to degree awarding institutions, without changing the initial structure. \u201d Let them remain Polytechnics. In China, about 600 universities were converted to polytechnics, because they realized that it is only through the polytechnics that they can advance. We want the polytechnics to remain relevant. \u201d What we are saying is that we don\u2019t want to be inferior in our own system. Before, polytechnic products, even in the system were being treated as second hand graduates\u201d", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0020-1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0020-1.jpg 1080w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0020-1-300x131.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0020-1-1024x448.jpg 1024w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0020-1-768x336.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /></div>The national body of the Alumni association of the Federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti has called on the Federal Government to provide adequate, and modern equipments to the Polytechnic for it to produce high quality graduates.&#160; The President of the association, Dr Oyedokun Abiodun,madevtgus call after donating a sum of N5million to the institution, as relief package [&#8230;]", "url": "https://independent.ng/alumni-association-gives-n5million-relief-package-to-federal-poly-ado-ekiti-over-rainstorms-disaster/", "image": "https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0020-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:06:57", "author": "Popoola Yaqoub", "authors": ["Popoola Yaqoub"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.261}

Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Oakland A's currently have one of the worst home venues in professional sports, and pitcher Mason Miller certainly is not hiding from that.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on \"Foul Territory,\" Miller was asked if he has any plans to get in on the trend of closers having elaborate bullpen entrances with light shows and other effects. Miller said the A's have been \"experimenting\" with a few things, but he doesn't think having the stadium go dark as he heads out to the mound is an option. Why? Because the lights might not come back on.\n\n\"We're trying a couple things out,\" Miller said. \"We talked about the lights. I don't think that's gonna happen. They said the lights might not come back on. ... They seemed like they were kind of experimenting with something. They shut all the scoreboard lights off until I picked the ball up on the mound, but that was a little more of like an awkward silence until I got to the mound. I think they're working on it.\"\n\nMiller also said he's not sure if or when they even turn the lights off at Oakland Coliseum. He said there have been times where he leaves the ballpark late or drives by and the lights are still on.\n\nOakland Coliseum opened in 1966, and the A's have played there since 1968. This is the final season they will have to deal with the outdated stadium, as they are moving to a minor league ballpark next year and a state-of-the-art new facility in Las Vegas at some point after that. Miller and his teammates probably can't wait.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_delvecchio@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Steve DelVecchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Appraisal_and_Valuation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Appraisal and Valuation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mason-Miller-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554948", "eventUri": "eng-9554948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

He gives the team not only its best chance of remaining competitive, and but also its most compelling figure since 2021, when the Oakland roster included Matt Olson, Matt Chapman and Sean Murphy, along with Frankie Montas, Sean Manaea and Chris Bassitt.\n\nIn 16 1/3 innings, Miller has struck out 33 while allowing only seven hits and four walks. His 55 percent strikeout rate is by far the highest among major-league relievers. His ERA is 1.10. His opponents' batting average is .125. And his expected numbers in both categories - a 0.76 ERA, a .087 batting average - are even better.\n\nNo pitcher in baseball throws harder - Miller's average fastball velocity of 100.8 mph ranks just ahead of the Minnesota Twins' Jhoan Duran, who is at 100.7. The A's, in theory, could replace Miller with setup man Lucas Erceg, who has the sixth-highest average fastball velocity at 98.6. But the 1-2 punch of Erceg and Miller in the late innings has proven incredibly valuable.\n\nThe talk about trading Miller likely will continue right up until the trade deadline, unless he is injured or gets moved sooner. If he goes, the return figures to be substantial, perhaps even staggering. The A's otherwise need not bother.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ken_rosenthal@theathletic.com", "name": "Ken Rosenthal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_of_elbow_joint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Murphy_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Murphy (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Chapman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Chapman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setup_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Setup man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bassitt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bassitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Olson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Olson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Montas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Montas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Appraisal_and_Valuation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Appraisal and Valuation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/09174626/GettyImages-2150767660-scaled-e1715291215338.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554948", "eventUri": "eng-9554948", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The German goalkeeper has penned a one-year extension that will keep him at the Etihad Stadium until 2026. His deal was due to expire next summer and comes as a timely boost for City amid continuing doubts about Ederson's long-term future. The Brazil goalkeeper is wanted by a number of Saudi Pro League clubs ahead of the summer transfer window. Sources have told ESPN that City will consider bids for Ederson if he makes it clear he wants to leave. Ortega played a key role for Pep Guardiola last season, making 20 appearances in all competitions. He stepped in after Ederson suffered an injury against Tottenham and made a crucial save from Son Heung-Min as City won 2-0 to take a big step towards securing their fourth successive title. \"I am delighted to be staying at Manchester City for longer,\" Ortega said. \"This is a football club that provides players with everything we need to be our best. Every single day I feel motivated and challenged, and I have improved as a goalkeeper since coming here two years ago. \"My family are really settled here in England, I love everything about it here. Signing this deal means I can now focus 100% on next season and beyond.\" Ortega, 31, has made 34 appearances in two years at City since arriving from Arminia Bielefeld in 2022. He follows third-choice goalkeeper Scott Carson in signing a contract extension, who has has agreed a new one-year deal until 2025.", "summary": "Stefan Ortega has signed a new contract with Manchester City, the club have confirmed.", "url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/40303436/man-city-goalkeeper-stefan-ortega-pens-new-one-year-deal", "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2024/0523/r1336608_1296x729_16-9.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:29:36", "author": "Rob Dawson", "authors": ["Rob Dawson"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.17}

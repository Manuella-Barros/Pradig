Leonor Rodriguez was knocked to the floor on her tying 3-pointer with 6.5 seconds to go only to see her free throw rim out leaving the score tied at 76.\n\nChina's long heave hit the backboard at the buzzer. China plays Serbia on Wednesday.\n\nSpain took the lead to start overtime on a bucket by Megan Gustafson, and Rodriguez had a final chance to put the game away.

Officials went to replay and assessed fouls.\n\nJacqueline Benitz knocked down three free throws to pull Puerto Rico within 57-55. Stankovic then missed her two attempts, then Serbia missed two shots before Puerto Rico got possession with 24.3 seconds left.\n\nStankovic missed her second free throw, finishing with a team-high 15 points.

The talent all around the world in the women's game continues to improve, and that means parity is paramount.\n\nBoth opening Group A games were as close as possible, with Spain beating China 90-89 in overtime and Serbia avoiding disaster by surviving a fourth-quarter surge by Puerto Rico to come out victorious 58-55. After one day of action, Serbia leads the group and Spain is second, followed by China and Puerto Rico.\n\nWith just one game down, Group A is far from decided as we head into the next set of games. Here is a recap of the previous contests and a look at the upcoming matchups.\n\nChina pushed Spain to the absolute limit, losing by just a point in overtime. Yueru had an exceptional game, imposing her will on the Spaniards as she scored 31 points in the defeat.\n\nIt wasn't enough, as Spain's Megan Gustafson led the way with 29 points, eight rebounds, and four steals, while Leonor Rodriguez stepped up big with 25 points. Spain is far from safe, but the win is crucial, and while China lost, there's no reason to think they are done in this group.\n\nSerbia was in the driver's seat up 55-36 heading to the fourth quarter. Then their offense went ice cold, and Puerto Rico went on a tear. They outscored Serbia 19-3 in the final 10 minutes. Puerto Rico not only made it competitive, but, with 23 seconds left, they had the ball down two points with a chance to tie or take the lead.\n\nIt took a Dragana Stankovi\u0107 block on Pamela Rosado to end the comeback and secure the result.\n\nNeither team is favored to dominate Group A, but Serbia is a step closer to advancement with a win. The victory gives them an advantage over Spain with a +3 point differential versus Spain's +1, putting Serbia at the top of the group.\n\nPuerto Rico will take on Spain at 5 a.m. ET (Peacock) on Wednesday, so be sure to set your clock. Spain will be heavily favored and should make quick work of Puerto Rico, given the depth, quality and experience they have on the roster. Spain took on a tough challenge versus China, but Puerto Rico doesn't have that kind of firepower.\n\nSerbia will play against China at 7:30 a.m. ET (Peacock) in a game with huge implications for the group standings. Serbia controls its destiny, but can it contain Yueru and Han Xu down low and earn the upset win? Or will China prove they are the team to beat and earn a statement win?\n\nIf Serbia comes out victorious, that will all but punch their ticket to the quarterfinals. A defeat, however, makes things very interesting. They only have a +3 point differential heading into Wednesday's action, so even if they lose, it's imperative the game is close if they want a shot at one of the top two spots in Group A.", "source": {"uri": "swishappeal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swish Appeal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edwin_garcia@swishappeal.com", "name": "Edwin Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Gustafson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megan Gustafson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Xu_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Han Xu (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Rosado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pamela Rosado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejan_Stankovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dejan Stankovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JsCRTU-KUTSMLpXq76N512RMv_Q=/0x22:4499x2272/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25551367/2164104037.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771023", "eventUri": "eng-9771023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Now it's time to play the games we've been anticipating and see which country is the best in women's basketball.\n\nAll four Group A teams will kick off play on Sunday, July 28, looking to start the competition with a victory. The first game will be Spain vs. China at 7:30 a.m. ET and Serbia and Puerto Rico will end the night of play, with their contest beginning at 3:00 p.m. ET. Both games will be streamable on Peacock and nbcolympics.com.\n\nChina will be favored against Spain given that they are ranked No. 2 by FIBA in the world and have top talent like Han Xu and Li Yueru. With those two titans protecting the rim, China will be difficult to beat. They should earn one of Group A's top spots and advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nStill, Spain is a formidable team. They have players like Megan Gustafson, forward for the Las Vegas Aces, and Queralt Casas, a staple of the Spanish team for years. FIBA also ranks them No. 4 in the world, so this matchup will be a good test for both teams.\n\nThe meeting between Serbia and Puerto Rico is, on paper, an even contest. Puerto Rico will heavily depend on Arella Guirantes to help carry the offensive load. She played very well during the exhibition games before the Olympics, scoring 13 points in Puerto Rico's overtime win versus Portugal.\n\nSerbia will rely on vocal leadership from Tina Kraji\u0161nik throughout these games and players like Yvonne Anderson and Jovana Nogic to provide enough offensive firepower to beat Puerto Rico and potentially upset Spain or China later in the competition. For now, earning their first win on Sunday will be the first step to advancing out of Group A.", "source": {"uri": "swishappeal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swish Appeal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edwin_garcia@swishappeal.com", "name": "Edwin Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Gustafson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megan Gustafson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Xu_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Han Xu (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Yueru", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Li Yueru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queralt_Casas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queralt Casas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Anderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvonne Anderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arella_Guirantes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arella Guirantes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_women's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain women's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nxlkyd9hjjXcqruaoLoCk-JAhLY=/0x0:2873x1437/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25548084/1995411875.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771023", "eventUri": "eng-9771023", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 265, "textEnd": 272}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The Spaniards are trying to bounce back from a sixth-place finish three years ago at the Tokyo Games after taking the silver home in 2016 at the Rio Games.\n\nBut Puerto Rico (0-2) took a 62-61 on a turnaround, fadeaway jumper by Mya Hollingshed with 9.9 seconds left. Puerto Rico then had a final chance for the win. Arella Guirantes tried to work around a screen, but her heave from well beyond the three-point line came up shot at the buzzer.\n\nThe disappointed Puerto Ricans looked around, hoping for a foul call with none coming. Spain, meanwhile, celebrated and danced heading off the court after surviving to improve to 2-0.\n\nThose free throws were Gil's only points of the game. Megan Gustafson, former AP Player of the Year at Iowa, led Spain with 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Leonor Rodriguez added 17.\n\nGuirantes led Puerto Rico with 15 points. Pamela Rosado added 11 and Hollingshed had 10.\n\nJovana Nogic, of Serbia, shoots between in a women's basketball game at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, in Villeneuve-d'Ascq, France.

The Puerto Ricans never led by more than four, the last at 59-55 with 3:34 left after a bucket by India Pagan. But Rodriguez drove for a layup with 2:41 left for the fifth tie setting up the finish.\n\nGroup A has the tightest separation among the women with the first games decided by a combined four points, and Serbia sits atop the group after Spain beat China by a point in overtime to open pool play. If Serbia beats China later Wednesday, both qualify before playing each other Saturday.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nA Puerto Rico fans takes photos during a game between Puerto Rico and Spain in a women's basketball game at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, in Villeneuve-d'Ascq, France.

In the third quarter they defended a lot and we had shots that just didn't go in,\" said Spanish guard Queralt Casas. \"But the important thing is to win, even by a point, now we are thinking about Serbia.\"\n\nIn the other group match, Serbia defeated China thanks to a brilliant combination of 12 points from Tina Krajisnik and 15 from Yvonne Anderson.\n\nThe strength of the European team was clear from the start as they opened up a six-point lead in the first quarter. China, however, rallied before the break and levelled the score at 22.\n\nBut the team, who had Chinese Basketball Association president and former NBA Houston Rockets player Yao Ming supporting on the bench, could not withstand the Serbs' second-half surge.\n\nChina and Puerto Rico have one last hope of making it through when they meet on Saturday - if they can pick up enough points to finish in the top two third-placed teams of the group stage.\n\nThe United States face South Sudan and Serbia take on Puerto Rico in men's Group C later on Wednesday.

Despite 26 points from New Orleans Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado, South Sudan dominated the glass and held Puerto Rico to just 25 points in the second half. Tremont Waters added 18 points while the rest of the team outside of Alvarado combined to score 33 points.\n\nNeedless to say, Serbia should have an advantage upfront and with its depth across the board. Four other Serbs aside from Jokic scored in double figures against the Americans, not including former Gonzaga standout Filip Petrusev, who averaged double figures in scoring during Serbia's Olympic exhibition tour.\n\nPetrusev had four points and five rebounds in over 20 minutes in the loss to the U.S. The 6-foot-11 post could have a much more productive outing against a Puerto Rico squad that has just one player over 6-foot-8 in its rotation and was just outrebounded 55-37 by South Sudan.\n\nOf course, Jokic will be at the helm of Serbia's attack. The Denver Nuggets superstar had 20 points, eight assists, five rebounds and four steals in the opener. With help from Atlanta Hawks guard Bogdan Bogdanovic and Ognjen Dobric, Jokic and company will look to handle business in Group C play and move on to the quarterfinals.\n\nPuerto Rico, in its first Olympic Games since it finished sixth in 2004, has lost five consecutive games in international competition since defeating Domantas Sabonis and Lithuania in the Olympic qualifying tournament earlier this month.

Team USA barely snuck out a win over South Sudan 101-100. In fact, while LeBron James and company finished a perfect 4-0 ahead of the Olympics, three of their four wins came by just single digits against vastly less talented teams.\n\nFans started biting their nails, wondering if the ol' U.S. of A still had what it takes to compete with the other best countries in the world. Could this be the year that the United States streak comes to an end? Well, according to oddsmakers, there's nothing to worry about.\n\nWANNA BET? Check out new customer offers with the best online sportsbooks and sports betting apps\n\nDespite their recent struggles, the United States is still a heavy favorite in most people's eyes. Their win over Serbia in their first contest of the Olympics has also calmed a lot of skeptics down. That said, Serbia was the one team that the United States had major success against during their showcase. Perhaps similar struggles will befall them when they face South Sudan again on July 31.\n\nBut if the United States doesn't win gold, who will? Here's every men's basketball team in the Olympics ranked based on their gold medal odds. All odds via DraftKings as of July 28.\n\nTeam USA men's basketball: Kevin Durant, LeBron James propel USA in Olympic opening win over Serbia\n\nWidely considered the weakest team in this year's Olympics, Japan was actually on a bit of a roll heading into the Paris Games. The team qualified for their second consecutive Olympics for the first time since 1976, and were solid competitors at the 2023 FIBA tournament. A\n\nAlthough Japan suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of France earlier Tuesday, Japan kept it very close, pushing the game to overtime before losing by just four points. Japan is now 0-2 for the tournament, having lost their opening game against Germany as well, and practically eliminating them from gold medal contention. They could still compete for a spot in the quarterfinals, but their odds are very slim. Still, for a team that many considered a heavy underdog heading into the Olympics, this team did surprisingly well despite being placed in a brutal group.\n\n11) Puerto Rico: +50000\n\nPuerto Rico drew the short stick, being placed in the United States' group to open Olympic play. The team has already lost to South Sudan as well, and now get Nikola Jokic and Serbia before facing off against the United States.\n\nIf Puerto Rico wants any chance of medaling this year, they'll need to win over Serbia. However, considering Jokic's ability to take over games, that will be a tough ask for Puerto Rico, which will lean on Jose Alvarado and Tremont Waters for most of their scoring.\n\n10) Brazil: +40000\n\nTwo defeats to start the tournament have put Brazil on their heels. They haven't looked particularly strong either, with their starters only putting up a measly 30 points in their game against France. One of Brazil's top stars, Bruno Caboclo, has yet to get going as well. He's tallied just six points through the team's first two contests.\n\n9) Spain: +15000\n\nAfter a huge win over Greece, Spain has breathed some life into itself. However, the Spaniards still don't have the talent to compete with teams like the United States or France should they reach the quarterfinals. While Spain has good size to handle teams that rely on strong play from forwards and centers, just as they handled Greece, who leaned on Giannis Antetokounmpo, they have struggled to get consistent play from their backfield. That will hold them back for the remainder of the tournament.\n\n8) South Sudan: +10000\n\nDespite their impressive performance against the United States in the pre-Olympics showcase, South Sudan does not have the NBA-level talent that is expected of a gold medal contender. Regardless of their lack of a true superstar, South Sudan has not slowed down with the bright lights on. They handled Puerto Rico in their opening contest and now will get an opportunity to prove their near-win over the United States wasn't a fluke tomorrow.\n\n7) Greece: +4000\n\nNow 0-2, Greece has the best gold medal odds of all winless teams left. Most of that hope lies with Giannis Antetokounmpo though. As we saw against Spain, any team that can limit him pretty much destroys Greece's chances of winning.\n\nThe Greeks have struggled to find consistency shooting the ball. In their first game, they shot just 28.1% from three. In their game against Spain, they shot much better (34.3%), but allowed Spain to shoot a devastating 48.4% from downtown. Antetokounmpo can only do so much. If Greece wants any chance of gold, they'll need their other stars like Calathes, Mitoglou, and Larentzakis to find their strokes.\n\nT-5) Australia: +2000\n\nAfter becoming the first team outside the Americas and Europe to earn an Olympic medal in 2021, Australia disappointed at the 2023 FIBA championship, finishing 10th place. While that was enough to earn a bid for the Olympics, it was also a far cry from where the Australians wanted to finish.\n\nAustralia did well to win their first game of the Olympics, but their loss against Canada showed what most people feared about this team. They just don't have the star power to compete with the strongest nations in the world. Patty Mills, Matisse Thybulle, and Josh Giddey aren't the guys you want to lean on when the Americans are benching Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nT-5) Serbia: +2000\n\nNikola Jokic is arguably the best basketball player in the world currently. A three-time NBA MVP, Jokic alone can keep Serbia in most games. However, when he is off the court, Serbia can't keep pace. Against the United States, Serbia was outscored by 26 points in the ten minutes Jokic was off the court. The Serbians lost that game by...26.\n\n4) Germany: +1800\n\nGermany may not have the All-NBA talent that Serbia, Greece, France, or Canada has, but they are deep. In their opening game against Japan, five players tallied double-digit points. It's clear that Franz Wagner is the team's No. 1 option, Dennis Schroder is the team's facilitator, and everyone else is there to rotate and help Germany maintain their strong offense. After winning the World Cup in 2023, Germany looks to be in a great position to medal in these games.\n\n3) France: +1200\n\nNow we're getting to the big dogs. France earned a silver medal at the 2021 Olympics, and only lost to the United States by five points in the gold medal match. However, after a disastrous performance at the 2023 World Cup, some people started to worry about this team's viability in Paris.\n\nLuckily, the emergence of Victor Wembanyama has prevented France from suffering any massive losses early on. The French were definitely expected to take down both Japan and Brazil. Those wins alone will push France to the quarterfinals. However, their next match against Germany will show whether or not the hosts have what it takes to compete for the top of the podium.\n\n2) Canada: +950\n\nBacked by tons of NBA talent, including 2024 NBA MVP runner-up Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 2024 is Team Canada's best chance to win gold ever. It would be quite the jump for Canada, who has never even medaled in the Olympics. However, the team finally has the talent to do so. With NBA stars like Jamal Murray coming off the bench for this team, Canada flexes one of the deepest rosters of the tournament. Just one great day against Team USA could give the Canadians the gold.\n\n1) United States: -550\n\nWas there ever any doubt? Despite their struggles in the showcase, this is the United States. They have a flurry of NBA MVPs, championships, All-Star appearance, and All-Defense honors on their roster and that's not even taking their starters into account. Any one of their players, be it Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, LeBron James, or Jayson Tatum, can take over a game single-handedly.\n\nSure, there's cause for concern given their inability to put away teams with far less talent, but the United States still won those games. Now that the games have meaning behind them, the United States should kick themselves into gear and start dominating day in and day out.\n\nStream the Olympics: Catch Team USA in action with a Peacock subscription\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

She's maybe/probably/definitely engaged to boyfriend of four years Michael Polansky, she's working with her bleached eyebrows as fast as she can to finish her next studio album, and she's gearing up for another performance of an Oscar campaign when Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux comes out in October. Mother is busy! So the last thing I expected from her now was to announce a surprise concert film... but Ta Da! A recording of Gaga's LA stop on the Chromatica Ball Tour from 2022 has been edited into a film that will stream May 25 on HBO Max. She wrote a brief tome on Twitter to accompany the trailer's release:\n\nAre you ready to return to Chromatica with Lady Gaga?\n\nOn Wednesday, May 8, the Grammy-winning superstar unveiled the trailer and release date for her long-awaiting HBO Original concert special, Gaga Chromatica Ball, chronicling her 2022 stadium tour in support of her 2020 album, Chromatica.\n\nProduced, directed and created by Gaga, the upcoming feature is a taped version of the Chromatica Ball concert at the 52,000-capacity Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on Sept. 10, 2022. The setlist includes classic hits from \"Just Dance,\" \"Poker Face\" and \"Born This Way\" to more recent songs like \"Shallow\" and \"Stupid Love.\"\n\nAlongside the trailer reveal, the \"Rain on Me\" singer, 38, posted to social media with a lengthy note about the film, which will become available to stream via Max on May 25. \"I'm so excited that we can finally share The Chromatica Ball film with the world,\" she began.\n\n\"This film chronicles a time of immense creativity...the fashion, the dance, the music,\" Gaga wrote. \"Revisiting the tour leaves me speechless the way we had each other -- you all showed up for music and art in a big way, and with a level of excitement and freedom that I will never forget. Stadium after stadium. Sold out crowds. The deafening singalongs.\"\n\n\"Chromatica was colorful revenge. The chaos of it all became pure energy and life. With a texture best experienced live,\" continued Gaga, before quoting lyrics from the Chromatica track \"Babylon\": \"Strut it out, walk a mile / Serve it ancient city style.\"\n\nThe Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux star added, \"Self-acceptance is a theme that cuts through all my songs. I believe it is always possible to dig deep and find your greatness. Self-discovery is an art. Self-love is a practice.\"\n\nGaga then turned her attention to the fans, concluding, \"I love you monsters more than I can say. See yourself in every vocal, every fabric choice, the choreography, every image... Here's the truth -- no matter where life or my career has taken me, my time with you always is a path back to a very powerful part of myself. In a stadium filled with YOU it came to life. Thank you for that feeling. I hope you will feel seen when you watch this film. And know that I edited it carefully to honor you.\"\n\n[From People]\n\nMy initial thought on the 45-second trailer is that this looks dark. As in literally. A lot of dark lighting, peppered with flashes of fire and strobe and even a ring light (does she start on a Zoom call?). Maybe I'm turning into an old fogey (don't answer that), but I wouldn't be surprised if my comment after seeing the full concert is \"It was too loud, AND I couldn't understand anything she said!\"\n\nI've said it before and I stand by it: Chromatica is not Gaga's best album. The songs are so short that they feel like incomplete thoughts. But a live performance is a whole other animal, and personally I always feel like Gaga is most Gaga whenever she's live at the piano. (I'm sure the particular piano from this concert will be glad to finally be seen in something other than those Nurtec commercials.) Plus whatever wiring I have that makes me love organization by theme and/or color, those wires are equally stimulated by seeing how Gaga composes the set list. How songs from across different albums play together in new groupings. See, I'm not a fogey; I'm a nerd.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chromatica_Ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Chromatica Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chromatica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joker (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concert film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_Face_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poker Face (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_on_Me_(Lady_Gaga_and_Ariana_Grande_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rain on Me (Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupid_Love_(Lady_Gaga_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stupid Love (Lady Gaga song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_(Lady_Gaga_and_Bradley_Cooper_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shallow (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hit song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_This_Way_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Born This Way (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Dance_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Just Dance (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550449", "eventUri": "eng-9550449", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 718, "textEnd": 724, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 877, "textEnd": 882}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-09-", "textStart": 1269, "textEnd": 1277}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

The trailer for Gaga Chromatica Ball features unique visuals reminiscent of Lady Gaga's iconic music videos. After the concert special, Lady Gaga will star alongside Joaquin Phoenix in the highly anticipated movie Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\n\nOne of the most relevant pop artists of the century is ready to make a statement with Gaga Chromatica Ball, a concert special produced by HBO that will premiere on May 25. The network has released a new trailer for the feature that will allow audiences to witness the power of Lady Gaga when the singer takes over the stage. The special was filmed in the fall of 2022 at the Dodger Stadium, and while it took some time to get the feature ready, viewers will finally be able to sing along to their favorite hits from Lady Gaga's repertoire.\n\nThe trailer features visuals as unique as the music videos Lady Gaga has launched over the course of her acclaimed career. With striking black-and white images, Gaga Chromatica Ball will set the mood for an unforgettable evening that will bring the experience of the singer's latest world tour to the screen. After a delay caused by the pandemic, the Chromatica Ball consisted of twenty shows across a wide variety of countries, in what turned out to be Lady Gaga's first stadium-only musical endeavor. More than a year ago, her fans got to experience her biggest tour to date, and while many of her followers were left hungry for more, Gaga Chromatica Ball will compliment the experience of the live shows just as Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour did when it premiered on the big screen last year.\n\nWhile she has recently appeared in a couple of major studio movies, Lady Gaga remains fully committed to her career as a singer. Gaga Chromatica Ball will feature live performances of some of her biggest hits, including \"Poker Face\", \"Rain On Me\" and \"Bad Romance\". The launch also highlights the industry's renewed interest in concert films after similar titles, such as Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9, left a lasting impression on audiences and studios alike. The release of Gaga Chromatica Ball will also set the stage for Lady Gaga's next project.\n\nWhat's Next for Lady Gaga?\n\nAfter Gaga Chromatica Ball premieres on HBO this month, Lady Gaga will be seen in one of the most anticipated movies of the year.

(Getty)\n\nLady Gaga has finally announced the release of her long-awaited Chromatica Ball film, almost two years after the short summer tour began.\n\nWriting on Instagram, Gaga revealed that the concert special, entitled Gaga Chromatica Ball, took her \"countless hours\" of editing to get right, hence the delay.\n\n\"I spent countless hours in the editing room bringing my vision for this film to life. It is my gift to you - directed, produced and created by me, alongside some of the most talented, creative people in the world,\" she wrote, adding that the film will be released on HBO on 25 May.\n\nA short trailer for the concert tour suggests that it will largely focus on the show itself, rather than how Gaga put the show together, which was the approach taken by Beyonc\u00e9 in her recent film Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9.\n\n\"This film chronicles a time of immense creativity... the fashion, the dance, the music,\" Gaga shared in a lengthy post accompanying the trailer.\n\n\"Revisiting the tour leaves me speechless the way we had each other - you all showed up for music and art in a big way, and with a level of excitement and freedom that I will never forget.\"\n\nThe Chromatica Ball began in July 2022, and ended in September that year.\n\nShe continued by gushing over her fans, dubbed Little Monsters, writing that she edited the film specifically to \"honour\" them.\n\n\"Here's the truth - no matter where life or my career has taken me, my time with you always is a path back to a very powerful part of myself. In a stadium filled with YOU it came to life. Thank you for that feeling,\" she wrote.\n\nGaga Chromatica Ball was first teased back in September 2022, when the musician and LGBTQ+ star and ally confirmed that one of the shows had been filmed by 30 cameras. In June last year, she confirmed that work on a tour film was still ongoing.\n\nYet, as she continued to make headway with other projects including her new film Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and sixth studio album, fans feared that she had let the tour film rest.\n\nThroughout her 15-year career, Gaga has announced various projects that have not made it to fruition, including ARTPOP ACT II, music videos for her songs including \"Venus\", and a concert in space.\n\nFans and queer celebrities alike reacted with sheer joy at seeing Gaga Chromatica Ball finally come to life, with one fan calmly writing: \"YOU ARE SO MOTHER FOR THIS!!! I AM GAGGED!!!\"\n\n\"Lady Gaga, is there anything you CAN'T do,\" another questioned after she revealed that she'd edited the film herself.\n\n\"Thank you for perfecting your art for us.

While Gaga is billed as 'producer, director, and creator' of Gaga Chromatica Ball, the special is executive-produced by Arthur Fogel, John Janick, Steve Berman, and her longtime manager Bobby Campbell.\n\nGaga Chromatica Ball arrives at the beginning of the US Memorial Day weekend, becoming part of the concert movie craze that has inundated the best streaming services in recent years.\n\nAlthough the streaming age has ignited a concert movie craze, many people seem to forget that artists and bands have been making films of their live show for years. I have a feeling this is because concert movies gained something of an 'uncool' reputation in the 2010s - just look at the films by One Direction and Justin Bieber.\n\nBut now, concert specials have attained new heights of popularity, with their releases becoming events in themselves. Just look at Taylor Swift's record-breaking Eras Tour movie on Disney Plus, and the cinematic release of Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9, which saw fans swarm movie theaters in silver and chrome outfits.\n\nGaga appeared to pick up on this craze early on, taking to Instagram in June 2023 to reveal that a film version of her Chromatica Ball tour was on the way - before the rumors of Taylor and Beyonc\u00e9's concert specials had even started circulating.\n\nGaga joins a long line of artists with special concert features to their name, and I'd expect Gaga Chromatica Ball to be nothing less than a smash hit - and I can't wait to relive my summer highlight of 2022.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rowan_davies@techradar.com", "name": "Rowan Davies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chromatica_Ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Chromatica Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(Shawn_Mendes_and_Justin_Bieber_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monster (Shawn Mendes and Justin Bieber song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chromatica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Star_Is_Born_(2018_soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_Face_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poker Face (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Janick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Janick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Glory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Edge of Glory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Fogel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Fogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Romance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Romance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_(Beyonc\u00e9_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance (Beyonc\u00e9 album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Direction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WZhpgn2rVYUHgNqVpjYLom-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550449", "eventUri": "eng-9550449", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 266, "textEnd": 272}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

It's time to relive the neon tint of Chromatica. It's been two years since Lady Gaga toured the 2020 album, and she's been radio silent on the music front ever since. (For those who don't know, Gaga has been in her entrepreneur -- hi, Haus Labs -- and acting bag for a hot minute.) Now, she's returning to her most recent musical era. Gaga recently announced her film for the tour, fittingly called the Chromatica Ball, will release on May 25 on HBO and stream on Max.\n\nOn May 8, Gaga shared the long-awaited news on Instagram. \"I'm so excited that we can finally share The Chromatica Ball film with the world. This film chronicles a time of immense creativity...the fashion, the dance, the music,\" she began the post, which shows a minute-long trailer. \"Revisiting the tour leaves me speechless the way we had each other -- you all showed up for music and art in a big way, and with a level of excitement and freedom that I will never forget.\"\n\nGaga later described Chromatica as a \"colorful revenge,\" a record that hoarded enough \"chaos, energy and texture\" that's best experienced during a live show. That rivet can be seen in the concert film's trailer, where she squeezed in a compilation of high-energy performances in just one minute. There's technicolored lights, props, hair-raising roars from the audience and Gaga commanding the stage with her voice -- just pure excellence.\n\nIn a second post, Gaga also revealed she directed, edited, and produced the film.\n\nThe movie, which sees the singer touring stadiums across the U.S. and Europe in summer 2022, has been in the works for a while. Chromatica Ball's production traces back to September 2022, when Gaga reportedly filmed her final show in Los Angeles that month. Shortly after, she teased on X (formerly known as Twitter) that \"30 cameras\" were pointed at the audience, hinting the concert was possibly recorded for an unnamed project. However, months had passed with no update.\n\nNow, fans will be able to immerse themselves in Gaga's most theatrical, strobe-lit era again.", "source": {"uri": "elitedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Elite Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chromatica_Ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Chromatica Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chromatica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haus Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_lighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neon lighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concert film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/5/8/d61af2ab-a801-48ac-9784-3a3571b0d4fe-3e43e500-6d3c-4232-8021-9ba84d9a574d-getty-1409384519.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550449", "eventUri": "eng-9550449", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 468, "textEnd": 474}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 505, "textEnd": 510}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Filmed during the global stadium tour that took place in 2022, the film offers a front-row seat to the vibrant energy, stunning visuals, and powerful vocals that have become synonymous with Lady Gaga's live performances.\n\nThe excitement surrounding the film is palpable. Lady Gaga herself took to social media to express her anticipation and the significance of the Chromatica Ball experience. In an emotional Instagram post, she described the film as a chronicle of \"a time of immense creativity... the fashion, the dance, the music.\" She reminisces about the tour's incredible energy, the sold-out crowds, and the \"deafening sing-alongs\" that transformed each stadium into a pulsating hub of artistic expression.\n\nGaga goes on to dedicate the film to her devoted fanbase, the \"monsters,\" expressing her immense love and appreciation. She encourages viewers to \"See yourself in every vocal, every fabric choice, the choreography, every image.\" This heartfelt message underscores the film's potential to be a deeply personal experience, a testament to the powerful connection between Lady Gaga and her audience.\n\nThe singer's dedication to the project extends beyond performance. She served as both director and producer, working alongside a team of talented creatives to bring her vision to life. This involvement promises a film that is not just a concert recording, but a meticulously crafted artistic statement.\n\nIn a separate Instagram post, Gaga delves into the meticulous editing process. She describes spending \"countless hours in the editing room bringing my vision for this film to life.\" This dedication to detail hints at a film that transcends a simple concert experience, potentially offering a glimpse into the creative mind of Lady Gaga herself.\n\nThe announcement of the film in September 2022 came after the postponement of the originally planned 2020 Chromatica Ball tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The setlist includes classic hits from \"Just Dance,\" \"Poker Face\" and \"Born This Way\" to more recent songs like \"Shallow\" and \"Stupid Love.\"\n\nAlongside the trailer reveal, the \"Rain on Me\" singer, 38, posted to social media with a lengthy note about the film, which will become available to stream via Max on May 25. \"I'm so excited that we can finally share The Chromatica Ball film with the world,\" she began.\n\n\"This film chronicles a time of immense creativity...the fashion, the dance, the music,\" Gaga wrote. \"Revisiting the tour leaves me speechless the way we had each other -- you all showed up for music and art in a big way, and with a level of excitement and freedom that I will never forget. Stadium after stadium. Sold out crowds. The deafening singalongs.\"\n\n\"Chromatica was colorful revenge. The chaos of it all became pure energy and life.

I believe it is always possible to dig deep and find your greatness. Self-discovery is an art. Self-love is a practice.\"\n\nGaga then turned her attention to the fans, concluding, \"I love you monsters more than I can say. See yourself in every vocal, every fabric choice, the choreography, every image... Here's the truth -- no matter where life or my career has taken me, my time with you always is a path back to a very powerful part of myself. In a stadium filled with YOU it came to life. Thank you for that feeling. I hope you will feel seen when you watch this film. And know that I edited it carefully to honor you.\"\n\nChromatica was released in May 2020 and spawned No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Stupid Love\" and \"Rain on Me\" featuring Ariana Grande, the latter of which earned a Grammy Award for best pop duo/group performance the following year.

We're thrilled to partner with her once again for this breathtaking concert special.\"\n\nThe concert, of course, took place just months after the pandemic began to lift in earnest and celebrated an album that was released in the summer of 2020 -- a dance-party album when there were few parties and most dancing was done at home. Variety's Chris Willman wrote of the concert: \"Gaga has remained undaunted in making it clear that 2020's 'Chromatica' is the album she is very much touring behind, with 10 songs from the two-year-old album accounting for just under half the overall set. There was a sense of post-pandemic victory to Gaga's increasingly lengthy asides, late in the two-hour-plus concert -- 'The whole world did not fade. We're all here, in some kind of way,' she said. But, as an undertow, you might detect a sense of vindication for the 'Chromatica' record itself, in how she's determined not to let it go down as a lamb that got lost in the storm.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chromatica_Ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Chromatica Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_Face_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poker Face (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_(Lady_Gaga_and_Bradley_Cooper_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shallow (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Dance_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Just Dance (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Romance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Romance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_on_Me_(Lady_Gaga_and_Ariana_Grande_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rain on Me (Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupid_Love_(Lady_Gaga_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stupid Love (Lady Gaga song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chromatica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DSC_1186_NEW_4ab72f4d-8306-40e5-a32e-1336babdd604-e1715183495141.jpg?w=968&h=545&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550449", "eventUri": "eng-9550449", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 114, "textEnd": 120}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

It will be the first official footage from her 20-date 2022 summer stadium tour, dubbed The Chromatica Ball. True to form, her fans rejoiced at the news on X, with one fan posting, \"OMGGGG YAAAS, FINALLY!!!!! I'M CRYING.\"\n\nThe trailer features Lady Gaga in futuristic mode, sporting sharp-shouldered black and metallic ensembles that look straight out of the Star Wars cinematic universe - in a good way. At one point, she covers her face with a black claw as the crowd goes wild. She filmed the special to a packed house at L.A.'s Dodger Stadium in September 2022, Variety reports. The song roster includes her greatest hits \"Poker Face,\" \"Bad Romance\" and \"Shallow,\" her Oscar-winning anthem from A Star Is Born.\n\nThe 38-year-old vocal powerhouse released her dance-pop Chromatica album at the height of the pandemic in 2020, when big, fun dance parties were few and far between. Her Chromatica Ball gave her the chance to finally perform her new material live and for a large audience.\n\nHello, Harley Quinn! See Lady Gaga in 'Joker' Sequel: 1st Look Set Photos\n\nThese days, Lady Gaga has focused on her career in movies. She plays Harley Quinn opposite Joaquin Phoenix in the Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, set to release this October. Previously, she headlined House of Gucci with Adam Driver, playing an ambitious fashion wife with murder on her mind. Meanwhile, she scored an Oscar nomination in 2023 for writing the '80s-inspired rock ballad \"Hold My Hand\" for Top Gun: Maverick. When she performed the song at the Academy Awards, she wore plain clothes and next to no makeup.\n\nBut as the HBO footage teases, she returns to her theatrical roots - including multiple costume changes - in Gaga Chromatica Ball, which should offer the first behind-the-scenes glimpse of her creative process since the 2017 documentary Gaga: Five Foot Two that chronicled the making of her fifth studio record, Joanne as well as the prep for her massive Super Bowl Half Time performance earlier that year.\n\nIn that film, Gaga (real name: Stefani Germanotta) opened up about her battle with chronic pain, her problems with former fianc\u00e9 Taylor Kinney and her past feud with Madonna, who once called Gaga's music \"reductive.\"\n\n\"She wouldn't look me in the eye and tell me that I was reductive,\" Gaga said in Five Foot Two, adding \"\"Telling me you think I'm a piece of s-t through the media? It's like a guy passing me a note through his friend.\"\n\nShe said that Madonna, her idol \"as an Italian who grew up in New York,\" had apologized to her, though she confessed she wasn't sure if she could trust her again.\n\nBirthday Girl! Bask in Lady Gaga's Wildest Fashion Looks of All Time\n\nLast month, Gaga sparked engagement rumors when she was photographed walking through West Hollywood with a huge diamond ring on her left ring finger.\n\nShe is currently dating Michael Polansky, to whom she was first linked in December 2019. She and Polansky, the CEO of The Parker Foundation, a global health nonprofit, quarantined together during the COVID-19 lockdown four years ago.\n\nBefore linking up with Polansky, Gaga was engaged to Chicago Fire's Kinney from 2015 to 2016 and to Christian Carino from 2017 to 2019. She briefly hinted at her breakup from Carino, a talent agent, while performing \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" in Las Vegas over the summer of 2019.\n\n\"Last time I sang this song, I had a ring on my finger, so it'll be different this time,\" she told concertgoers.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The movie premieres on HBO on May 28, and will subsequently be available to stream on Max.\n\n\"Put your hands up, come on!\" the singer shouts in the trailer for the film. On Instagram, she elaborated: \"This film chronicles a time of immense creativity... the fashion, the dance, the music. Revisiting the tour leaves me speechless the way we had each other -- you all showed up for music and art in a big way, and with a level of excitement and freedom that I will never forget. Stadium after stadium. Sold-out crowds. The deafening sing-alongs. Chromatica was colorful revenge. The chaos of it all became pure energy and life. With a texture best experienced live.\"\n\nIn a lengthy post, Gaga went on to say she loves her fans -- the monsters -- \"more than I can say.\"\n\n\"See yourself in every vocal, every fabric choice, the choreography, every image,\" she wrote. \"Here's the truth -- no matter where life or my career has taken me, my time with you always is a path back to a very powerful part of myself. In a stadium filled with YOU it came to life. Thank you for that feeling. I hope you will feel seen when you watch this film. And know that I edited it carefully to honor you.\"\n\nLater Wednesday, in a separate post, Gaga went into detail on the editing experience for the film. \"I spent countless hours in the editing room bringing my vision for this film to life,\" she wrote. \"It is my gift to you - directed, produced and created by me, alongside some of the most talented, creative people in the world.\"\n\nThe Chromatica Ball tour was initially scheduled for summer 2020, but was postponed due to COVID-19. The singer announced the film in September 2022, when she confirmed that cameras had recorded her Sept. 10, 2022 performance at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium.

It will be the first official footage from her 20-date 2022 summer stadium tour, dubbed The Chromatica Ball. True to form, her fans rejoiced at the news on X, with one fan posting, \"OMGGGG YAAAS, FINALLY!!!!! I'M CRYING.\"\n\nThe trailer features Lady Gaga in futuristic mode, sporting sharp-shouldered black and metallic ensembles that look straight out of the Star Wars cinematic universe -- in a good way. At one point, she covers her face with a black claw as the crowd goes wild. She filmed the special to a packed house at L.A.'s Dodger Stadium in September 2022, Variety reports. The song roster includes her greatest hits \"Poker Face,\" \"Bad Romance\" and \"Shallow,\" her Oscar-winning anthem from A Star Is Born.\n\nThe 38-year-old vocal powerhouse released her dance-pop Chromatica album at the height of the pandemic in 2020, when big, fun dance parties were few and far between. Her Chromatica Ball gave her the chance to finally perform her new material live and for a large audience.\n\nThese days, Lady Gaga has focused on her career in movies. She plays Harley Quinn opposite Joaquin Phoenix in the Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, set to release this October. Previously, she headlined House of Gucci with Adam Driver, playing an ambitious fashion wife with murder on her mind. Meanwhile, she scored an Oscar nomination in 2023 for writing the '80s-inspired rock ballad \"Hold My Hand\" for Top Gun: Maverick. When she performed the song at the Academy Awards, she wore plain clothes and next to no makeup.\n\nBut as the HBO footage teases, she returns to her theatrical roots -- including multiple costume changes -- in Gaga Chromatica Ball, which should offer the first behind-the-scenes glimpse of her creative process since the 2017 documentary Gaga: Five Foot Two that chronicled the making of her fifth studio record, Joanne as well as the prep for her massive Super Bowl Half Time performance earlier that year.\n\nIn that film, Gaga (real name: Stefani Germanotta) opened up about her battle with chronic pain, her problems with former fianc\u00e9 Taylor Kinney and her past feud with Madonna, who once called Gaga's music \"reductive.\"\n\n\"She wouldn't look me in the eye and tell me that I was reductive,\" Gaga said in Five Foot Two, adding \"\"Telling me you think I'm a piece of s-t through the media? It's like a guy passing me a note through his friend.\"\n\nShe said that Madonna, her idol \"as an Italian who grew up in New York,\" had apologized to her, though she confessed she wasn't sure if she could trust her again.\n\nLast month, Gaga sparked engagement rumors when she was photographed walking through West Hollywood with a huge diamond ring on her left ring finger.\n\nShe is currently dating Michael Polansky, to whom she was first linked in December 2019. She and Polansky, the CEO of The Parker Foundation, a global health nonprofit, quarantined together during the COVID-19 lockdown four years ago.\n\nBefore linking up with Polansky, Gaga was engaged to Chicago Fire's Kinney from 2015 to 2016 and to Christian Carino from 2017 to 2019. She briefly hinted at her breakup from Carino, a talent agent, while performing \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" in Las Vegas over the summer of 2019.\n\n\"Last time I sang this song, I had a ring on my finger, so it'll be different this time,\" she told concertgoers.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_carlson@usmagazine.com",

Stadium after stadium. Sold out crowds. The deafening singalongs.\"\n\n\"Chromatica was colorful revenge. The chaos of it all became pure energy and life. With a texture best experienced live.\"\n\nGaga continued in her post: \"Self-acceptance is a theme that cuts through all my songs. I believe it is always possible to dig deep and find your greatness. Self-discovery is an art. Self-love is a practice.\"\n\nAddressing her recent stint as an actress - she's due to star as Harley Quinn in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux later this year - Gaga wrote to her fans: \"Here's the truth -- no matter where life or my career has taken me, my time with you always is a path back to a very powerful part of myself. In a stadium filled with YOU it came to life.\"\n\nIn March, Gaga said that she had been \"writing some of my best music in as long as I can remember\". Prior to that, she teased that she was working on new music in a social media post earlier this month. The singer posted a story of audio waves on computer screen and layers of music, teasing that she's been back in the studio working on new material.\n\nThe last time Gaga released music as a solo musician was with 2020's 'Chromatica', which NME praised in a four-star review: \"Gaga has fully embraced creating a pure pop album. The record is littered with catchy choruses and glossy production - but it goes deeper than that.\"\n\nThe singer also announced she will return to Vegas with a 'Jazz & Piano' residency, a series she first launched in 2019. Gaga's stay will kick off in June this year, and will run until July.

The run was postponed twice -- first when the world shut down during the pandemic in 2020, then again when only certain stops on the international run were prepared for the return of live music in 2021. When the Ball finally commenced, Gaga leaned into her biggest and weirdest musical modes. She also captured an entire sold-out show on film for the HBO Original Concert Special Gaga Chromatica Ball.\n\nPremiering on HBO on May 25 at 8 p.m. EST, the concert film captures Gaga's September 2022 performance at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. The stadium welcomed 52,000 people to the event, all there to witness the crown jewel of pop spectacle. In the first trailer for the special, the musician performs Chromatica's lead single \"Stupid Love\" and her seminal single \"Born This Way\" against a dramatic stage backdrop.\n\nThe Chromatica Ball tour was a (mostly) career-spanning run split into four acts with a prelude and grand finale. The fourth act alone featured \"Shallow,\" \"Always Remember Us This Way,\" piano versions of \"The Edge of Glory\" and \"1000 Doves,\" \"Fun Tonight,\" and \"Enigma.\" Elsewhere in the set, Gaga performed classics like \"Telephone,\" \"LoveGame,\" \"Bad Romance,\" \"Just Dance,\" and \"Poker Face.\"\n\n\"Gaga is at her best when she's at her absolute, most unbridled weirdest,\" Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos wrote in a review of the tour. \"The interludes make little to no sense and only some of them seem to be related to what's about to happen onstage (like the brutalist hospital pictured before Act One that leads way to Gaga singing \"Alice\" from what appears to be some type of stone slab). The best of the interludes was before the finale, with Gaga at her most melodramatic. She recites a creepy sonnet about art and the responsibility of the artist: 'This life is only art on life support, and nature is a knight. No king, no court,' she says as the vocals chaotically layer. If we found out later she was teasing her part in Joker 2, I'd buy it.\"\n\nShe wasn't exactly teasing Joker 2, but it's all connected for Gaga.\n\n\"I wanted to share a more personal moment with you today, I know I haven't been doing a lot of that lately and some of you are really longing for me to share more of my artistic process,\" she wrote on Instagram, last June. \"I've been experiencing my creativity ever since last summer in a really special and private way. I wrote and produced music for a special project, I prepared for months developing my character for Joker, I filmed Joker for many months (a very introspective time), I have been running my start-up

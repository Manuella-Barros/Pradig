The actress, 42, welcomed her second child - and first with Oli - in January, a baby girl whose name they have not revealed, went braless beneath a plunging burnt orange gown for the occasion. Sienna's silk dress hugged her gorgeous curves and she completed the look with a chunky gold choker and matching bracelet. The stunner, who already shares 11-year-old daughter Marlowe with ex-partner Tom Sturridge, added extra height to her frame with a pair of strappy sandals and toted her essentials for the day in a chic clutch. Meanwhile Oli, 27, cut a dapper figure in a dark tailored suit which he layered over a crisp white shirt and emerald green tie. Standard Industries CEO David's wedding was held on the nearby La Certosa Island with guests, and their cocktails, taken to the swanky venue via water taxi. La Certosa is an island in the Venetian Lagoon and located 500 meters northeast of Venice. Following the star-studded ceremony Sienna and Oli were spotted strolling through the sunshine hand-in-hand. Other guests included Prince Harry's ex Cressida Bonas, 35, who put on a very leggy display in a sparkly brown dress with very racy split. Just five months after having a baby, Sienna stole the show on the red carpet in Cannes last week as she promoted her new movie - Kevin Costner's western epic, Horizon: An American Saga. Her co-star summed her up by saying: 'Her outward beauty is undeniable, but she's so skilled as an actress.' Embracing being a mother again in her early forties, Sienna is undergoing a renaissance with fans and commentators declaring that the British actress has 'never looked better' despite the demands of work and having a young family. Brand and Culture Expert Nick Ede told MailOnline that he predicts that Sienna could be about to 'steal the crown to become the UKs biggest Hollywood star'. He said: 'Sienna\u2019s been looking after herself and got herself red carpet ready knowing this is going to be her big return to the big screen and knowing all eyes will be on her. She\u2019s done everything right and she commands The Croisette' - the beating heart of Cannes. Sienna's breakthrough roles came 20 years ago in Layer Cake and Alfie - but despite winning plaudits for American Sniper her acting career hasn't consistently hit the same heights. But the she is back in the big time despite the demands of a red carpet promotional campaign in the south of France this week, Sienna has also brought her newborn baby and 11-year-daughter with her. Sienna looks to have barely aged a day since breakthrough year of 2004. She has put her health and fitness down to regular yoga and a love of protein-rich fried eggs and vitamin-laden Marmite - ignoring trends like 'chia seed and whatever grains', Sienna said recently. But she has confessed to 'cheating' by using a little fake tan to make her skin glow, her youthful appearance is down to regular facials starting at \u00a3400 for 90 minutes and her famous champagne blonde hair highlights will cost at least \u00a3500. Experts are predicting that 2024 is the year she is stepping out of the shadows having been eclipsed for years by boyfriends such as Jude Law and Orlando Bloom as well as rumoured lovers Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Craig and Brad Pitt.", "summary": "The actress, 42, who welcomed her first child with the male model in January, went braless beneath a plunging burnt orange gown for the occasion.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13461439/Braless-Sienna-Miller-boyfriend-Oli-Green-pals-wedding-Venice.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/26/14/85351987-0-image-m-52_1716731130854.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:27:43", "author": "Editor,Geraint Llewellyn", "authors": ["Editor", "Geraint Llewellyn"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.73}

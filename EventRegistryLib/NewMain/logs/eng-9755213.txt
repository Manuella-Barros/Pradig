He said the provincial government had accepted the demands of the jirga and decided to convene a meeting of the apex committee.\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the district and other areas, including Lakki Marwat, continued their protest sit-in on the fourth day.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manzoor_ali@dawn.com", "name": "Manzoor Ali", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ghulam_mursalin_marwat@dawn.com", "name": "Ghulam Mursalin Marwat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandapur", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gandapur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jirga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bannu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bannu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangash", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sit-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Amin_Gandapur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ali Amin Gandapur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannu_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bannu District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bannu District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakki_Marwat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakki Marwat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dawn (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peshawar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Peshawar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_(administrative_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elder (administrative title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement in Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_Taliban", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistani Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincial_Assembly_of_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Public Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peshawar High Court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2024/07/24094210d8dcb30.jpg?r=094220", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755213", "eventUri": "eng-9755213", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Subsequently, patrolling duties would be performed by the provincial police which will be increased.\n\nThe KP CM said that the government was strengthening the police and the CTD in Bannu by opening recruitment and handing over additional vehicles, as per the insiders.\n\nIn the same meeting, the sources said CM Gandapur assured the Bannu Aman Jirga that Jumma Khan Road will be reopened for movement soon.\n\nWhile talking to Geo News today, Adviser to KP CM on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said that the apex committee was an independent institution to make decisions on matters related to national security.\n\nThe CM's aide said that not only Bannu but steps will be taken to eliminate terrorism across the province.\n\nHe said: \"It was important to take up the Bannu [firing] incident in the [upcoming] apex committee. The constitution of a commission on the Bannu incident will also be discussed in the apex commission's session.\"\n\nThe situation turned unpleasant after the firing incident during the Bannu Aman March last week in which at least one person was killed and 22 sustained injuries during a peace march.\n\nIn the presser, the DG ISPR detailed that some armed men in the peace march opened fire, which led to the loss of life. In Bannu, the army personnel followed their response SOP accordingly, he added.\n\nExplaining the SOP of the army, he said that whenever any \"anarchist group\" approaches a military installation, it is first given a warning, and then it is dealt with.\n\nHe said that as soon as this incident took place, there was a hue and cry on social media. \"This shows how digital terrorists are supporting

present 16 demands to KP CM", "body": "BANNU: The elders from Bannu on Tuesday presented a list of 16 demands to KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and expressed their concerns over the operation Azm-e-Istehkham.\n\nThe demands were presented during a Jirga between the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) provincial government and the Bannu Peace Committee, the council of elders belonging to Bannu district, held at the Chief Minister's House in Peshawar on Tuesday.\n\nSpokesperson for KP Government Barrister Dr Saif confirmed that the Jirga was held at the CM's House, saying that the Jirga had decided to convene the Apex Committee meeting on Thursday.\n\n\"It has been agreed that the Apex Committee meeting will take place on Thursday (tomorrow), with five advisors from the Bannu Peace Committee\", Barrister Saif stated, a comprehensive policy to restore law and order in the province would be formulated in the upcoming provincial Apex Committee meeting.\n\nThe KP spokesperson said CM Ali Amin Gandapur discussed the situation in Bannu with the Bannu Peace Committee members and expressed gratitude for their cooperation with the administration to restore peace after the Bannu incident.\n\nDr Saif added that the members of the Bannu Peace Committee have expressed their trust in Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who will visit Bannu on Friday at their invitation.\n\nRegarding Jirga, the advisor said it has been decided that the Bannu Peace Committee will continue the symbolic sit-in in Bannu.\n\nAdditionally, it was agreed to restore the authority of the police and activate the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu while CM Ali Amin Gandapur's visit to Bannu on Friday is confirmed.\n\nOn the other hand, a preliminary report prepared by the KP government's Home and Tribal Affairs Department blamed \"miscreants\" for the melee at the peace rally that led to at least one death and over two dozen injuries in Bannu on July 19.\n\nThe initial report on the Bannu incident said that on July 19, \"some miscreants\" disguised as protesters threw stones as well as resorted to firing at the site of the security forces' supply depot destroyed in the July 15 terrorist attack.\n\nThe report recalled two incidents that rocked Bannu last week, i.e., a terrorist attack on the cantonment that claimed the lives of eight security personnel and three civilians, as well as the chaos at the peace rally.\n\nIt has been stated in the report that at 4:40 am on July 15, some terrorists attacked the supply depot's gate in the limits of Bannu cantonment, in which eight security personnel and three citizens embraced martyrdom.\n\n\"The jawans of the Pakistan Army gave a befitting reply and shot dead all terrorists, who had received monetary assistance from abroad.\"\n\nThe report has stated that on July 19, different political parties and traders' associations took out a peace rally.\n\nThere were some troublemakers in the rally, who hurled stones at the site of the supply depot, besides setting the tents erected around it alight. \"They also fired at the site using small weapons,\" reads the report.", "source": {"uri":

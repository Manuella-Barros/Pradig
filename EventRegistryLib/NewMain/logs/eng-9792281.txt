Israel, is an obligation under international humanitarian law, as the International Court of Justice has recalled,\" the statement said.\n\nThe German Foreign Office spokesman also said the comments

the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael has come under international criticism due to the high number of civilian casualties and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nTen months on from Israel's air and ground

Although Israeli officials have insisted in public statements that they are simply hunting down Hamas soldiers, many reports have indicated that the Israeli military considers any Palestinian -- adult or child -- to be a potential Hamas soldier. This is also evident from the vast civilian death toll of Israel's indiscriminate extermination campaign so far.\n\n\"Once again, we hear a top Israeli government official saying the quiet part out loud,\" said the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). \"If the Biden admin can't bring themselves to take action to stop the genocide, forced starvation, ethnic cleansing and mass destruction of civilian infrastructure, they should at least be able to condemn the genocidal statements that Israeli officials have been making since last year.\"\n\nSmotrich is also in charge of a plan to accelerate the Israeli settlement of the occupied West Bank, and appeared to warn that the West Bank is next in Israel's crosshairs. As Israel has undertaken its genocide in Gaza in the last 10 months, it has also vastly accelerated its colonial violence in the West Bank, killing Palestinians there at the fastest rate in decades.\n\nEarlier on Monday, in a post on social media, Smotrich also said that Israel is working to \"remove the threat\" of Palestinian statehood through its settlement expansion in the West Bank, saying that he opposes the idea of a Palestinian state outright. Israeli leaders have referred to their genocide in Gaza as a way to mitigate the \"threat\" to Israel posed by Palestinians.\n\n\"Stopping the Arab takeover of the open areas, fighting the terrorist financing of the Palestinian Authority and its leaders and complete Israeli control of the territory [the occupied West Bank].

We are in a situation that requires international legitimacy to conduct this war.\"\n\nSmotrich's remarks sparked outrage in the international community, with the European Union saying the deliberate starvation of civilians was a \"war crime\".\n\n\"It demonstrates, once again, his contempt for international law and basic principles of humanity,\" the EU said in a statement.\n\n\"We expect the Israeli government to unequivocally distance itself from the words of Minister Smotrich,\" the EU said, as it called for access to cover the humanitarian needs of Gazans, including hundreds of thousands of children.\n\nThe EU reiterated its call for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to secure the release of all captives and also to increase the distribution of aid across the Gaza Strip.\n\nFrance also criticised Smotrich, expressing its \"deep dismay at the scandalous remarks\".\n\nProviding humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza is an \"obligation under international humanitarian law\" for Israel as it controls all access to the territory, it added.\n\nUK Foreign Minister David Lammy said on X that there \"can be no justification for Minister Smotrich's remarks\" and called on \"the wider Israeli government to retract and condemn them\".\n\nSince the war on Gaza broke out in October, the humanitarian situation in the besieged Palestinian territory remains dire, with almost all of its 2.4 million population displaced and suffering from food shortages.\n\nDuring the 7 October attacks, Hamas captured 251 people, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military campaign has killed at least 39,677 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant

It's his (Hamas') money, it's his fuel, it's his civilian control of the Gaza Strip. It just doesn't work,\" he said.\n\nIsrael has control over aid that enters Gaza and aid groups are in charge of distributing it. While there have been some anecdotal reports from Gazans of Hamas stealing aid, it's unclear how rampant it is. US Special Envoy David Satterfield said in February that no Israeli official had presented him or the Biden administration with \"specific evidence of diversion or theft of assistance.\"\n\nIsrael is facing mounting criticism from aid groups and international organizations for restricting food aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. A United Nations statement, citing independent experts, indicated last month that famine has spread across the entire enclave. The experts accused Israel of conducting an \"intentional and targeted starvation campaign,\" which they termed a \"form of genocidal violence.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court's prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of \"starvation as a weapon of war,\" among other allegations.\n\nNetanyahu has strongly denied the allegations, saying they are based on a \"pack of lies.\" He has said that if Palestinians in Gaza aren't getting enough food, \"it's not because Israel is blocking it, it's because Hamas is stealing it.\" Israel has stated that it will not end the war until all hostages are freed and Hamas is eliminated. The conflict began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The war has resulted in the deaths of more than 39,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\nSmotrich on Monday advocated for Israeli control of the aid effort \"as a part or as an essential means of realizing the defined goals of the war,\" and said only minimal aid is needed in Gaza in the months and years to come.\n\n\"No one talks about (Israeli) military rule (of Gaza) now. No need to unclog sewers, no need for education, no need for welfare. Gaza in the next two years is (going to be) a war zone. You need food, some medicine and a minimum of sanitation - water, sewage.

It's his (Hamas') money, it's his fuel, it's his civilian control of the Gaza Strip. It just doesn't work,\" he said.\n\nIsrael has control over aid that enters Gaza and aid groups are in charge of distributing it. While there have been some anecdotal reports from Gazans of Hamas stealing aid, it's unclear how rampant it is. US Special Envoy David Satterfield said in February that no Israeli official had presented him or the Biden administration with \"specific evidence of diversion or theft of assistance.\"\n\nIsrael is facing mounting criticism from aid groups and international organizations for restricting food aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. A United Nations statement, citing independent experts, indicated last month that famine has spread across the entire enclave. The experts accused Israel of conducting an \"intentional and targeted starvation campaign,\" which they termed a \"form of genocidal violence.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court's prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of \"starvation as a weapon of war,\" among other allegations.\n\nNetanyahu has strongly denied the allegations, saying they are based on a \"pack of lies.\" He has said that if Palestinians in Gaza aren't getting enough food, \"it's not because Israel is blocking it, it's because Hamas is stealing it.\"\n\nIsrael has stated that it will not end the war until all hostages are freed and Hamas is eliminated. The conflict began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The war has resulted in the deaths of more than 39,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\nSmotrich on Monday advocated for Israeli control of the aid effort \"as a part or as an essential means of realizing the defined goals of the war,\" and said only minimal aid is needed in Gaza in the months and years to come.\n\n\"No one talks about (Israeli) military rule (of Gaza) now. No need to unclog sewers, no need for education, no need for welfare. Gaza in the next two years is (going to be) a war zone. You need food, some medicine and a minimum of sanitation - water, sewage.

The EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell has called on West Jerusalem to distance itself from the remarks, arguing that starving civilians constituted a \"war crime,\" and that advocating for this was \"beyond ignominious.\"\n\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has also called on the \"wider Israeli government to retract and condemn\" Smotrich's comments, insisting that \"there can be no justification\" for his remarks.\n\nGermany's ambassador to Israel, Steffen Siebert, also called the finance minister's statements \"unacceptable and appalling,\" and said it was a \"principle of international law and of humanity to protect civilians in a war.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the issue of humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza has continued to raise concerns from the international community, with human rights organizations warning that the enclave remains at high risk of famine.\n\nThe International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan has blamed Israel for the crisis and has sought arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for using \"starvation as a method of war,\" among other crimes.\n\nIsrael, however, has denied accusations of restricting aid deliveries to the Palestinians, instead suggesting that Hamas was stealing the resources.", "source": {"uri": "northernirelandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern Ireland

civilians must be protected in war and must have access to water and food,\" the spokesman added.\n\nAccording to Israeli media reports, Smotrich recently said it would be \"justified and moral\" to block aid supplies to Gaza until all hostages seized in the October 7 attacks are released.\n\nSmotrich said such a blockade would be justified even if it entailed the starvation of \"2 million civilians\" in Gaza, but argued that the international community would not allow such a measure, the Times of Israel reported.\n\nThe French Foreign Ministry called on the Israeli government to \"strongly condemn these unacceptable statements.\"\n\n\"France stresses that the provision of humanitarian aid to 2 million civilians in an absolute emergency, in an area under blockade where access points are controlled by Israel, is an obligation under international humanitarian law, as the International Court of Justice has recalled,\" the statement said.\n\nThe German Foreign Office spokesman also said the comments would be \"followed very closely\" by international rights courts in The Hague, where Israel has faced allegations of genocide.\n\nBack in May, the chief prosecutor at the

We reject them in the strongest possible terms,\" said a spokesman for the Foreign Office in Berlin.\n\n\"It is an imperative of humanity and a basic principle of international humanitarian law that civilians must be protected in war and must have access to water and food,\" the spokesman added.\n\nAccording to Israeli media reports, Smotrich recently said it would be \"justified and moral\" to block aid supplies to Gaza until all hostages seized in the Oct. 7 attacks are released.\n\nSmotrich said such a blockade would be justified even if it entailed the starvation of \"2 million civilians\" in Gaza, but argued that the international community would not allow such a measure, the Times of Israel reported.\n\nThe French Foreign Ministry also called on the Israeli government to \"strongly condemn these unacceptable statements.\"\n\n\"France stresses that the provision of humanitarian aid to 2 million civilians in an absolute emergency, in an area under blockade where access points are controlled by Israel, is an obligation under international humanitarian law, as the International Court of Justice has recalled,\" the statement said.\n\nThe German Foreign Office spokesman also said the comments would be \"followed very closely\" by international rights courts in The Hague, where Israel has faced allegations of genocide.\n\nBack in May, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, said he was requesting arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\n\nAlmost 10 months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which ordered it to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deutsche_presse_agentur@dailysabah.com", "name": "Deutsche

No one in the world will allow us to starve two million people, even though it might be justified and moral in order to free the hostages,\" he said.\n\nIsrael has imposed a suffocating blockade on Gaza bringing it the territory to the verge of starvation. Relentless bombing by the Israeli military has also made it difficult to distribute the aid that does enter Gaza.\n\nNearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in 10 months, mostly women and children, and more than 91,600 others injured, according to Gaza's health authorities.\n\nICC prosecutors are seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defence Minister Yaov Gallant, but not for Smotrich.\n\nThe far-right finance minister often makes anti-Palestinian statements that stir international outrage. For example, last year, he said the Palestinian village of Huwara in the occupied West Bank should be \"wiped out\" - a statement that Washington called \"repugnant\".\n\nSeveral countries condemned Smorich's latest comments on Gaza. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy called on the Israeli government to retract and condemn the remarks.\n\n\"International law could not be more clear - the deliberate starvation of civilians is a war crime,\" Lammy said in a social media post.\n\nThe European Union echoed that position. \"We expect the Israeli government to unequivocally distance itself from the words of Minister Smotrich, as well as to establish transparency on the reported acts of torture in the Sde Teiman prison,\" the bloc said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli media outlets have also published footage purporting to show Israeli soldiers sexually assaulting Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman prison.\n\nNumerous reports have documented horrific abuse at the facility, including rape, torture, starvation and extrajudicial killings.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States urged Israel to investigate allegations of sexual assault against Palestinian detainees.\n\n\"There ought to be zero tolerance for sexual abuse, rape of any detainee, period. It's a fundamental belief of the United States,\" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.\n\n\"And if there are detainees who have been sexually assaulted or raped, the government of Israel and the [Israeli military] need to fully investigate those actions and hold anyone responsible accountable to the full extent of the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo, File)\n\nDavid Lammy, Britain's new foreign secretary, said \"there can be no justification for Minister Smotrich\u00b4s remarks.\"\n\n\"We expect the wider Israeli government to retract and condemn them,\" he wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nGermany's ambassador to Israel, Steffen Siebert, called the remarks \"unacceptable and appalling.\"\n\n\"It is a principle of international law and of humanity to protect civilians in a war and to give them access to water and food,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe ongoing war sparked by Hamas' attack has plunged Gaza into a humanitarian catastrophe. The vast majority of its population has been displaced within the blockaded territory, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps. The leading international authority on the severity of hunger crises, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, said in June that Gaza was at \"high risk\" of famine.\n\nAid organizations say efforts to deliver food and other assistance have been hindered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. Israel says it allows unlimited humanitarian aid to enter and blames U.N. agencies for failing to promptly deliver it.\n\nHamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in the surprise attack into Israel that triggered the war and took around 250 hostages. Some 110 hostages are still being held in Gaza, though Israel believes that about a third of them are dead. Most of the rest were released during a weeklong November cease-fire.\n\nIsrael's ongoing offensive has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and has caused widespread devastation.\n\nFollow AP\u00b4s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

There can be no justification for Minister Smotrich's remarks and we expect the wider Israeli government to retract and condemn them.\"\n\nIsrael's closest allies, including the US, have struggled so far to convince Netanyahu to increase the stuttering pipeline of humanitarian aid into Gaza since the October 7 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas triggered Israel's retaliatory offensive in the strip.\n\nThat pipeline has been even more deeply constricted by the May seizure of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt by the Israeli military. After Egypt subsequently closed its side of the crossing. The resulting reduction in aid deliveries has pushed hundreds of thousands of Gazan civilians to the edge of famine, while talks to reopen it have not borne fruit.\n\nIn June the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a UN advisory body, said that 96 per cent of Gaza's population faced high levels of acute food insecurity, while more than 495,000 faced \"catastrophic\" levels of food insecurity, including \"an extreme lack of food, starvation, and lack of coping capacities\".\n\nNetanyahu's ruling coalition depends on the support of Smotrich, and the National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, also a far-right figure, who has been accused by human rights groups of allowing rightwing demonstrators to block the transport of humanitarian aid into Gaza, while allowing conditions for Palestinian pre-trial detainees to deteriorate.\n\nBoth Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have demanded that the Israeli military use food and medicine as a bargaining chip to force Hamas to soften its demands for the release of the remaining hostages it is holding captive in Gaza, a move that would violate international and Israeli law.\n\nMore than 100 hostages seized on October 7 were released during a temporary ceasefire in November, but some 115 are believed to remain captive in Gaza, at least a third of who are no longer alive. Several hostages have died in captivity in recent months.\n\nSmotrich and Ben-Gvir have also threatened to bring down Netanyahu's governing coalition if he accepts a hostage swap deal that brings the war with Hamas to an end.\n\nProsecutors at the International Criminal Court on May 20 requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, for using \"starvation of civilians as a method of warfare\" after months of warnings from the UN and other international aid agencies that Israel was deliberately slowing the entry of aid into Gaza.\n\nAt the same time, the UN and other agencies have struggled to distribute what little aid makes it into Gaza through Israeli checkpoints, since the enclave has become increasingly lawless, with churned up roads that make it nearly impossible for trucks to move safely.\n\nSmotrich's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"},

Israel had no choice but to send humanitarian aid into Gaza. \"It's not possible in today's global reality to manage a war -- no one will allow us to starve 2 million people, even though that might be just and moral until they return the hostages,\" he said,\n\nSmotrich, a key figure in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition, advocates for the reoccupation of Gaza, the reconstruction of Jewish settlements dismantled in 2005, and what he terms the voluntary migration of large numbers of Palestinians from the region.\n\nThe European Union denounced his remarks, labeling the suggestion of deliberately starving civilians as a war crime. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described Smotrich's comments as \"beyond ignominious,\" emphasizing that they reflect a disregard for international law and fundamental human principles.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Lammy also criticized the remarks, stating, \"There can be no justification for Minister Smotrich's remarks. We expect the wider Israeli government to retract and condemn them.\"\n\nGermany's ambassador to Israel, Steffen Siebert, condemned the remarks as \"unacceptable and appalling,\" underscoring the international legal and humanitarian obligation to protect civilians during conflict and ensure access to essential resources like water and food.\n\nThe ongoing conflict, ignited by Hamas' surprise attack, has exacerbated Gaza's humanitarian crisis. The majority of Gaza's population is displaced within the blockaded territory, often residing in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in tent camps.\n\nAccording to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, Gaza was at \"high risk\" of famine as of June. Aid efforts are hampered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing violence, and the breakdown of law and order. Israel claims it allows unlimited humanitarian aid but blames U.N. agencies for delivery delays.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in nearly 40,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and significant destruction. Hamas' initial attack killed around 1,200 Israelis and took approximately 250 hostages, with about 110 still believed to be held in Gaza.

imposed a crippling blockade on the Gaza Strip since an Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack, leaving the territory's entire population on the verge of famine.\n\nNearly 40,000 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and over 91,600 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nOver 10 months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of

He said that blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza was a better way of securing the return of the 111 detainees that Hamas still holds, rather than a deal.\n\nNetanyahu has stalled the present discussions over a ceasefire by taking a hardline approach. Yet it was a week long ceasefire in November that secured the return of 105 Israeli detainees in exchange for around 240 Palestinian detainees.\n\nAnd significantly, there was a peace deal in early May that provided the release of all Israeli detainees in exchange for a number of Palestinian detainees. In its final stage, the deal included an end to Israel's siege of Gaza, ongoing since 1967.\n\nSmotrich and other far right Israelis no doubt oppose any deal that includes this progressive step towards lasting peace. Because Smotrich outright wants Israel to colonise Gaza, along with the rest of Palestine. Although, he claims this is not a military objective.\n\nThe May proposal did not mention Israel's military occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. It's unclear how longterm peace is possible without an end to the whole occupation. Hamas agreed to the deal, but Israel rejected it.\n\nSmotrich's flagrant defence of starving Palestinian civilians to death comes after the International Criminal Court announced it is seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant. Among the charges is \"the use of starvation as a method of warfare\".\n\nIn late June, Al Jazeera reported that \"no aid trucks have entered Gaza for weeks\". Israeli restrictions on aid into Gaza are ongoing in August. Humanitarian groups and the UN have long said that Palestinians in Gaza need 500-600 aid trucks daily.\n\nThe IPC, which informs the UN and other bodies, found that \"famine is imminent as 1.1 million people, half of Gaza, experience catastrophic food insecurity\".\n\nBut, instead of enabling enough aid to enter Gaza, Israel brought in a truck on 5 August with the bodies of 80 Palestinians. There was no mention of how or why they were killed.\n\nIsrael's genocide has continued apace.

thousands of children.\n\nThe EU reiterated its call for an \"immediate ceasefire\" to secure the release of all hostages and also to increase the distribution of aid across the Gaza Strip.\n\nFrance also criticized Smotrich, expressing its \"deep dismay at the scandalous remarks.\"\n\nProviding humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza is an \"obligation under international humanitarian law\" for Israel as it controls all access to the territory, it added.\n\nUK Foreign Minister David Lammy said on X that there \"can be no justification for Minister Smotrich's remarks,\" and called on \"the wider Israeli government to retract and condemn them.\"\n\nSince the war in Gaza broke out on October 7, the humanitarian situation in the besieged Palestinian territory remains dire, with almost all of its 2.4 million population displaced and suffering from food shortages.\n\nThe war in Gaza began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nMilitants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,677 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@arab.news", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author",

It's his (Hamas') money, it's his fuel, it's his civilian control of the Gaza Strip. It just doesn't work,\" he said.\n\nIsrael has control over aid that enters Gaza and aid groups are in charge of distributing it. While there have been some anecdotal reports from Gazans of Hamas stealing aid, it's unclear how rampant it is. US Special Envoy David Satterfield said in February that no Israeli official had presented him or the Biden administration with \"specific evidence of diversion or theft of assistance.\"\n\nIsrael is facing mounting criticism from aid groups and international organizations for restricting food aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. A United Nations statement, citing independent experts, indicated last month that famine has spread across the entire enclave. The experts accused Israel of conducting an \"intentional and targeted starvation campaign,\" which they termed a \"form of genocidal violence.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court's prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of \"starvation as a weapon of war,\" among other allegations.\n\nNetanyahu has strongly denied the allegations, saying they are based on a \"pack of lies.\" He has said that if Palestinians in Gaza aren't getting enough food, \"it's not because Israel is blocking it, it's because Hamas is stealing it.\"\n\nIsrael has stated that it will not end the war until all hostages are freed and Hamas is eliminated. The conflict began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The war has resulted in the deaths of more than 39,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\nSmotrich on Monday advocated for Israeli control of the aid effort \"as a part or as an essential means of realizing the defined goals of the war,\" and said only minimal aid is needed in Gaza in the months and years to come.\n\n\"No one talks about (Israeli) military rule (of Gaza) now. No need to unclog sewers, no need for education, no need for welfare. Gaza in the next two years is (going to be) a war zone. You need food, some medicine and a minimum of sanitation - water, sewage.

But I am permitted to express my heart's desires. Where there is no settlement, there is no security. The head of government says that this is not true, but I disagree with him on this issue.\"\n\nHe expressed the view that Hamas cannot be destroyed from either a military and civilian point of view unless control is asserted over humanitarian aid. He blamed Netanyahu for being unwilling or unable to do so.\n\nThe monstrousness of Smotrich's remarks can be seen if we consider that in the 1930s and 1940s, the Nazi high command also wanted to starve its battlefield enemies. The Nobel Peace Center notes,\n\nIt should be noted that Smotrich personally sequestered grain aid trucks last spring and did not allow them to go to Gaza until Biden administration pressure caused him to release them.\n\nSmotrich blamed Netanyahu's civilian control over the food aid for what he saw as leniency, and implied that the military should take over.\n\nHe said it would have been desirable for the Israeli military to assume responsibility for all the aid into Gaza. He said he recognized that the aid had to go into the Strip given current world opinion.\n\nHe complained, It is not possible in the world situation of today to administer a war.\n\nNo one, Smotrich added, will allow us to kill two million citizens with hunger -- even though perhaps that is just and moral as long as they do not return the hostages, one humanitarian step for another.

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court says that intentionally starving civilians by \"depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, including willfully impeding relief supplies\" is a war crime.\n\nSmotrich's comments this week have sparked international condemnation - rightly so - but it's hardly the first time an Israeli government official has said such things. Similar statements have come from other top-ranking leaders since the beginning of Israel's assault on Gaza after the October 7 attacks.\n\nEarly on, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, and Energy Minister Israel Katz all made public statements expressing their aim to deprive civilians in Gaza of food, water, fuel, and electricity.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as early as October 19 said Israel would not allow humanitarian assistance \"in the form of food and medicines\" into Gaza through its crossings \"as long as our hostages are not returned.\"\n\nSo, when Finance Minister Smotrich said this week that \"no one in the world will allow us to starve two million people, even though it might be justified and moral in order to free the hostages,\" it was hardly a surprise. In fact, it was more a like a reminder of the government's ongoing policy.\n\nWe've discussed here before the Israeli government's use of starvation as a weapon of war and collective punishment in Gaza since October. We've highlighted the legally binding orders of the International Court of Justice, requiring Israel to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance. We've also looked at Israeli military strikes on aid workers.\n\nThroughout, we have emphasized again and again the fallacy of Israel's attempt to justify mass starvation as a legitimate response to the Hamas-led attacks on October 7. Yes, taking civilians hostage is a war crime (as are other atrocities committed in those attacks), but so is deliberately starving civilians. Two wrongs do not make a right.\n\nThe devastating impact of Israel's restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza continues. In its latest briefing on Monday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports acute malnutrition cases among children in northern Gaza have increased by more than 300 per cent from May to July.\n\nNo one needed Smotrich's reminder. Everyone knows Israel's policy. And the humanitarian catastrophe it's causing is clear.\n\nThe only question is: when will Israel's allies apply serious pressure on the Israeli government to end this policy?", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Human Rights Watch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bezalel Smotrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Ben-Gvir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collective punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2023/12/202312mena_palestine_gaza_deir_al_balah_bread_line.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792281", "eventUri": "eng-9792281", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 670, "textEnd": 679, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-19", "textStart": 978, "textEnd": 988}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

He also may well be the most dangerous member, by far, of Israel's far right government. He proved this conclusively yet again earlier this week when he condoned the hypothetical mass starvation of millions of Palestinian civilians. I'm not making this up.\n\nSmotrich threw down this particular putrid gauntlet on the heels of Vice President Kamala Harris remarks, following her meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, in which she expressed compassion for the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza while condemning Hamas as \"a brutal terrorist organization\" and reiterating her and the Biden administration's unequivocal support of Israel's right to defend itself against its enemies.\n\nThe part of Harris' statement that triggered Smotrich's latest outrage must have been her determination, shared by anyone with even a shred of humanitarian compassion, that she would \"not be silent\" in the face of \"what has happened in Gaza over the past nine months . . . the images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third, or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering.\"\n\nSpeaking at a conference in Israel earlier this week, Smotrich said that Israel was providing humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza \"because there is no choice,\" and declared that while starving two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza to death \"might be justified and moral,\" the international community would prevent this from happening.\n\nSmotrich's exact words, lest anyone think I might be exaggerating: \"Nobody will let us cause two million civilians to die of hunger, even though it might be justified and moral, until our hostages are returned.\"\n\nIn other words, he would have no problem perpetrating and justifying a genocide, if only the world would let him get away with it.\n\nGenocide? That's precisely what this paragon is saying. According to the 1948 United Nations Convention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, genocide is defined as any of a number of specified acts \"committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.\"\n\nDoes anyone in their right mind doubt that the horror that Smotrich is contemplating would fit four-square into that definition?\n\nLet's remember that the killing of some four million Ukrainians by Stalin's Soviet Union in the Holodomor, or Great Famine, of 1932-1933 has been recognized as a genocide by both houses of the U.S. Congress, as well as a wide array of U.N. member states, as well as the Vatican.\n\nAnd Smotrich was reckless enough to make this utterance at the very time that Israel is being accused of genocide before the International Court of Justice.\n\nThe genocide charge brought by South Africa against Israel at the ICJ is deficient as a matter of law since Israel's \"intent\" in its war against Hamas in Gaza was never \"to destroy, in whole or in part,\" the Palestinians there. Rather, Israel's wholly legitimate goal was and is to eliminate that terrorist organization as an existential threat, bearing in mind that pursuant to its own 1988 Covenant, it is Hamas that is dedicated to the genocidal elimination of Jews living anywhere between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River.\n\nStill, what Smotrich accomplished with his declaration was to point out that while Israel's government envisages the permanent presence of the Palestinian population in Gaza after the end of the current war against Hamas, there is at least one senior member of that government who would countenance that population's destruction. This is a gift to Israel's many enemies and to other antisemites worldwide.\n\nTo their credit, the American Jewish Committee and the ADL have denounced Smotrich's comments in no uncertain terms, as has J Street.\n\nA virulent racist who makes no secret of his hatred for all Arabs and Palestinians, Smotrich epitomizes the ugliest aspects of what is the most extremist government in the State of Israel's 76-year history.\n\nUglier than Netanyahu who repeatedly lies through his teeth, even to President Joe Biden, about his willingness to make a deal to free the hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza for almost 10 months? Uglier than the buffoonish neo-fascist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir who has publicly insulted Biden repeatedly despite the fact that it is the Biden administration that not only has had Israel's back since the Oct. 7 Hamas pogrom but has provided it with literally billions of dollars in military aid and equipment? Uglier than Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli who disparages and denigrates non-orthodox Jews -- in particular Reform Jews -- and members of the LGBTQ community at every opportunity? Uglier than Justice Minister Yariv Levin who makes no secret of his desire to scuttle Israel's independent judiciary in the sycophantic service of his criminally indicted boss?\n\nYes, yes, yes, and yes.\n\nThroughout his political career, Smotrich has espoused bigoted views that belie his professed self-identification as an observant Jew. To highlight one appalling example, in 2016, while a member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, representing the religious Zionist Jewish Home Party, he advocated separating Jewish and Arab women in maternity wards. \"Arabs are my enemies and that's why I don't enjoy being next to them,\" he explained on that occasion, causing future prime minister Naftali Bennett, then the head of the Jewish Home Party and minister of education, to remind him that as a matter of Jewish religious law, \"every human created in God's image is favored.\" That meant, Bennett added, \"every human, Jewish or Arab.\"\n\nIt was also Smotrich who told Israel Army Radio in December 2023 that he was in favor of the mass emigration (ouster?) of most Palestinians from Gaza. \"If there are 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs in Gaza and not 2 million Arabs,\" he said, \"the entire discussion on the day after will be totally different.\"\n\nIn March of 2023, after militant Jewish settlers rampaged through the West Bank town of Huwara in retaliation for the fatal shooting of two Israeli brothers by a Palestinian terrorist from that town, Smotrich backed the rioters' violence that had left one Palestinian dead and several wounded and said that Huwara \"needs to be wiped out,\" an utterance so extreme even for him that he found it necessary (perhaps with the proverbial gun to his head) to apologize for it.\n\nSmotrich has unreserved contempt for Israeli Arabs and Palestinians. \"Arabs are citizens of Israel, for now at least, and they have representatives at the Knesset, for now at least,\" he proclaimed on one occasion, calling into question, at least as far as he was concerned, the civil and political rights Israeli Arabs have enjoyed since the establishment of the state.\n\nAs regards the Palestinians, he contemptuously denies their national identity. \"There is no such thing as Palestinians because there's no such thing as the Palestinian people,\" he declared at an event in Paris in March of this year. \"The Palestinian people are an invention of fewer than 100 years ago. Do they have a history, a culture? No, they don't. There are no Palestinians. There are just Arabs.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, therefore, he has long been an inflexible opponent of Palestinian statehood in any shape or form and instead wants Israel to formally annex the West Bank and dramatically expand Jewish settlements there, a priori impediments to any viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIt would be convenient to dismiss Smotrich as an outlier who does not represent the vast majority of mainstream Israelis who despise him, except that he isn't. He and the aforementioned Ben-Gvir hold the balance of power in Netanyahu's government and could bring it crashing down at any moment.\n\nNetanyahu, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir all aspire to emasculate if not totally eradicate Israel's democratic character and impose a top down quasi-totalitarianism bereft of checks and balances, in particular an independent judiciary that safeguards individual rights. However, while Netanyahu is widely regarded as the ultimate opportunist whose sole goal is to have absolute power, or as close to absolute as he can get, and to exercise it at will, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir are true believers -- modern day fascisti, as it were -- who fit in nicely with many of the ultranationalist and xenophobic groups that are sprouting up across the globe.\n\nIn addition, Smotrich brings another noxious ingredient to the mix. He is a religious zealot who holds a simultaneously messianic and apocalyptic view of Jewish history -- Nehemiah Shtraser of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has called him a \"a disciple of Jewish race theory\" and \"a denier of science, equality and progress.\" In his myopic worldview, \"historical truth\" and \"biblical truth\" are one and the same. To give just one example of his antediluvian mindset, he believes that \"God created the world in six days. The theory of evolution is pass\u00e9 . . . It's delusional to think we came from monkeys.\" Take that, Charles Darvin.\n\nSuch an approach has ominous implications. It certainly should not be lost on anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of Jewish history that zealots and zealotry were key if unwitting allies of the Babylonians and Romans in destroying the Jewish commonwealths of biblical and post-biblical times.\n\nAccording to recent reports, the Biden administration considered sanctioning Smotrich because of his refusal to convey hundreds of millions of dollars to the Palestinian Authority and for his role in blocking enforcement against illegal Jewish settlement construction on the West Bank but ultimately decided not to do so.\n\nIn light of Smotrich's latest vile utterances condoning a hypothetical genocide, perhaps sanctioning him should be put back on the table.\n\nMenachem Z.

However, he said that Israel's hands are tied and they must let the aid in despite his firm belief that it would be perfectly acceptable to block it.\n\n\"We are bringing in aid because there is no choice. We can't, in the current global reality, manage a war. Nobody will let us cause two million civilians to die of hunger, even though it might be justified and moral until our hostages are returned,\" he said, adding that if it was Israel that was in charge of distributing aid rather than Hamas, the hostages would have been returned by now and the war would be over. The problem, according to him, is that Israel lacks \"international legitimacy\" in the war.\n\nSmotrich is no stranger to controversy and has been calling for the genocide of Palestinians since entering the Knesset nearly a decade ago. He has expressed support for wiping out a Palestinian village, earning a rebuke from the U.S. State Department. In a 2021 speech to Palestinian members of the Knesset, he said: \"You are here by mistake because Ben-Gurion did not finish the job in '48 and did not throw you out.\"\n\nHe has also said that \"there is no such thing as a Palestinian people\" in comments the Palestinian Authority slammed as \"racist\" and \"an attempt to falsify history.\"\n\nIn a government meeting earlier this year, he openly called for the elimination of Gaza and its people. \"There are no half measures. Rafah, Deir al-Balah, Nuseirat -- total annihilation. You will blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven,\" he said, quoting a story from the bible in which God commanded the Israelites to eradicate the people of Amalek.\n\nThese comments prompted the Israeli newspaper Haaretz to issue an editorial calling for Smotrich to be fired, noting: \"That's how any properly run country would act, and all the more so a country against which the International Court of Justice in The Hague has issued provisional measures requiring it to refrain from genocide, including one requiring it to deal properly with incitement to genocide.\"\n\nSmotrich isn't the only high-profile Israeli politician who isn't ashamed of his desire to see Palestinians suffer and die. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also compared Gaza to Amalek in comments that were used as evidence in South Africa's genocide case against Israel before the International Court of Justice. Some politicians have even advocated hitting the strip with a nuclear bomb.\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been under a tight siege since fighting broke out between Israel and Hamas terrorists in Gaza, cutting off the flow of essential food and life-saving medical supplies to innocent Palestinians living in the enclave. Aid delivery has also been very limited, and independent UN investigators determined that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war against Palestinians.\n\nAccording to the UN, nearly all of the Gazan population is facing acute food insecurity, while half a million people there are suffering from starvation.", "source": {"uri": "naturalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Western Method To Wage War - LewRockwell", "body": "We have seen a myriad of reports about systematic torture and murder in Israeli concentration camps, aka prisons, for Palestinians.\n\nThese reports come even from prime media which generally serve as outlets of the ruling class. There are by now so many of these reports that there is no doubt that they are real.\n\nHowever there have been no political consequences from those reports. I have also not seen or heard any western politician or any editorials condemning the Israel over these reports. To my best knowledge no western country has punished the Zionist government over such behavior.\n\nThis even as it is obvious who the main people responsible for this are. Everyone knows and talks about them:\n\nMusa 'Aasi, a 58-year-old painter-decorator and father of four, said he heard guards beat 38-year-old Tha'er Abu 'Asab to death in a neighbouring cell at Ketziot in November. One guard told 50-year-old Firas Hassan, from Bethlehem: \"We are livestreaming this for Ben-Gvir\".\n\nBen Gvir's spokesperson said the minister was \"proud\" of his prison policy, and that it was in line with international law. \"The conditions of the terrorists imprisoned in Israeli prisons have been tightened to the minimum required by law. In accordance with the minister's policy, the terrorists do not receive the improved conditions they received in the past,\" they said.\n\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich implies he believes that blocking humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip is \"justified and moral\" even if it causes 2 million civilians to die of hunger, adding however that the international community won't allow this to happen.\n\n\"We are bringing in aid because there is no choice,\" Smotrich says at a conference in Yad Binyamin hosted by the Israel Hayom outlet. \"We can't, in the current global reality, manage a war. Nobody will let us cause 2 million civilians to die of hunger even though it might be justified and moral until our hostages are returned. Humanitarian in exchange for humanitarian is morally justified, but what can we do? We live today in a certain reality, we need international legitimacy for this war.\"\n\nAs no one, Smotrich claims, will let the Zionist kill 2 million civilians by hunger at once, it must be done slowly. By now some 10% of the once 2.3 million people in Gaza are likely already dead - killed by bombs or by the consequences of the war the Zionist are waging against them.\n\nMoshe \"Bogie\" Ya'alon, a former Chief of Staff of the IDF, who also served as Israel's Defence Minister, is quoted by Alastair Crooke as saying this.\n\n\"When you talk about Smotrich and Ben Gvir: They have a Rabbi. His name is Dov Lior. He is the Rabbi of the Jewish Underground, who intended to blow up the Dome of the Rock - and before that the buses in Jerusalem. Why? In order to hurry up the 'Last War'. Do you [not] hear them talking in terms of the Last War; or of Smotrich's concept of 'subjugation'? Read the article he published in Shiloh in 2017. First of all, this concept rests on Jewish supremacy: Mein Kampf in reverse\".\n\nSmotrich and Ben Gvir are sitting right in the cabinet. But has any western country even blocked their travel or entry or sanctioned them?\n\nWhy is this allowed to happen?\n\nBack in February Tarik Cyril Amar found this explanation.\n\nThe Gaza Method\n\nThe West's evolving blueprint for controlling a poly-crisis world by mass-murdering and subjugating the poor, the rebellious, and those deemed \"superfluous.\"\n\nThe non-paywalled full text is available here.\n\nThe West is in decline and it has only one method left to delay it - brute force.\n\nAll of the above means that the West is left with one option: the hardest of powers, if the dumbest, too: military force. And that is where the Gaza Genocide precedent fulfills its most important function as method-setting and method-\"normalizing.\" In a very concrete way, too: For since the 1990s (at the latest), Western militaries - with the US in the lead, obviously - have been thinking intensely about fighting in cities.\n\n...\n\nYou see where this has been going, right? To Gaza. Gaza is not the first but, for now, the worst instance of a doctrinal body of pseudo-technical and rationally vicious thought coming into practice: How to subdue the cities of the Global South (and the poor in general, make no mistake, Northerners), by all and any means. And for this type of very-near/present future warfare everywhere, humanitarian law as we know it - with all its immense flaws - is still too \"soft,\" too restraining. The same holds, of course, for our notions of crimes against humanity, including genocide.\n\nHe concludes:\n\nGaza is a method. A Western method. Fascist, Zionist, apartheid, sadistic Israel is a pioneer, a trailblazer into yet more evil to be done from those above to those below. That is why those above will shield Israel. They are shielding themselves and their future deeds.\n\nI was in doubt about this theory when I first read it. But by now I think that the elite are really planing like this.

starvation claim", "body": "The Cabinet minister urged Benjamin Netanyahu's government to distance itself from the remarks by finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.\n\nIn a speech in Israel on Monday, Mr Smotrich argued that Israel should take control of distributing aid inside Gaza so Hamas does not have any power over it.\n\n\"It is impossible in today's global reality to wage war - no one in the world would let us starve and thirst two million citizens, even though it may be just and moral until they return our hostages,\" he added.\n\nHe argued that if Israel controlled aid into the besieged strip the war could have been ended by now and the hostages be free.\n\n\"You cannot fight Hamas with one hand and give them aid with the other,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr Lammy tweeted: \"International law could not be more clear - the deliberate starvation of civilians is a war crime.\n\n\"There can be no justification for Minister Smotrich's remarks and we expect the wider Israeli government to retract and condemn them.\"\n\nGaza is in the grip of a humanitarian crisis, say aid agencies, after Israel's ten-month military onslaught which has seen nearly the entire population of 2.3 million displaced.\n\nThe latest conflict was triggered by Hamas and other terror groups attacking Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael responded by invading the besieged strip and around 40,000 people in it have since been killed, according to Palestinian health authorities, the vast majority civilians.\n\nTensions have spiralled further in the region following Hezbollah top military commander Fuad Shukr being killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs and the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nAmid the fears of a wider war, Britain and other countries have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon, while commercial routes out remain open.\n\nThe UK is preparing a military evacuation of thousands of citizens, if needed.\n\nThe Canadian government has decided to pull family members of its diplomats out of Israel, the Canadian Press reported.\n\nSeveral airlines have suspended flights to Beirut and some to Tel Aviv.\n\nMeanwhile, US military forces struck targets in Houthi-controlled Yemen in the past 24 hours, destroying two drones, a Houthi ground control station, and three anti-ship cruise missiles, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said today.\n\nEarlier, the Iran-aligned Houthi movement said it had attacked a container ship in the Red Sea and two US destroyers in the Gulf of Aden yesterday.\n\nCENTCOM said in a statement on the US strikes: \"These weapons presented a clear and imminent threat to US and coalition forces, and merchant vessels in the region.\"\n\nIt said this \"reckless and dangerous behavior\" by the Houthis threatened regional stability, but it gave no further details and did not confirm that any US vessels had been attacked.",

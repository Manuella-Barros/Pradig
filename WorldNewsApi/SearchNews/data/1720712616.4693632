{"id": 232051586, "title": "Sebastian Junger, NYC author of 'The Perfect Storm,' explores near-death experience in new book", "text": "Sebastian Junger was dying \u2014 fast. For decades, the famed author, journalist and filmmaker had told the stories of men facing down their own deaths \u2014 be it on the decks of the doomed Andrea Gail, which he chronicled in 1997\u2019s hit book and flick \u201cThe Perfect Storm,\u201d or on the battlefields of Kosovo, Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, which he visited during his lengthy career as a war reporter. But on that day in June 2020, the reaper reached out to him directly \u2014 in the form of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. The avowed atheist watched as disturbing, nearly supernatural scenes unfolded before his eyes \u2014 startling images he details in his new book, \u201cIn My Time of Dying: How I came Face to Face with the Idea of an Afterlife.\u201d A deep, black chasm opened on the floor next to his hospital gurney, the 62-year-old Junger told The Post. Then, his long-dead father appeared overhead, whispering words of comfort. Junger, the father of two little girls, told the doctors in a panic, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hurry. \u201cYou\u2019re losing me right now.\u201d The doctors did hurry, and Junger survived. But the experience shook him to his bones, and an avalanche of anxiety and depression swept over him as he realized the long arm of death could extend far beyond the battlefield. \u201cIt was devastating,\u201d said Junger, who primarily lives with his family in Lower Manhattan, to The Post. \u201cIt completely undid my sense of there being stability and safety in the world \u2014 which war zones didn\u2019t because of course I knew inherently that they\u2019re dangerous and I was choosing to go to them. \u201cSo what was really disconcerting was to then be sort of tracked down by the threat of death,\u201d Junger said. \u201cAnd it found me in the safest place imaginable: Deep in the woods in my home [on Cape Cod]. It really pulled the rug out from under me.\u201d So Junger did what authors do: He wrote the book, released May 21,in which he tried to make sense of the nonsensical and put the fantastical into perspective. But the tome \u2014 which has stayed inside the top 10 on the New York Times\u2019 bestseller list for hardcover nonfiction \u2014 is not the tale of a hard-bitten journalist who suddenly casts aside his atheistic ways in tragedy\u2019s wake. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite: Junger said the slim, 176-page work is an ode to the power and beauty of rational thought. And he hopes it imparts the reader with \u201ca kind of reverence for life\u201d they may otherwise be ignoring. \u201cMany people get to that reverence through religion, but you don\u2019t need to,\u201d the author said. \u201cAnd one of the things that almost dying made me realize was that I was alive. We\u2019re all at risk of not appreciating that sufficiently.\u201d Junger\u2019s tendency to brush aside the notion that a higher power intervened to save his life has rubbed some of his more devout readers the wrong way. \u201cI\u2019ve had a little bit of hectoring from people at readings who say, \u2018You survived by the grace of God, you\u2019re being ungrateful,\u2019 and nonsense like that,\u201d Junger said. \u201cBut for me, the mystery of seeing my father points to something far more mind-blowing than religion. \u201cReligion comes up with rather prosaic explanations for things, like there\u2019s a guy up above us with a beard, sort of stage directing everything and judging us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, the fact that the universe exists and is 93 billion light years wide and came from nothing \u2014 that\u2019s actually the great mystery that we\u2019re here to contemplate it. \u201cLet\u2019s just stop for a moment and consider how stunning that is and that we\u2019re part of this,\u201d Junger said. \u201cIt brought that into focus.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t pretend to know all the answers. In fact, despite his aversion to religion and all its trappings, Junger said the near-death experience also made him wonder if even the physicists \u201creally know what the hell\u2019s going on.\u201d At a reading last month at an Upper West Side Barnes and Noble, he compared humanity\u2019s understanding of the universe to a dog watching a television show: The pup sees the picture moving but has no idea how it got there, why it\u2019s appeared or what went into making it happen. His dive into the very nature of existence ironically led him straight back to his father, a physicist by trade. \u201cIt was a world I hadn\u2019t taken much interest in when he was alive,\u201d Junger acknowledged. \u201cAnd now here I was. \u2026 It was sort of my path out of the wilderness.\u201d In the end, his near-death experience was his \u201cmemento mori\u201d moment \u2014 the one that reminded him he would die, no matter how healthy or strong he was. But he also realized that no one knows when it\u2019s their time to punch out. And the only way to cope with that is to live like it will all end tomorrow. \u201cWhat would you want to focus on if you knew this was your last day \u2014 who would you want to be?\u201d he asked. \u201cThen be that person every day, because you never know. Do you really want to be scrolling through TikTok on your phone on your last day on Earth? \u201cThat, to me, is a sort of beacon in the darkness,\u201d he continued. \u201cI could be that way. And I came to that because of this medical catastrophe. \u201cSo who do you want to be?\u201d", "summary": "Author and journalist Sebastian Junger recently published a book called \"In My Time of Dying\" that chronicles a near-death experience he had after an abdominal aneurysm ruptured in June 2020.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/us-news/sebastian-junger-nyc-author-of-the-perfect-storm-explores-near-death-experience-in-new-book/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/sebastian-junger-2023-83244793.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:50:44", "author": "Steve Janoski", "authors": ["Steve Janoski"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.048}

The Solo 4 headphones were released just this past April and normally go for about $230 with the AppleCare+ bundle. Under the current 34 percent discount, they\u2019re only $150. The deal applies to all three colors of the Solo 4: Cloud Pink, Matte Black and Slate Blue. The Beats Solo 4 headphones brought significant improvements under the hood compared to earlier models, but stuck to the same familiar design externally. They\u2019re touted to get about 50 hours of battery life on a charge without Spatial Audio on, and 45 hours with the feature enabled \u2014 but they managed to last much longer than that in our review, hitting 63 hours with Spatial Audio. Sound quality got a major boost as well. The Solo 4 headphones reflect \u201ca more even-handed tuning,\u201d according to Engadget\u2019s Billy Steele, and don\u2019t suffer from \u201cthe overly bass-heavy EQ that dominated the sound on [Beats'] early headphones.\u201d With the Solo 4, the company also switched to a USB-C charging port, following in Apple\u2019s footsteps. They\u2019re capable of lossless audio when using a wired connection. These headphones don\u2019t offer active noise cancellation, but Beats has implemented a noise-learning algorithm and added beam-forming MEMS microphones for improved call quality. The Beats Solo 4s aren\u2019t the only headphones on sale right now. Amazon is also running a really good deal on the Beats Studio Pro (without AppleCare+). This model is nearly half off, bringing the price down to just $180 from the usual $350.

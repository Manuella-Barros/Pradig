{"id": 239767292, "title": "Bayero submissive to Kano gov, doesn\u2019t deserve removal \u2013 Arewa group chair", "text": "A Federal High Court in Kano annulled the reinstatement of Muhammadu Sanusi II as the 16th Emir of Kano, and the state government has vowed to appeal the judgment. Do you know what is happening in this crisis and how it should be handled? For us, it is good that the matter has gone to court for them to know that we don\u2019t run a banana republic. They understand that the court always has the final say. With this fight going on, the government of Kano State has agreed to appeal the ruling against Bayero. The good thing about the ruling at the court on Thursday was the fact that there is still hope for the common man. It is better if the battle is fought within the confines of the legal aspect rather than for them to take the law into their own hands. They cannot drag their followers into killing one another and this is what we will not accept. It is encouraging to let them do the fight in the court. Whoever the court rules in favour of, the other can appeal until the final judgment. As Kano continues to be embroiled in this emirate tussle between the recently reinstated Muhammadu Sanusi II and his successor Aminu Ado Bayero, what do you think are the likely solutions to end this crisis? There was no trouble when the Kano State Government suddenly created one. There was the idea that the former Kano State governor. (Abdullahi) Ganduje, found a fault in the former emir (Lamido Sanusi). So, what has this one (Bayero) done to Governor Abba Yusuf to warrant him being removed? It was in public knowledge that Sanusi was making himself more powerful than Ganduje. It\u2019s not done anywhere. No governor would take it lightly at that time; no governor would allow a subject to be more powerful than him or emerge a rival. He thinks he can oppose authority. This issue was between the former emir (Sanusi) and the former governor (Ganduje). We are also aware of the story of the new emir (Bayero) who is a gentleman, who does not talk, who does not put himself in politics, and who does not speak against power. What has this one done? How are these sins being committed by somebody? That was the narrative before it became a crisis. What is going on in Kano State is just about the slang that \u2018trouble dey sleep, yanga go wake am\u2019, because there was no basis for the crisis (to happen in the first place). Now that they have resolved to go to court and the court is doing its best, so be it. If eventually it goes in the favour of Bayero, so be it. And if it is in the favour of Sanusi, that\u2019s the court ruling; nobody can go against it. If they appeal and are still not satisfied, they can proceed to the apex court, and after that, everybody will be fine. The understanding is that there must be peace in Kano State. We will not support any crisis. Also, we will not witness anybody losing his or her life as a result of this. They have their families; so, why is it that it is the common people that would put their lives on fire? Nobody should die unnecessarily. It is a legal battle. So, let it be. Some Nigerians have criticised Governor Abba Yusuf for inviting chaos into the ancient city of Kano State after bringing back Sanusi as emir. What\u2019s your position on this? I said the same thing earlier. \u2018Trouble dey sleep, yanga go wake am\u2019. If Ganduje has issues with Sanusi then, what has Bayero done to Abba Yusuf? That\u2019s vendetta as far as I\u2019m concerned. What was his crime? I\u2019ve never seen him make comments against the government. He\u2019s very submissive and loyal to the government. What has he done? There are insinuations that the fight is between two former governors of the state; Rabiu Kwankwaso, who is with Governor Yusuf, and Ganduje. How will you react to this? There was no problem before they created one. Whether it is Kwankwaso or anybody, what matters to me is the interest of the public. The people of Kano State are very peaceful, very productive, and business-oriented; they are doing fine. All of a sudden, these people are afraid that anything could happen. I\u2019m happy today that the matter is being addressed in the court of law which is helpful. People have called on President Bola Tinubu to intervene. Do you think this is advisable? President Tinubu has no business in the matter other than to caution both parties to avoid a crisis. Now that the matter is before the court, it is not about President Tinubu anymore. Let the court decide. Tinubu is the President of the country, but the matter is already before the court, and nobody has the right whatsoever to interrupt. So, let the court should judge, and I stand by that. No matter the way it goes, people must comply. If the court has ruled and anybody then wants to disobey, Tinubu can intervene. Nigerians have begun to say that former President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration of eight years was better than one year of President Bola Tinubu. Will you say this is an unfair and unjust comparison or do you support the argument? If you want the truth from me, you cannot expect someone to come and build a house that was destroyed in eight years by another person in one year. The last administration was nothing other than a disaster, and you don\u2019t expect Tinubu to just come and fix it. But many are saying that things were not as bad as this when former President Buhari was leaving the office. Do you share a similar view? What is happening now that has never happened during Buhari\u2019s administration? Was it not under Buhari that people were killed anyhow? The issue of the exchange rate is happening because of how the last administration bastardised the economy, and Tinubu is just managing the crisis now. About the fuel subsidy removal, Tinubu just pronounced it. The budget prepared by Buhari did not provide for it. The money stolen by people under Buhari crippled the economy. The money that they have stolen is enough to clear our budget in one year at the expense of close to 300 million Nigerians. The only thing I want President Tinubu to do is that he should be more rugged in recovering our looted funds in the hands of former government officials. Since we are not producing anything, what do you expect from the economy? This is not about Tinubu. How do you expect investors to come to the country when the atmosphere is not conducive? Is Tinubu going to perform magic in one year? There is already a template they are working on; so, let\u2019s wait. I\u2019m not working for Tinubu; I\u2019m not a sympathiser of Tinubu\u2019s administration. However, we must be able to be courageous enough to tell the truth. On the issue of nepotism, the country witnessed it during the administration of former President Buhari. Now, some quarters are saying President Tinubu is towing that line. Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, said the President had surrounded himself with \u2018Lagos Boys\u2019. What is your take on this? I\u2019m not among those who join others in the sentiment of painting someone bad. However, if there is any administration that started nepotism in this country, it was that of former President Muhammadu Buhari. He would not pick anybody, anywhere except from his people from Daura and his family members. In the case of Tinubu, he tries to bring everybody from everywhere, with the inclusion of \u2018Lagos Boys\u2019. But everybody is giving his or her best.", "summary": "<p>Founder and President of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, shares his thoughts with BIODUN BUSARI on the lingering emirate tussle in Kano State, among other issues A Federal High Court in Kano annulled the reinstatement of Muhammadu Sanusi II as the 16th Emir of Kano, and the state government has vowed to </p>\n <br/> <a href='https://punchng.com/bayero-submissive-to-kano-gov-doesnt-deserve-removal-arewa-group-chair/'>Read More</a>", "url": "https://punchng.com/bayero-submissive-to-kano-gov-doesnt-deserve-removal-arewa-group-chair/", "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/22230231/YERIMA-SHETTIMA.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:54:17", "author": "Our Reporters", "authors": ["Our Reporters"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.229}

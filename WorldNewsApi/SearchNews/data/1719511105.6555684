Police were called to the Henry Jones playing fields used by East Belfast GAA on Sunday following the discovery of a suspicious object at lunchtime. Searches were carried out and the council-owned pitch in Castlereagh on the outskirts of the city was closed. The Irish Times has learned that underage football training for boys and girls aged five to 14 took place in the morning while the club\u2019s ladies\u2019 footballers were due to play a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) team on Sunday afternoon. The incident is the latest in a series of attacks since the club\u2019s formation in 2020 \u2013 it is now among the biggest GAA clubs in Ulster with more than 600 members, including 200 children \u2013 when a pipe bomb was planted in a bin at the field before one of its first training sessions. Police initiated a hate crime investigation last summer after the club\u2019s nets were set on fire while a hoax bomb alert also led to a pitch closure in May. Many of the club\u2019s members come from a Protestant background, while the playing fields are located in a part of the city that was once a unionist stronghold. SDLP Councillor S\u00e9amas de Faoite condemned the latest incident and insisted that it will \u201conly increase support for East Belfast GAA who continue to go from strength to strength\u201d. \u201cMake no mistake about it, this is a sinister attempt to intimidate one of the most diverse GAA clubs on our island and it\u2019s an attack of the entire community in East Belfast who want to live in peace with their neighbours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not work and those behind it will not win.\u201d The development comes in advance of the beginning of campaigning for the Westminster elections on July 4th. In the run-up to the North\u2019s local council elections last May, comments made by a Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) candidate, Anne Smyth, sparked an outcry when she said a decision to cancel a \u201ctaster\u201d GAA session at an East Belfast primary school was \u201cjustifiable in view of the sectarian nature of the supposed \u2018sporting\u2019 organisation that is the GAA\u201d. Ms Smyth, who failed in her bid to get elected to the hardline unionist party, cited \u201cGAA expansionism concerns\u201d surrounding the Henry Jones playing fields and criticised East Belfast GAA\u2019s former honorary president Linda Ervine \u201cfor her attempts to persuade east Belfast people to learn Gaelic\u201d. On Sunday, Alliance Party MLA for the area, Peter McReynolds, said those behind the latest security alert have \u201cno regard for anyone in the community, nor do they represent the people of East Belfast\u201d. \u201cEast Belfast GAA has garnered immense praise from our community, and rightly so. Their efforts to unite people through sports is something to be celebrated and promoted,\u201d he said. \u201cYet the club has received a never-ending slew of threats and security alerts. Those behind security alerts like this are not interested in anything positive; instead, they are focused on creating division and destruction. \u201cThey are unwanted in East Belfast or anywhere else, and I would urge anyone with information on this alert to contact police immediately.\u201d East Belfast MP and interim DUP party leader, Gavin Robinson, posted on social media that the incident was \u201csenseless\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Police ... They are grateful to the wider community, impacted once again, for their patience. This is senseless,\u201d he wrote.

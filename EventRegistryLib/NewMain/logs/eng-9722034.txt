Here are links to pages that list cooling centers and other helpful information:\n\nNBC4 Washington asked a doctor to explain the signs of heat-related illness and how to protect yourself.\n\nDr. Rachel Marquez, with Kaiser Permanente, said the signs to look out for include developing muscle cramps, nausea, light headaches and fatigue or dizziness.\n\nHeat-related illnesses including heat stroke, heat exhaustion and heat cramps may occur with long exposure to heat without relief or hydration, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nA heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness and a life-threatening emergency, according to Johns Hopkins. It occurs rapidly when a person's body is unable to properly cool down and can damage the brain and organs. Symptoms include red and dry skin, disorientation, delirium and nausea. If you think someone is suffering from heat stroke, call 911.\n\nHeat exhaustion is less severe, but can turn into heat stroke if not taken seriously. Symptoms include muscle cramps, dizziness, weakness, headaches, nausea, diarrhea and passing out.\n\nIf someone is suffering from either heat illness, you can help them by moving them to a cool, dry place, removing excess clothing, trying to cool them down with a fan or cool cloths and offering them a cool drink (a sports drink containing salt and sugar is recommended for cramps and exhaustion.)\n\nHeat exhaustion \"can develop after several days of exposure to high temperatures and inadequate or unbalanced replacement of fluids,\" the Prince George's County Health Department said.\n\nThe key is hydration. If exercising, Dr. Marquez recommends drinking water before, during and after.\n\nShe said to take extra precautions during high heat periods of the day, typically between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., which can put individuals at an increased risk of developing heat-related illnesses. D.C. often sees some of its hottest temperatures after 4 p.m.\n\n\"One thing that you should remember about heat-related illness is that it can be cumulative,\" she said. \"So, even if you're outside, you're exercising, you're feeling pretty good and you come inside and you can be very commonly feel run down and the heat-related illness can then affect you after that, so it's really important to try and stay on top of hydration.\"\n\nSee below for more tips from the Prince George's County Health Department:\n\nCooling centers are available in D.C., Virginia and Maryland.\n\nIn D.C., free transportation to cooling centers is available by calling 202-399-7093 or 311; find other D.C. resources here.\n\nArlington County is offering shelters and resources during the heat wave.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nA blistering heat wave has smothered the Washington region, claiming seven lives and forcing elected officials to cancel public events, close down athletic fields and encourage residents to stay indoors.\n\nHeat indexes have surpassed 100 degrees over a string of consecutive days this week, prompting the National Weather Service to issue heat alerts for the region on three straight days.\n\nThe heat is predicted to ease somewhat Thursday and Friday before ramping back up over the weekend and next week, setting up another uncomfortable stretch for the region's second-hottest start to the summer on record, according to the Capital Weather Gang.\n\nIn the Washington region, the concern running under the steady drumbeat of public warnings and proclamations is that this week's weather will probably result in more heat-related illness and potential deaths. \"We are encouraging residents to stay hydrated and limit outdoor activities as much as possible,\" Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) said Friday. \"It is also important to check on your family members, friends and neighbors, especially senior citizens, families with young children, people with special needs, or individuals living alone during periods of extreme heat.\"\n\nOf the six reported deaths in Maryland due to heat-related illness, four of the victims were in Prince George's, according to the Maryland Health Department's weekly Heat-Related Illness Surveillance Report. Two of the deceased were between 45 and 64 years old, while two were older than 65.\n\nThe two additional deaths were from Anne Arundel and Baltimore City. According to Maryland's data, nine people died because of heat in 2023.\n\nNext door in Montgomery, Maryland's most populated county, officials said county-run libraries, swimming pools, recreation centers and senior centers would remain open during normal operating hours to serve as places to cool off during the day.\n\nThe county's Department of Transportation will also provide free bottled water on some buses for customers using the Ride On, ExtRa, Flex and Flash bus systems. Homeless shelters will also remain open at all hours. On Wednesday, the Virginia Department of Health confirmed that there had been one recent heat-related death but had no further details. Christian Martinez, a spokesman for Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), said the governor is monitoring the situation statewide.\n\n\"Governor Youngkin continues to engage across multiple secretariats and state agencies actively collaborating with our federal and local partners to assess conditions and provide guidance to Virginians, enabling local governments and families to implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of Virginians across the Commonwealth,\" Martinez said in a written statement. Virginia is bracing for the long-term aftershocks of the heat. Last month, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued a drought warning for the Northern Virginia region -- including the counties of Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, Arlington and Fairfax -- as well as for seven counties in the Shenandoah region. The warning means that a significant heat-related drought is \"imminent,\" according to the advisory.\n\nThe Virginia Drought Monitoring Task Force found that stream flows were at or below 25 percent of normal levels in every region of the state, while groundwater levels were declining in the northern, central and eastern regions. Water levels at monitoring wells were extremely low -- below 5 percent of normal -- in Northern Virginia, Shenandoah, Roanoke, the New River in Southwest and the York-James River area of the Peninsula.\n\nReservoir levels were normal, but the department said it was working on drought response plans with officials around the state. The announcement encouraged residents to \"protect water supplies by minimizing water use, monitoring drought conditions and detecting and repairing leaks.\"\n\nIn the District, which is hosting leaders from around the globe for the NATO summit, police are already working extended 12-hour shifts through the end of this week to maintain road closures and security measures tied to the summit.\n\nD.C. police spokesman Tom Lynch says the heat has not caused the department to cancel any events or change its posture.\n\n\"We are taking great care to get water and cooling opportunities to our officers, particularly those standing on posts surrounding the [NATO] summit. But other than that, our stance remains steady,\" Lynch wrote in a text message. Emma Uber, Jenny Gathright, Jordan Brown, Lateshia Beachum, Jasmine Hilton, Katie Shepherd and Gregory S.

{"id": 232068934, "title": "German exit polls point to far right gains in European election and a weak government showing", "text": "Exit polls pointed to very weak results for Germany's governing parties and gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany in Sunday's vote for the European Parliament, while the mainstream conservative opposition was set to remain the country's strongest political force in the legislature. The polls for ARD and ZDF public television showed support for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats at 14%, below the 15.8% they managed in 2019 and far below their showing in Germany's last national election in 2021. Alternative for Germany, or AfD, was seen winning up to 16.5% of the vote. That\u2019s better than its showing of 11% in 2019 but still some way short of its poll ratings several months ago. The party has seen a string of setbacks this year, including scandals surrounding its two lead candidates for the European Parliament. The polls showed the environmentalist Greens, the second-biggest party in Scholz's coalition, falling from a very successful 20.5% five years ago to around 12%. Support for the pro-business Free Democrats, the third party in the quarrelsome and unpopular government, was seen at 5%. The exit polls gave a clear lead to the center-right Union bloc, now the main opposition force, putting its support at around 30%. That's in line with its 2019 result and better than its showing in the last national election.", "summary": "Exit polls point to very weak results for Germany\u2019s governing parties and gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany in Sunday\u2019s vote for the European Parliament, while the mainstream conservative opposition is set to remain the country\u2019s strongest political force in the legislature", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-european-parliament-olaf-scholz-berlin-support-b2559476.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/17/European_Election_Germany_67487.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:24:34", "author": "Via AP news wire", "authors": ["Via AP news wire"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.032}

He asked about Rachel and showed honest compassion for her untimely death. His words brought comfort to me during this very difficult time.\"\n\nMartinez-Hernandez is accused of killing Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five who was discovered dead along the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail in Bel Air last August, ending what authorities have described as an international crime spree spanning from his native El Salvador to Los Angeles and culminating on the opposite coast in sleepy Harford County.\n\nOperating on FBI intelligence suggesting that he was in Tulsa, Oklahoma, police and federal agents arrested Martinez-Hernandez at a bar there late Friday. Police have credited a DNA analysis called genetic genealogy and a public tip, provided almost a year after Morin's death, with enabling them to close in on their suspect.\n\nWhen announcing the arrest Saturday, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said Martinez-Hernandez entered the country unlawfully and demanded President Joe Biden and federal lawmakers correct what he described as a broken American immigration system, adding fuel to a contentious political debate expected to be at the center of the forthcoming presidential election.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri":

I remember her being like 14 -15 months old, and she's very petite, fair skin, bright orange hair, and she just loved life,\" Rachel's mother, Patricia Morin, told Nancy Grace during Thursday's Crime Stories episode.\n\n\"She loved learning new things. Everything excited her. The excitement wasn't learning, but also she was very sensitive.\"\n\nAs CrimeOnline previously reported, police said Morin was found dead on August 6, 2023, off the Ma and Pa Heritage Trail in Harford County, Maryland. She was found a little over 12 hours after her boyfriend, Richard Tobin, reported her missing when she didn't return from a run.\n\nAfterward, Maryland State Police examined the DNA left at the crime scene and processed it in the CODIS database. The DNA came back as a match for a man under suspicion for breaking into a Los Angeles home and assaulting a young girl in March 2023.\n\nHarford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler said the breakthrough in the case came when DNA evidence uncovered the suspect's identity as Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez. Investigators subsequently tracked Martinez-Hernandez to Oklahoma and obtained an arrest warrant Friday afternoon.\n\nGahler said the suspect crossed into the US illegally in February 2023, a month after he allegedly killed a woman in his home country. While US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed a detainer on him, Gahler said he will face charges in Maryland and California before being deported.\n\nHarford County State's Attorney Alison Healey said her office has initiated the extradition process to bring Martinez-Hernandez back to Maryland, adding that she would \"personally be leading the prosecution of this case.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Patricia says she remembers her daughter as a loving and devoted mother, noting her caring nature and deep affection for her five children.\n\n\"She cared about people. She cared about people's feelings She was very compassionate,\" Patricia continued.\n\n\"She grew up to be just a wonderful woman, balanced. We...I loved her because she had a strong sense of herself. And she didn't have a problem disagreeing with mom because mom's a little older and more traditional than she was.\n\n\"But that's what made her who she was. She knew who she was. She loved her children. She devoted herself to her children. She was a hard worker.\"\n\nMeanwhile, when he's brought back to Maryland, Martinez-Hernandez will face charges of first-degree murder and first-degree rape.\n\nFor the latest true crime and justice news, subscribe to the 'Crime Stories with Nancy Grace' podcast.

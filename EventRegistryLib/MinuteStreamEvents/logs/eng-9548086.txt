Now, he is facing assault charges after allegedly attacking multiple passengers -- with a pair of medical scissors. OMG!!\n\nRelated: Oklahoma Dad Murdered Wife After Argument Then 'Hunted Down' Kids One By One\n\nPer the Alaska-based federal prosecutors, Sogoni was working on a Norwegian Cruise Line vessel that left Seattle, Washington over the weekend and was bound for Juneau, Alaska. It was supposed to shepherd guests through the incredible sights of British Columbia, Alaska, and the Pacific Northwest. But for one vacationing woman and two unfortunate cruise ship employees, it was the scene of a brutal attack.\n\nThe incident began when other cruise ship workers allegedly observed Sogoni trying to release a lifeboat from the side of the ship. They contacted security, and he was escorted to the cruise vessel's medical center. There, he allegedly picked up a pair of medical scissors and attacked multiple people without any provocation whatsoever. The USAO docs state:\n\n\"Upon arrival [to the medical center], Sogoni physically attacked a security guard and a male nurse inside an examination room and proceeded to enter another examination room where a woman, who is a U.S. citizen, was being examined.\"\n\nProsecutors say none of the three provoked Sogoni in any way, and that the violent attack came up out of the blue. The woman was stabbed multiple times, and the other employees were seriously injured, too:\n\n\"He grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed the woman multiple times in the arm, hand and face. He also stabbed two security guards who intervened -- one in the head and one in the back and shoulders.\"\n\nOMG...\n\nSogoni was immediately detained, and for the rest of the cruise, he was held in the ship's jail. When the cruise arrived in Juneau, he was arrested by FBI agents. He has since been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon within a maritime and territorial jurisdiction. Per multiple media outlets, if found guilty of that charge, the South African man faces up to ten years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each assault.\n\nRelated: Man Murdered GF Because She Didn't 'Respect' Him, And Sent Video Of Corpse To Her Ex!\n\nNBC News obtained an arrest affidavit written by FBI Special Agent Matthew Judy which indicated Sogoni had just been hired in Seattle before the cruise left port on May 5. Norwegian Cruise Line also released their own statement on the matter, too, that more or less confirmed the USAO's claims after news of Sogoni's arrest was first revealed:\n\n\"On May 6, 2024, a newly employed crew member was observed exhibiting unusual and irrational behavior. The ship's security team escorted the crew member to the medical center for evaluation and assessment, where he became violent without provocation, attacking two other crew members and a guest. The security team quickly detained him, and the onboard medical staff treated those involved for non-life-threatening injuries.\"\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line confirmed to People that they will \"assist the relevant authorities in the ongoing investigation,\" and continued:\n\n\"The relevant law enforcement authorities were immediately contacted and took custody of the crew member once the ship arrived in Juneau, Alaska. We condemn violent behavior of this nature and are committed to the safety and security of all crew members and guests on our ships. We commend the onboard security team for their brave actions. Senior ship leadership have been actively engaged and continue to closely monitor all involved with the support of senior company executives who immediately traveled to Juneau to meet, escort and assist the guest.\"\n\nWow.

After he was brought to an examination\n\nroom, Sogoni became irrational and attempted to leave. He physically attacked a security\n\nguard and a male nurse,\" the document describes.\n\nHe allegedly then ran into a medical room where a passenger was being treated and stabbed the woman in the arm, hands and face with a pair of scissors. She's described as 75 years old, and her injuries were reportedly non-life-threatening.\n\n\"Security guards intervened and Sogoni stabbed two guards with the scissors before they could subdue and detain him. One guard... a citizen of the Philippines, was stabbed\n\nin the head. The other guard...a citizen of Nepal, was stabbed in the back and shoulder,\" the affidavit reads. The victims were treated for non-lethal injuries.\n\nHe was held in the ship's jail and then arrested in Juneau by the FBI.\n\nWhile the incident is detailed as having happened off Canada, the FBI agent says there is probable cause to believe the criminal act occurred \"within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\"\n\n\"Sogoni is charged with assault with a dangerous weapon within maritime and territorial jurisdiction in violation of 18 USC \u00a7113(a)(3). If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors,\" a release from the United States Attorney's Office reads in part.\n\nDaily Hive has contacted Norwegian Cruise Line for comment and will update this piece if that information becomes available.", "source": {"uri": "dailyhive.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Go ahead and Subscribe here.\n\nAfter less than a week of working and living onboard Norwegian Encore, a crew member has ended his career at sea.\n\nAccording to a release from the U.S. Department of Justice and a criminal affidavit from the FBI, Ntando Sogoni of South Africa was arrested after allegedly attacking multiple people aboard the Breakaway-class ship.\n\nThe incident, which occurred on the morning of Monday, May 6, 2024, took place after the 35-year-old crew member was seen trying to deploy a lifeboat for no clear reason.\n\nMembers of the ship's security team took Sogoni to the onboard medical center to be mentally and physically assessed, where he physically assaulted a security guard and a male nurse inside an examination room.\n\nThe scuffle then moved to another examination room, where Sogoni attacked a 75-year-old woman with a pair of medical scissors, causing injuries to her arm, hand, and face. He then wounded two more security guards who intervened to detain the crew member before he was safely confined in the onboard jail.\n\nWorth Reading: Juneau Cruise Port, Alaska - Overview and Guide\n\nThe victims' names have not been released to protect their privacy, but authorities say the injuries were not life threatening.\n\nThe next morning, on May 7, the crew member was taken into custody by the FBI shortly after the 3,998-guest ship docked in Juneau, Alaska. Sogoni's arrest came just two days after he joined the ship in Seattle, Washington, on Sunday, May 5.\n\nThe FBI charged Sagoni with assault with a dangerous weapon within maritime and territorial jurisdiction. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count. A federal district court judge will determine his sentence at a later date.\n\nFor now, the case is being investigated by the FBI Anchorage Field Office, FBI Juneau Resident Agency, and U.S. Coast Guard. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Schmidt is leading the prosecution.\n\nAlthough events like this are shocking, they are very rare and not typically something to be worried about. While it's always smart to remain aware of one's surroundings, cruise ships are generally quite safe, and usually possess their own onboard security teams and firefighting divisions.\n\nPublic areas are also typically monitored with surveillance cameras, allowing security team members to respond to crises quickly and efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, crew members typically go through an intense interview and training process, which is meant to weed out the bad seeds before they make it onboard. Of the approximately 1,735 crew members onboard Norwegian Encore, only Sogoni posed a problem and he was quickly detained and removed.\n\nIn an interview with KTOO, Juneau's local news station, FBI Public Affairs Officer Chloe Martin confirmed that there is no further danger onboard Norwegian Encore.\n\n\"This was an isolated incident, and there's no threat to other passengers,\" said Martin.\n\nRead Also: Are Cruises Safe? What You Really Need to Know\n\nWith Sogoni removed, the 169,116-gross ton vessel can carry on with its Alaska season. As of the time of publication, no delays or itinerary changes have been announced as a result of the alleged assault.\n\nFrom now until October, Norwegian Encore will be offering 7-night cruises to Juneau, Skagway, Glacier Bay, and Ketchikan in Alaska, as well as Victoria, British Columbia. All sailings are round-trip from Seattle, Washington.", "source": {"uri": "cruisehive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cruise Hive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "catie_kovelman@cruisehive.com", "name":

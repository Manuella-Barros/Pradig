Viewing the group\u2019s 21st year since releasing their debut album Map of the Human Soul as a fresh start akin to their rookie days, Tablo tells Billboard how \u201cour fans call this Epik High\u2019s \u2018+1st Year,'\u201d pointing to a revitalized spirit driving their latest efforts. \u201cIt really does feel like a fresh start after the milestone year we had last year.\u201d In an exclusive Q&A with Billboard following Epik High\u2019s announcement of their PUMP mixtape and accompanying North American tour today, Tablo teases the mixtape\u2019s tracks, an elevated concert experience plus more new music from himself, Mithra Jin and DJ Tukutz. Peep all 23 of Epik High\u2019s The Pump Tour dates in the official poster below and then dive into the full interview for more insights on PUMP and more. Congratulations on the latest mixtape and tour news. After your 20th anniversary, you shared how \u201cit feels like our first year again.\u201d Tell me about the energy in Epik High today. Tablo: Our fans call this Epik High\u2019s \u201c+1st Year.\u201d And it really does feel like a fresh start, after the milestone year we had last year with the stadium show in Seoul and the resulting movie in theaters in quarter one of this year. Artists can feel lost after a milestone because it usually marks the end of an era, but we have somehow managed to make it a new beginning. Our fandom is energized more than ever. What better way to start this \u201cfirst year\u201d than by dropping our very first mixtape, jam-packed with energy reminiscent of our rookie days? It\u2019s time to get our fans pumped all over again. You teased the mixtape tracklist in your announcement. Are there any tracks you\u2019re particularly excited for fans to hear? You have to listen from track one to track nine straight because Epik High\u2019s transitions are the best and this album has the greatest transitions. Also, there are a few songs that are going to generate tons of memes\u2026we have a lot of visual content coming, so I suggest subscribing to our YouTube channel. Epik High has such a wide range of collaborators. What can you tell us about those on the record or behind the scenes? The album is pretty much entirely self-produced, with only one featuring artist. Our core fans will get a lot more Epik High with this one. How will an Epik High mixtape differ from past album or EP projects? The format frees us from having to make radio hits, allowing us to refocus on the irreverent and raw side of Epik High that our core fans love. It also allowed us to make songs that are optimized for live performance. This year\u2019s tour setlist is gonna be amazing. The Epik High All Time High Tour hit Europe and North America last year. What can we look forward to in The Pump Tour? It\u2019ll feel very new, even if you\u2019ve come to every previous show. We are leveling up everything: the production, the merch, you name it. We\u2019ve even revamped the VIP experience so our most dedicated fans can get rare merch and share more personal close-up moments with us. Seriously, don\u2019t miss it. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see Epik High\u2019s brilliant lightstick \u2014 the \u201cPark Kyu Bong\u201d \u2014 on the road. Can you share more about its conceptualization? Any worries it might be banned at certain venues? It\u2019s the lightstick that transcends fandoms, it\u2019s the lightstick you hold if you\u2019re a fan of yourself. On social media, I have seen our lightstick pop up at other artists\u2019 shows and big festivals all over the world. So if a venue blocks it, we will block the venue \u2014 because that venue probably sucks. Tablo, you buy new K-pop acts\u2019 records because you \u201cremember what it was like being a rookie and no one buying my album.\u201d Any recommendations? At the moment, I\u2019ve been so busy with our [music] that I\u2019ve been slacking on my K-pop shopping. I will be visiting a lot of K-pop stores on this tour. While the tour will keep you busy up til nearly October, is there anything else for fans to look forward to with Epik High in 2024? At the end of the tour, we will have another huge show in Seoul. Also\u2026my members are gonna kill me for saying this\u2026but this new album PUMP is not the whole album. Lastly, I have a long awaited song with someone, finished and waiting in my hard drive. That is all I can say.

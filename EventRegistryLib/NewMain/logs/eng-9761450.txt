Unfortunately, the news following tests is not nearly as positive, as Tom Pelissero has reported that Blackmon suffered a torn ACL, meaning his 2024 season is over before it even got started.\n\nBlackmon was the Vikings' third-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft and received several starts towards the end of last season. There were many who were expecting him to take a significant jump this year, including Pro Football Focus, who made Blackmon a part of their \"All-Breakout\" team for this season. As one of the top three corners on the roster, Blackmon was going to be given a much greater workload this season than he had received as a rookie.\n\nWith Blackmon's injury, the battle for spots behind Shaq Griffin and Byron Murphy on the cornerback depth chart will get even more intense. The Vikings could, potentially, look to the free agent market if they want some veteran help. With the way the roster is constructed now, the #3 cornerback spot will likely be filled by Akayleb Evans, with Andrew Booth Jr. and the newly-signed Duke Shelley battling it out behind him.\n\nAbsolutely awful news from the first day of Minnesota Vikings Training Camp, as rising cornerback Mekhi Blackmon is officially done for the season with a torn ACL.

It's a big blow to a position group that was already an area of concern.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBlackmon, a second-year player out of Southern California who showed flashes of promise last season after being drafted in the third round, hurt his knee during a 7-on-7 passing drill. He was tended to by the medical staff for several minutes on the sideline and eventually walked slowly off the field and into the training room for further examination.\n\nBlackmon played in 15 games as a rookie and was a fixture in the team's nickel package. He had one interception, one fumble recovery and eight passes defensed.\n\nThe Vikings are still grieving the death of rookie cornerback Khyree Jackson, who was killed in a car crash along with two friends earlier this month in Maryland. Several coaches are scheduled to attend the funeral on Friday for the fourth-round draft pick out of Oregon.\n\nByron Murphy Jr. is back at one starting spot and eighth-year veteran Shaq Griffin signed as a free agent. But with Blackmon sidelined and the loss of Jackson, the cornerback group appears particularly vulnerable coming off a season when the Vikings' pass coverage faltered down the stretch.\n\nDuke Shelley was signed on Tuesday for depth and experience. Akayleb Evans is back after starting 15 games, but he struggled down the stretch. Andrew Booth Jr., who was from the same underperforming 2022 draft class as Evans, is another option who has yet to prove he can stay healthy and contribute regularly.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL", "source": {"uri": "clickorlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKMG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@clickorlando.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "dave_campbell@clickorlando.com", "name": "Dave Campbell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhi_Blackmon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mekhi Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagan,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eagan, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eagan, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akayleb_Evans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akayleb Evans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Booth_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Booth Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/35HXMBD4WJBD3JNFXGKMVURYBI.jpg?_a=DATAdtfiZAA0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761450", "eventUri": "eng-9761450", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eagan, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

For him, in his second year, and the team in general,\" Lewis posted on X on July 24.\"\n\nBlackmon was the No. 102 overall pick by the Vikings in the 2023 draft.

Booth allowed QBs to complete 84.6% of those targets as a rookie.\n\nMinnesota also lost rookie fourth-round draft pick Khyree Jackson, who The Oregonian's James Crepea reported was killed in a car accident on July 6.

Last year, he notched 41 total tackles (34 solo, seven assisted), one fumble recovery, one interception, and eight pass deflections for the 7-10 Vikings.\n\nMinnesota missed the playoffs, though a pair of Blackmon's fellow defenders were named Pro Bowl starters -- outside linebacker Danielle Hunter and left safety Andrew DePaolo, the latter of whom was also an Associated Press All-Pro honoree.\n\nThe Vikings' 2023 record was a far cry from its encouraging 13-4 2022 run. The team began its year a miserable 1-4, before a string of five straight victories made them competitive in their division once again, at 6-4. Unfortunately, by the end of that run even the Vikings knew their postseason prospects were looking bleak. That's because four-time Pro Bowl starting quarterback Kirk Cousins ruptured his Achilles tendon during a Week 8 matchup against fellow NFC North squad the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe injury to Blackmon is just the latest in a string of indignities incurred by Minnesota this summer. Star wide receiver Jordan Addison was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. The Vikings' depth behind Blackmon also took a tragic hit this summer. Rookie cornerback Khyree Jackson, selected with the No. 108 pick out of the University of Oregon in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft, passed away in a car accident.\n\nMore News: Vikings Plan to Honor Khyree Jackson in Special Way for 2024 NFL Season\n\nBlackmon, 25, enjoyed a well-traveled collegiate career, following an impressive run at Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, California. The 5-foot-11, 178-pound corner spent the 2017 NCAA season plying his trade for community college the College of San Mateo, then transferred to Colorado, where he played from 2018-21.\n\nBlackmon finally latched on with the Cardinal and Gold in 2022, during Lincoln Riley's first year with the school. The Trojans went 11-3 in future Chicago Bears No. 1 draft pick Caleb Williams' Heisman Trophy-winning season. USC fell in its subsequent bowl game that season, the 2023 Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic, losing to Tulane 46-45.\n\nIn an All-Pac-12 season, Blackmon recorded 66 total tackles (45 solo, 21 assisted), one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, three interceptions for 31 total yards, and 13 pass deflections.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors":

He was tended to by the medical staff for several minutes on the sideline and eventually walked slowly off the field and into the training room for further examination.\n\nBlackmon played in 15 games as a rookie and was a fixture in the team's nickel package.

He made 41 total tackles, broke up eight passes, had one interception and one fumble recovery.\n\nPro Football Focus gave Blackmon one of the best grades of the season for rookie defensive backs, and he emerged as a valuable member of the secondary after entering the league as a third round pick.\n\nThe Vikings are looking to improve on defense after a frustrating season on that side of the ball.\n\nMinnesota had the 24th best pass defense in the NFL last season, allowing 234.5 yards per game and 23 passing touchdowns. They were in the top ten against the run, allowing fewer than 100 yards per game and only 14 rushing touchdowns.\n\nThe Vikings are also entering a new era without Kirk Cousins, who chose to join the Atlanta Falcons in free agency. They selected Michigan's JJ McCarthy in the first round of the NFL Draft to replace him, and they'll figure out if the national title winner is ready to lead an NFL franchise.\n\nBlackmon's injury is devastating, and it's hopefully one of only a few significant injuries that we see this year during training camp and the preseason.\n\nRelated: Video Of Travis Kelce Shoving Teammate At Practice Goes Viral", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kameron_duncan@postandcourier.com", "name": "Kameron Duncan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761450", "eventUri": "eng-9761450", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Rich Barnes-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe injury bug appears to have gotten the Minnesota Vikings in record time.\n\nKevin Seifert of ESPN reported Wednesday that Vikings cornerback Mekhi Blackmon suffered a torn ACL during the opening practice of training camp. Blackmon apparently sustained the injury during the 7-on-7 portion of practice, Seifert adds.\n\nWednesday marked the start of training camp for the Vikings and several other NFL teams. Seifert notes that Minnesota was hoping that Blackmon could be a potential starter for them this season in their nickel defense.\n\nBlackmon, 25, was a third-round pick out of USC in 2023. He made 15 total appearances for the Vikings last season (three of them starts) and logged 41 combined tackles, nine passes defended, and a fumble recovery.\n\nMinnesota was already reeling after the death of rookie cornerback Khyree Jackson in a car accident earlier this month. With Blackmon (albeit under very different circumstances) now out for the year as well, the Vikings are facing a lot of uncertainty in their secondary heading into the new season.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highmark_Stadium_(New_York)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Highmark Stadium (New York)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard_Park_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orchard Park (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orchard Park (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhi_Blackmon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mekhi Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nickel defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vikings-helmet.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761450", "eventUri": "eng-9761450", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-08-29", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 459573540, "relevance": 2}

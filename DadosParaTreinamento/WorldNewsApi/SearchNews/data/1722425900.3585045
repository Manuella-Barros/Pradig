It hurts and it makes me angry, and I think he has some questions to answer,\u201d Sunak told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t repeat those words lightly, I do so deliberately because this is too important not to call out clearly for what it is,\u201d he added. Farage initially said he that he was dismayed by the language used when the comments were first broadcast on Thursday. But on Friday he suggested, without providing evidence, that Parker was an actor involved in \u201ca political setup\u201d to undermine Reform during the election. Asked during a television debate when he would accept some responsibility, Farage said: \u201cI am not going to apologise ... it is a setup, a deliberate attempt to smear us.\u201d", "summary": "Nigel Farages said he was dismayed by the language but later said the volunteer was an actor involved in \u201ca political setup\u201d to undermine his party.", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/rishi-sunak-hurt-and-angry-over-reform-volunteer-s-racial-slur-20240629-p5jpr8.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2507%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_282%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/144e567fa4e8350359ab481d750cc675bdcd3429", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:12:38", "author": "Alistair Smout and Andrew MacAskill", "authors": ["Alistair Smout and Andrew MacAskill"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": -0.271}

Following a third-round score of 73, McIlroy finds himself tied for the 11th spot, eight shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler as they head into the final day. Though topping the leaderboard seems improbable for the man from Holywood, the four-time major champion could possibly pocket an impressive sum for his efforts throughout the week.

McIlroy is guaranteed to rake in $556,000 with a top-10 finish and should he climb to the top-four, the 35 year old will be richer by at least $1 million, reports the Irish Mirror. Off the green, McIlroy shared his thoughts with journalists regarding the ongoing deliberations over a possible merger between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf. He said: \"Yeah, very productive, very constructive, very collaborative. I think those are probably three words I would use to describe it (the meeting). Yeah, it was really good. Definitely things are heading in the right direction. A lot of progress was made. I can't really say much more than that, but it was really positive.\" McIlroy added: \"So the meeting with PIF was three hours, but then the prep call before that was an hour and a half, so probably, like, four and a half hours. I would say - maybe not surprised, but maybe more encouraged. I think a lot of progress had sort of been made. But, yeah, definitely encouraged. \"In terms of the deal, like the financials and the legal and all that, I think more that was -- those three calls a week were more to do with, like, their investment committee and SSG, so that was more - that's what those calls were. \"But I think last night was more, you know, talking about the future of the game and the vision and that was where I thought there was a lot of progress that was made.\" Both Shane Lowry and Seamus Power are also looking at potential windfalls as they currently rank among the top-20.

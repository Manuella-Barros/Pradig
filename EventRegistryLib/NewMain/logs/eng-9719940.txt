Plus centre court in 4K UHD on Stan Sport, the home of grand slam tennis\n\nJust 22 months after announcing she was putting down the racquet, Clijsters returned to the competitive circuit with her first child and targeted US Open success.\n\nShe went on to claim back-to-back victories at the tournament, defeating the likes of Marion Bartoli, Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki.\n\n\"To have Ash playing the legends [doubles] with Casey is fun,\" Clijsters said on Stan Sport's Grand Slam Daily.\n\n\"A few years ago, I was the youngest legend out there, but I'm definitely not anymore.\n\n\"It's cool, and who knows [what it might lead to]?\n\n\"Last year, seeing Caroline Wozniacki [who returned post-pregnancy] practice in between our legends matches, we were all like, 'What are you doing? Why are you practising this much?'\n\n\"There is definitely a part of me that hopes she gets triggered by the challenge and the adventure that it is to come back on tour with a family, but I don't know. I haven't heard anything about it.\"\n\nDespite Barty remaining adamant she will not come out of retirement, Clijsters said she, too, never intended to return professionally again after having a child. She said training for exhibition matches triggered her desire.\n\n\"I do understand probably because I was also young when I retired the first time, and I didn't think I'd ever come back when I stopped playing,\" Clijsters said.\n\n\"Nobody can really feel or understand what it's like to be from such a young age, (being) looked at as this huge talent, with the expectation and pressure.\n\n\"It gets easier to deal with it and you kind of turn off all the outside influences as you get older, but it will be interesting. I hope I get to play against her and have a chat and try to figure some stuff out.\"\n\n2005 Australian Open quarter-finalist Alicia Molik said there was \"no doubt\" Barty would still be collecting major titles had she remained on the tour.\n\n\"We want a revival, but at the same time, we have been pretty blessed with what Ash Barty delivered us,\" Molik said.\n\n\"If you look back at it, it was all condensed in a three, three-and-a-half-year period, so it's hard to replicate that immediately.\n\n\"We all want someone to have that same success, but she might be a once-in-a-generation player.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure we'll see anyone with that kind of class, poise, and ability to hit her straps quite quickly after returning to the tour, and winning slams - she had an amazing ability as a tennis player.\"\n\nDellacqua was also confident her long-time doubles partner could still dominate on the court, but the Aussie tennis great also noted the lack of time Barty currently has to fully commit to a return to the sport.\n\n\"The Wimbledon dream is embedded in us as kids. For Ash, the Wimbledon win was really special,\" Dellacqua said on Grand Slam Daily.\n\n\"It's probably the one that she wanted to win the most, and you can see that in terms of how much it meant to her, so I think to be a winner and champion, for Ash was something she had always dreamed about... and the stars aligned that year with it obviously being Evonne Goolagong [Cawley]'s 50th [anniversary of her 1971 Wimbledon win].\n\n\"She's playing really well [in preparation for the invitational event]. She's feeling good, she's excited but she's a busy girl this week. She's (had) a lot of commitments, on top of being a parent.

New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nBut Clijsters, whose successful return to tennis was triggered by an initial block of training for exhibitions, pondered whether Barty might get the bug again having returned to the site where she matched the deeds of her idol Evonne Goolagong in 1971 three years ago.\n\nThe former world No.1, who was dubbed \"Aussie\" Kim when dating Lleyton Hewitt, pointed out that 2018 Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki used the 2023 Legends event as a springboard for an impressive comeback to the tour in the United States last year.\n\n\"It sounds very similar to me a few years ago, many years ago I should say now, but it's exciting. I never got to play against her but I practised against her before, so it's exciting to have her playing on the Legends tour,\" Clijsters said.\n\n\"To have Ash playing the Legends is cool. It's fun. And who knows? Last year seeing Caroline Wozniacki practice in between our Legends matches, we were all like, 'What are you doing? Why are you practising this much?'\n\n\"So there's definitely a part of me that hopes that she kind of gets triggered by the challenge and the adventure that it is to come back on tour with a family, but ... I haven't heard anything about it.\"\n\nOn the eve of Wimbledon, Barty's long-term coach Craig Tyzzer said he was intrigued when she called him recently to ask whether he was available for a training block. But when he learned it was only for the Wimbledon Legends doubles, his heart began beating again.\n\n\"I was up in Brisbane not long ago and she said, 'Are you bringing your racquets?\" he told the Tennis Australia website.\n\n\"I said, 'Why?' and she said, 'I want to hit a few balls'. I thought, 'OK. That's interesting'. (But then) I told her I don't think we need a training week for that.\n\n\"With Ash, you never know, but she's pretty adamant she's never coming back. The last time she came back, it was the competitive stuff that she missed, but she is super busy with (her son) Hayden and family is now her goal. She is enjoying that immensely.\"\n\nBarty broke the news of her retirement in March, 2022, in a chat with Dellacqua, who has enjoyed hitting the courts with her as they prepare for the Legends event this week.\n\n\"She's playing really well. She's feeling good, she's excited and she's a busy girl this week,\" Dellacqua said.\n\n\"She's (had) a lot of commitments as well. On top of obviously being a parent - I'm kid free, so I'm just living my best life - but she's got a lot of commitments.\"\n\nClijsters said the decision to make a comeback was a very personal thing that required complete commitment.\n\n\"I do understand, probably because I was also young when I retired the first time, and I didn't think I'd ever come back when I stopped playing,\" she said.\n\n\"Nobody ... can really feel or understand what it's like to be from such a young age, (when you are) looked at as this huge talent, with the expectation and the pressure and stuff.\n\n\"It gets easier to deal with it and you kind of turn off all the outside influences off as you get older, but it will be interesting. But I don't know if she has any desire. I hope I get to play against her and have a chat and try to figure some stuff out.\"\n\nAfter a recent final in Birmingham, Barty's former Australian teammate Ajla Tomljanovic quipped that she had heard the Legends were pissed about the 2019 Roland Garros champion playing at Wimbledon given she was a dominant force on the tour just two years ago.\n\nFormer US Open champion Sam Stosur laughed when quizzed about it on Tuesday in London and noted the 28-year-old's relative youth compared to the rest of the field.\n\n\"No (I'm not pissed off about it) but she must be the youngest legend ever to play, right? (She is) not even 30. I mean, at least I'm 40 now, so I've kind of got over that hill,\" she said.\n\n\"Look, obviously it is a real privilege to come back here and play and if you get the opportunity, you take it.\"\n\nWhile Australia's women have failed to fire in grand slams this year, they have again qualified for the Billie Jean King Cup finals in Spain in November.\n\nAsked if she might take the chance to whisper in the ear of Barty, who has earned rave reviews for her performance as a pundit for the BBC, the first-year Australian captain Stosur said she would be happy to have the former world No.1 involved in any capacity.\n\n\"I don't know (whether) she wants to be a cheerleader, but obviously Ash has got so much to give, whether it is on or off the court in mentoring or coaching, whatever it might be,\" Stosur said.\n\n\"So if she wants to be involved, I certainly wouldn't hinder that process. She has got a lot to give. She is a champion of the sport, an Australian hero in tennis terms, so we'll see where things go.\"\n\nStosur, on a hypothetical basis, said she had no doubt the three-time major champion would be highly competitive if she decided to return to the sport over the next couple of years.\n\n\"Absolutely. She'd be competitive straight away. But you've still got to work. It's not easy just to come back,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we've seen that with the likes of a Wozniacki, (Angelique) Kerber, those two who have come back, it hasn't just been plain sailing straight to the top of the sport.\n\n\"Tennis moves very quickly and when you're not in it, it's amazing how quickly it does go, but I have no doubt if Ash put in the work, especially on a surface like this, she's got shots and elements to her game that not many players have that can cause so much trouble.\n\n\"Hypothetically speaking here, she left when she was at the top and I don't see why, a couple of years later with work behind her, why it wouldn't be happening again.\"\n\nDellacqua, who reached the final of every major with Barty and was to partner her against Andrea Petkovic and Magdalena Rybarikova on Tuesday until their match was cancelled because of rain, agrees.\n\n\"There is no doubt if she wanted to, at 28 years of age, if she put the work in, 100 per cent,\" she said.\n\n\"Absolutely. But you also have got to put the work in. You have to respect it. There is no doubt that if she trained and played, she would be at the top of the game.\"\n\nFormer Billie Jean King Cup captain Alicia Molik is also part of the Legends event and said she hoped Barty's legacy would be to create a new generation of Aussie stars.\n\n\"We want a revival, but at the same time, we have been pretty blessed with what Ash Barty delivered us,\" Molik said.\n\n\"If you look back at it, it was all condensed in a three, three-and-a-half-year period, so it's really hard to replicate that immediately. We all want someone to have that same success, but she also might be a once-in-a-generation player.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure we'll see anyone with that kind of class and poise, but also her ability to hit her straps quite quickly after returning to the tour, winning slams quickly - an amazing ability as a tennis player, she had.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

She plans to stay retired.\n\n\"You guys are killing me,\" Barty told journalists. \"Anyone have a thesaurus for a word that I can use for 'no?'\"\n\nBarty played an invitation doubles match on Centre Court three years to the day after she beat Karolina Pliskova for the Wimbledon title.\n\nThe Australian's return to the All England Club naturally sparked questions about whether she would come back.\n\nNot interested, she said. A year ago, Barty gave birth to a baby boy. She's also doing commentary for the BBC's coverage of Wimbledon.\n\n\"I've got a beautiful commentary box on both Centre and Court 1,\" she said. \"You get a good view and are able to absorb what's happening out on the court. Hopefully people at home are enjoying what I'm having to say. I don't know whether I'm right, wrong or indifferent, but I'm enjoying it as well.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old Barty said she doesn't ponder what would have been had she stayed on tour to battle Iga Swiatek for the No. 1 ranking.\n\n\"I really enjoy watching others do well,\" she said. \"We have seen Iga dominate for the most part of the last two and a half years. She's been incredible the way she has composure, has gone on incredible runs, winning matches and really dominating, which is hard to do.

All About Garry Kissick", "body": "Australian tennis player Ashleigh Barty married her husband in 2022\n\nAustralian tennis star Ashleigh Barty shocked the sporting world when she retired at just 25 years old after winning Wimbledon.\n\nAt the time, she said she wanted to \"chase other dreams.\" The news came just months before she married longtime love Garry Kissick, whom she referred to as \"cheeky and caring\" in an Instagram post dedicated to him.\n\n\"I think it's important I get to enjoy the next phase of my life as Ash Barty the person, not Ash Barty the athlete,\" she said of her decision to retire. Although her professional career is over, Kissick and Barty stay active by playing his favorite sport: golf.\n\nIn July 2023, the couple welcomed their son Hayden. When she isn't writing children's books, Barty often shares about her family of three and their son's milestones.\n\nSo, who is Ashleigh Barty's husband? Here's everything to know about Garry Kissick and his relationship with the former tennis star.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn, Kissick attended Ipswich Grammar School in Queensland until 2007 and then took a three-year course in applied horticulture at Brisbane North Institute of Tafe.\n\nHe now lives with Barty in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nKissick got his start in the golf industry in 2005 at the pro shop at Brookwater Golf and Country Club in Brisbane.\n\nHe advanced to working as a greenskeeper and irrigation technician, using his horticulture education, before becoming a PGA Trainee Professional at the club in 2018.\n\nBarty and Kissick welcomed their son Hayden in early July 2023.\n\n\"Our beautiful boy \u2764\ufe0f Welcome to the world, Hayden!\" the couple wrote on Instagram shortly after his arrival.\n\nA year after Hayden's birth, Barty shared a photo of herself, her son and her former doubles partner Casey Dellacqua on the tennis court. \"Back in my favourite place with my favourite partner(s),\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nKissick was often spotted at Barty's matches during her career. He even supported her on the road during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite knowing it would require him to quarantine with Barty for two weeks upon his return to Australia.\n\n\"It's a test of your relationship, being with each other for two weeks straight,\" she told Vogue in 2022 about their isolation experience. \"Some days it was good where we had each other.\"\n\nKissick has also praised her tennis achievements on social media.\n\n\"So grateful to be a part of your journey so far and proud of everything you've achieved here at Wimbledon. Living out your dreams!\" he wrote on Instagram after she won the tennis championship.\n\nWhile Kissick is an avid athlete, tennis wasn't at the top of his interests before connecting with Barty.\n\n\"When we met he didn't know a lot about tennis,\" she said in an interview with Vogue. \"He's kind of been thrown in the very deep end in understanding what the tour is like and how much we're apart ... [But] he's the best person to have around in the sense of switching off from tennis and being able to bring the fun and laughter when we are training and not be so serious all the time.\"\n\nBarty added, \"I certainly wouldn't want to share this journey with anyone else.\"\n\nThe couple are dog lovers -- they have two Maltese shih tzus and a Border collie, who figure prominently on both of their Instagrams.\n\n\"First swim feels \ud83d\udca6 Team getting ready for Summer \ud83d\udc36\u2600\ufe0f,\" Barty captioned a video of Kissick and their dogs.\n\nKissick has also shared his love for their pets with his followers. \"Happy Birthday to the No.1 dog mum @ashbarty We all miss you but the puppies do enjoy the relaxed house rules while you're away \ud83d\ude18\u2764,\" he wrote in 2021.\n\nBarty and Kissick have seen the world together throughout the course of her tennis career. In 2019, they posted a picture snuggled up in front of the Coliseum in Rome.\n\nKissick also shared a photo of the two enjoying some alone time in a rooftop pool while traveling in Asia. \"Bye Singapore, it was a blast. Thank you @ashbar96 for an amazing week!\" he wrote in the caption.\n\nKissick learned a lot about tennis after meeting Barty, but the Grand Slam winner also prioritizes her husband's interests.

(It was) a lovely surprise to be able to go out on Centre Court. I thought I'd played my last match out there,\" she said.\n\n\"For Casey and I, it was nice to resurrect our last match we played together on Centre Court. It was beautiful out there this evening. I think everyone enjoyed. We had a good time.\n\n\"It's a beautiful court. It's, in my opinion, the best court in the world. I was very grateful and very fortunate that we were able to share an experience out there again today together.\"\n\nBarty had beaten Petkovic, a former top 10-ranked rival, 6-3 6-1 in the 3rd Rd in Paris in 2019 on route to her first grand slam title at Roland Garros and performed with remarkable distinction in a drought-breaking Australian Open success in 2022.\n\nBut Wimbledon was the title she dreamt of while growing up hitting tennis balls against a brick wall in the garage of her parents house in Ipswich while inspired by the deeds of Australian icon Evonne Goolagong-Cawley.\n\nHer success in 2021, which was a miracle on grass given she entered Wimbledon under a massive injury cloud after tearing a thigh muscle during the French Open, came 50 years after her idol's success at Wimbledon and she wore a dress to honour Goolagong-Cawley.\n\n\"It changed so much in my life. It was my dream. It was my childhood dream to win this tournament, to win The Championships,\" she said.\n\n\"I was able to do that. I was fortunate enough to be in a position to play on such a beautiful court on a Saturday afternoon that every athlete wants to play (and) it was really nice to go out there today and reminisce a little bit.\n\n\"Obviously there have been a few changes around here over the last two or three years. But it's nice to come in and settle in like everyone else. It was really enjoyable to go out there.\n\n\"It feels very different when you're under the microscope in a singles final to when you're out there with your best mate. Both enjoyable, but both very different.\"\n\nBarty, who has spent some time since her retirement helping aspiring Australian players, was a little rusty and not quite as sharp as when she was the dominant woman in the world.\n\nAlthough the pace of play was a couple of clicks slower - and that is being generous - the class of the Australian stood out and there was still some brilliant tennis played.\n\nOne angled backhand volley in particular when at full-stretch in the second set drew gasps from a crowd clearly appreciative to watch a master on grass back on the court.\n\nThis is scarcely surprising, for as outstanding as the world No. 1 was on the singles court, she was also a magnificent doubles player who claimed the 2018 US Open with Victoria Azarenka.\n\nShe and Dellacqua also reached three grand slam doubles finals in 2013 when Barty was still in high school and another in 2017 when she was on the comeback trail.\n\nThere were laughs - the three-time major winner sledged the German for her dancing after Petkovic mimed being hurt when struck by a return - while some members of the crowd sang \"c'mon Barty, let's go party\" as the Aussie pair edged ahead in the second set.\n\nBarty returned to the main press room after the win and quipped this \"was not what she had signed up for\". But she is enjoying her new life as a mother and occasional analyst who can walk onto the court and still wow the crowds with her brilliance.\n\n\"It's been new. It's been something I've never done before, obviously dipping my toe in on the commentary side of the fence,\" she said.\n\n\"It's been really enjoyable to work with the BBC. I've worked with some of the best in our game in that respect. I've learnt a lot and have really enjoyed watching live tennis again.\n\n\"I've got a beautiful commentary box on both Centre and Court 1 and you get a good view and are able to absorb what's happening out on the court.\n\n\"Hopefully people at home are enjoying what I'm having to say. I don't know whether I'm right, wrong or indifferent, but I'm enjoying it as well.\"\n\nWith her press conference commitments completed, Barty bolted for the door with a smile and a wave vowing never to do another one.

Obviously, this is the place that holds some of my most cherished memories, and it's really nice to be back with my best mate on the court. It's pretty special,\" said the 28-year-old.\n\nAsked about learning late of her move to Centre Court, she said: \"Yeah, it was a big surprise. It was a very nice surprise. I was making lunch for my son at our house when I got an email come through saying we'd been shifted to Centre.\n\n\"I called Casey straight away and said, 'This is a bit different to what we signed up for!' But we were excited.\n\n\"It's a beautiful court. It's, in my opinion, the best court in the world. I was very grateful and very fortunate that we were able to share an experience out there again today together.\n\nYet there was a poignancy in watching this most masterful of players playing at half-pace in an arena two-thirds empty on the three-year anniversary of her triumph over Karolina Pliskova, a day when she delivered a tennis masterclass for the world to enjoy.\n\nOne volley from Barty in particular - an exquisitely, acutely-angled backhand that skimmed across the net from one side of the court to the other to earn the biggest cheer from the sparse crowd - proved the most shining reminder of that rarest of talents that made her world No.1 just two years ago before her shock retirement.\n\nEven if she's made it abundantly clear there'll be no proper competitive comeback, still the winning mentality is there as she upped her game in the deciding champions' tiebreak to make sure her return was a winning one.\n\nBut when a reporter asked her later about when she was going to make her real return to tennis, she quickly put him right with a flowing backhand.\n\n\"You guys are killing me. I don't know how much more. Anyone have a thesaurus for a word that I can use for 'no'?\" she sighed.\n\n\"No, mate. No, I'm not.\"\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashleigh_Barty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ashleigh Barty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Maleeva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magdalena Maleeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Petkovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Petkovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol\u00edna_Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-15312856/706dda7e5db4e3f7a38aca3a6cd034c47c3ecd5b-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719940", "eventUri": "eng-9719940", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

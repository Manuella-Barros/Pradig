AUKUS was formed in 2021 to counterbalance China's growing power. A first \"pillar\" involves cooperation between the three partners to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, but they have raised the possibility of other countries joining a second pillar to develop other high-tech weaponry.

AUKUS is reaching out to Japan, to find some collaboration that we can do out there.\" Ad Break Coming Up NEXT StayNext OffEnglish 180p288p360p480p540p576p720pHD1080pHDAuto (180p) About ConnatixV504780 About ConnatixV504780 1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE \"I don't think Congress would consider it (AUKUS) open for expansion, but AUKUS partners can certainly reach out and do collaboration out there,\" he said. AUKUS still has to overcome hurdles from strict U.S. restrictions on sharing technology, and Canberra and London worry it could get bogged down if new members are added too quickly. There has been some hesitation about involving Japan, with officials and experts highlighting its cyber and information security vulnerabilities. At the end of April, the U.S. State Department unveiled a plan to reduce licensing requirements for transferring military gear and sensitive technology among AUKUS partners. It said on April 19 it expects to finalize trade exemptions for AUKUS in the next 120 days.

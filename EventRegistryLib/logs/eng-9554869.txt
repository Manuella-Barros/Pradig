While still in high school, he joined a garage band called the Bounty Hunters alongside his friend and future MC5 bandmate Wayne Kramer on guitar.\n\nKramer co-founded MC5 with fellow guitarist Fred \"Sonic\" Smith in 1963, with Thompson joining the group a few years later to fill out the classic lineup alongside vocalist Rob Tyner and bassist Michael Davis.\n\nThompson remained with MC5 through their first breakup in 1972, playing on the group's only two studio albums, 1970's Back in the USA and 1971's High Time.\n\nDespite never achieving mainstream success, MC5 had a tremendous impact on the Detroit rock scene, paving the way for bands like The Stooges and The White Stripes.\n\nOutside of MC5, Thompson manned the kit for LA supergroup The New Order and Australia's New Race (formed with Ron Asheton of The Stooges and members of Radio Birdman).

He was 75.\n\nAn exact cause of death was not given, though Thompson had reportedly suffered a series of medical issues in recent months, including a heart attack in April.\n\nThompson's death comes just a few months after the February death of his MC5 bandmate, guitarist Wayne Kramer, and the April death of John Sinclair, the group's manager. A few months after Sinclair's death, it was announced that the MC5 would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Musical Excellence Award, and Thompson was determined to make the induction ceremony, even after his heart attack.\n\nBecky Tyner, widow of MC5 singer Rob Tyner (who died in 1991), recalled Thompson's reaction to the Rock Hall News -- \"It's about fucking time!\" -- adding, \"Dennis was thrilled with it, so excited and happy. He just wanted to get home to his cat, Annie, and was optimistic about recovering.\"\n\nThompson was born into a musical family, his mother a singer and his father an upright bass player. As he recalled in a 1998 interview, he started playing drums when he was four, and by the time he was nine, he was playing alongside his brother on guitar and sister on piano. Thompson met his future MC5 bandmates in high school in the early Sixties, and the group came of age and cut their teeth in the thick of Detroit's garage rock heyday.\n\nThe MC5 rose to prominence playing left-wing rallies in Detroit and cut their classic debut, the live album Kick Out the Jams, in October 1968. After that, the band released just two studio albums, 1970's Back in the USA and 1971's High Times, before breaking up in 1972. The group's acrimonious split was fueled in part by differing political visions, money, and clashes with Sinclair, but Thompson also acknowledged that his struggles with heroin addiction were a factor as well.\n\nDespite their short run, the MC5 were wildly influential. Thompson's drumming was particularly singular, his powerful, spitfire thwacks earning him the nickname \"Machine Gun,\" even as he anchored his playing in classic rock and roll tenets. \"You had to have the groove,\" he told Modern Drummer (in an interview archived on his website). \"You had to roll with the rock. You had to have propulsion and a smattering of explosive trick licks. You had to lead the beat ever so slightly creating what many used to call 'drive.'\"\n\nKramer, in an 2017 interview posthumously published this year in Spin, called Thompson \"one of the most formidable percussionists,\" adding: \"He was the guy who was able to put a lot of thinking together on the drums that no one else had put together, you know? He listened to Sun Ra and Elvin Jones. He listened to Charlie Watts, Keith Moon and Mitch Mitchell. He was able to put these things together in a way that no one else had done before, and to take it further than certainly rock drummers had ever taken it. He had the ability to play outside of time, which was just genius in my opinion.\"\n\nIn the decades after the MC5 split, Thompson played with a variety of other bands, including two with the Stooges' Ron Asheton, the New Order, and New Race. In 1992, the MC5 reunited for the first time since their split. In the early 2000s, Thompson, Kramer, and bassist Michael Davis embarked on a world tour under the moniker DKT/MC5. This group continued to play regularly up through Davis' death in 2012.\n\nWhile Kramer was the main anchor for future MC5 tours, Thompson was frequently game to sit in on select dates. He also played drums on Heavy Lifting, a new MC5 album that Kramer revealed in 2023, but still hasn't received an official release date. The LP was produced by Bob Ezrin ad also featured contributions from Tom Morello, Don Was, Vernon Reid and Slash.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"},

The rocker had been rehabilitating there following a heart attack suffered in April.\n\nIn a 2018 post on his website, Thompson recalled catching \"the bug for playing music\" when he was just 13 years old. \"My parents were disappointed that I chose the band over school but they supported my decision,\" the rocker wrote. \"Who would know what fate had in store for me. If my parents ever thought I would wind up on a high performance search and destroy team as the MC5, I think my drums might have magically disappeared one night.\"\n\nREAD MORE: How MC5 Started a Revolution With 'Kick Out the Jams'\n\nThompson became a member of MC5 in 1965, joining the classic lineup which included singer Rob Tyner, guitarists Wayne Kramer and Fred \"Sonic\" Smith and bassist Michael Davis. Thompson was the last surviving member of the group - Tyner and Smith died in the '90s, Davis passed in 2012, and Kramer and the band's longtime manager John Sinclair died earlier this year.\n\nGiven the nickname \"Machine Gun\" because of his aggressive style of playing, Thompson was pivotal to MC5's sound. The influential proto-punk group released a pair of studio albums in the '70s, both of which Thompson played on. He also contributed to their groundbreaking 1969 LP Kick Out the Jams, as well as many further live releases. Thompson also reportedly played on two tracks for MC5's yet-to-be-released final album, Heavy Lifting.\n\nIn April, MC5 was announced as inductees for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class. Thompson, who was recovering in the hospital at the time, was reportedly delighted by the honor and declared \"It's about fucking time!\" when the announcement was made.\n\n\"Dennis was thrilled with it, so excited and happy,\" Becky Tyner, widow of MC5 vocalist Rob Tyner, recalled. \"He just wanted to get home to his cat, Annie, and was optimistic about recovering.\"", "source": {"uri": "ultimateclassicrock.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ultimate Classic Rock"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_irwin@ultimateclassicrock.com", "name": "Corey Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Thompson_(drummer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Thompson (drummer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC5", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MC5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Davis_(bassist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Davis (bassist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Kramer_(guitarist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Kramer (guitarist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_Out_the_Jams_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kick Out the Jams (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Tyner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Tyner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_\"Sonic\"_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred \"Sonic\" Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sinclair_(poet)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Sinclair (poet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bass guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-punk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proto-punk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2024/05/attachment-Dennis-Thompson.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554869", "eventUri": "eng-9554869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

He was 75.\n\nThompson passed away at MediLodge of Taylor, where he had been rehabilitating following a heart attack in April.\n\nThe drummer, a longtime Southgate resident, was still at Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital during his initial recovery when he got word April 21 that the MC5 was headed into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nHis first reaction, according to Becky Tyner, widow of MC5 vocalist Rob Tyner: \"It's about f------ time!\" He told Tyner he was eager to make October's induction ceremony in Cleveland.\n\n\"Dennis was thrilled with it, so excited and happy,\" said Becky Tyner. \"He just wanted to get home to his cat, Annie, and was optimistic about recovering.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThompson was the last surviving member of the band, preceded in death by singer Rob Tyner, guitarist Fred (Sonic) Smith, bassist Michael Davis and guitarist Wayne Kramer. The group's former manager, John Sinclair, died April 2.\n\nThompson was a Lincoln Park High School graduate whose first big musical venture came with a teen garage band called the Bounty Hunters, with his friend Kramer on guitar.\n\n\"The (school) tried to boot me because my hair was a quarter-inch over my ears,\" he told the Detroit Free Press in 2003. \"But they didn't end up doing it because I was in the National Honor Society with an A-minus average.\"\n\nHe joined the fledgling MC5 in 1965 at the urging of Kramer, during a time when the rock climate in Detroit was \"kinetic,\" as Thompson called it. He credited the band's rise to its blue-collar work ethic and tight musical chops honed through constant woodshedding.\n\nMore:John Sinclair, Detroit poet, cannabis activist and counterculture icon, dead at 82\n\n\"We thought we were a good band and were on our way. The band liked to rehearse -- everybody loved to play,\" Thompson recounted. \"We loved what we were doing. It was fast cars, hanging out at the drag strip. It was the best way to break away from the system where you went straight to a factory if you didn't go to college.\"\n\nThompson's hard-pounding style at the kit was born of necessity during the MC5's early years around Detroit, he explained:\n\n\"Wayne was always telling me, 'Dennis, you need to play harder and stronger.' They had these (Vox) Superbeetle amps. When you're doing sock hops and parties, it was the PA system, the Vox columns and a couple of woofers,\" Thompson told the Free Press. \"The drums weren't miked, but the amps were cranked on 10. They were drowning me out. So I started hitting them harder and harder. I had to play as powerfully as I could to break through that wall of sound.\"\n\nThompson remained with the MC5 through its infamous rise and fall in the late '60s and early '70s, including the group's time as Grande Ballroom house band, the powerhouse live debut album \"Kick Out the Jams\" and a notorious performance amid demonstrations outside Chicago's Democratic National Convention in 1968.\n\nThompson was uneasy with the radical image the MC5 took on over time, and he would later say the Chicago DNC performance was \"my epiphany.\"\n\n\"We became a political band. The media tagged us as a band that was the vanguard of 'the revolution,'\" he said in 2003. \"I didn't want to be the band of the revolution. It's not what we started out to do. Looking back from a 30-year vantage point, I can see it was beneficial because of the notoriety. It was powerful stuff, and that media notoriety helped make us household word. But at same time it was ending our career. It was killing us.\"\n\nThompson went on to participate in a series of reunion projects with Kramer and Davis during the 2000s.\n\nThis story is developing.

The MC5 were one of the most aggressive and politically active bands of the 1960s and their driving brand of rock music was a foundation of punk rock, Motorhead and every strain of hard rock that followed.\n\nAccording to the Free Press, Thompson passed away at MediLodge of Taylor, where he had been rehabilitating following a heart attack in April.\n\nHis death follows the passing of the band's guitarist, Wayne Kramer, and influential manager, John Sinclair, in recent months. Just weeks ago the band was finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a long-overdue accolade that only Thompson had lived to see. His first reaction, Becky Tyner, widow of MC5 singer Rob Tyner, told the Free Press was: \"It's about fucking time!\" He told her he was eager to attend October's induction ceremony in Cleveland.\n\nRaised in Detroit, Thompson and Kramer played together as teenagers in a band called the Bounty Hunters. He joined Kramer, guitarist Fred Smith, singer Rob Tyner and bassist Michael Davis in the MC5 in 1965 and the group quickly became popular on the vibrant Detroit music scene. As rock evolved in the mid-1960s, the MC5 rapidly evolved with it, moving from its beat-group origins to something much more aggressive. The bandmembers' hair grew longer, their politics (deeply influenced by Sinclair) more radical, and their sound grew quickly into a vibrant form of hard rock spiked influenced by free-form jazz.\n\nThe group was incubated in Detroit's famous Grande Ballroom, where they opened for countless top acts of the era -- ranging from the Who and Cream to Sun Ra -- and their debut album, the classic \"Kick Out the Jams,\" was recorded live at the venue in 1968. True to form, the original cover artwork the group submitted for the album was a psychedelic painting featuring a giant marijuana leaf (its label, Elektra Records, used a collage of live band photos instead).\n\nThe group's politics, as much as its rebellious attitude, caused problems every step of the way. The MC5 was the only act to perform in Chicago during the infamous Democratic National Convention in 1968 where police attacked thousands of young demonstrators. The stance suited Sinclair and Kramer but did not sit well with Thompson.\n\n\"We became a political band. The media tagged us as a band that was the vanguard of 'the revolution,'\" he said in 2003, according to the Free Press. \"I didn't want to be the band of the revolution. It's not what we started out to do. Looking back from a 30-year vantage point, I can see it was beneficial because of the notoriety. It was powerful stuff, and that media notoriety helped make us a household word. But at same time it was ending our career. It was killing us.\"\n\nThe group also feuded with Elektra and were dropped. They released two strong albums for Atlantic -- 1970's \"Back in the USA,\" which was produced by future Bruce Springsteen producer/manager Jon Landau, and \"High Time\" the following year -- but drug addiction felled Thompson and other band members. He kicked his addiction, but the MC5 petered out in 1972.\n\nThompson continued to perform with Detroit-area bands over the years and worked with Kramer and Davis in the 2000s.", "source": {"uri":

He was 75.\n\nThompson was the last remaining member of powerhouse Detroit rock outfit MC5, who were announced as inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April. The deeply influential rock act, known for its counterculture politics and its rollicking anthem \"Kick Out the Jams,\" had been nominated for induction six times but had never made the cut.

His father worked two jobs and his dream was that his son graduate with an engineering degree from Wayne State University. Fate, it seems, had other plans.\n\n\"If my parents ever thought I would wind up on a high performance search and destroy team as the MC5, I think my drums might have magically disappeared one night,\" Thompson wrote in a 2018 post on his website.\n\nThompson also played drums in the MC5 revival act, DKT/MC5, from 2003 to 2012.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Thompson_(drummer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Thompson (drummer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC5", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MC5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_Out_the_Jams_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kick Out the Jams (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Detroit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music of Detroit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Kramer_(guitarist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Kramer (guitarist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sinclair_(poet)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Sinclair (poet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Related_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Related Merchandise", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/09/PDTN/73632051007-dennis-thompson-right-page-1-a-1-1-25-alanv-343-img-a-120-davisrefer-2021-2-1-j-9-ald-2-himg-a-120-davisrefer-2021-2-1-j-9-ald-2-h.jpg?auto=webp&crop=871,491,x2,y575&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554869", "eventUri": "eng-9554869", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-19", "textStart": 785, "textEnd": 792}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Thompson was known for laying down the grooves on the group's seminal rock live album, Kick Out the Jams.\n\nThompson was been recovering from complications due to a heart attack when he received the news that he would be entering the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last month. In response to the news, Thompson's reaction was that their inclusion was long overdue, telling original vocalist Rob Tyner's widow Becky \"It's about fucking time\", as she told to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nAs of yet, his family are yet to issue a statement regarding Thompson's death. The drummer was the final surviving member of the legendary band. No official cause of death has been revealed.\n\nOutside of working in the world of hard rock, MC5 were known as one of the most political bands of their time, having aligned themselves with the White Panther movement early in their career. Their manager John Sinclair, who had also passed on earlier this year, was known for being involved in the radical political party and even the subject of a John Lennon song about the movement.\n\nTheir political slant led to them making appearances at various rallies, including the 1968 Democratic National Convention, which saw a large number of student protests. While they would continue to work on various studio projects throughout the late 1960s, the group would eventually fall apart due to drug problems after working on the album, High Time.\n\nAfter the band completed two studio albums, they split up to work on various solo projects, only resurrecting the group's name over the years for various one-off shows. For every star-studded show, Thompson returned behind the kit to back founding guitarist Wayne Kramer, who helped take over vocal duties after Tyner's passing in 1991.\n\nSince Kramer's passing months ago, Thompson's death makes him the final MC5 member to depart the world. Though Kramer had mentioned that the latest version of the MC5 was working on new material shortly before his death, there is still no word on when any of those tracks will surface.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_coffman@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Tim Coffman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Thompson_(drummer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Thompson (drummer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC5", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MC5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_Out_the_Jams_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kick Out the Jams (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garage rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beat (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Panther_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Panther Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sinclair_(poet)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Sinclair (poet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hard rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1968 Democratic National Convention protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Kramer_(guitarist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Kramer (guitarist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Lennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitarist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitarist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2023/04/The-MC5-Band-Live-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554869", "eventUri": "eng-9554869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

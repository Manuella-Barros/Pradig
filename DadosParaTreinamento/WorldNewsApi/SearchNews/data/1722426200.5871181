{"id": 243306256, "title": "Marcell Ozuna drives in 3, Charlie Morton holds former team to 3 hits as Braves beat Pirates 6-1", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Marcell Ozuna drove in three runs with a bases-loaded double in Atlanta\u2019s five-run third inning, Charlie Morton gave up only three hits to Pittsburgh, his former home, and the Braves beat the Pirates 6-1 on Friday night. Morton, 40, has wins against every major league team with his first win over the Pirates. He pitched for Pittsburgh from 2009 through 2015. The 40-year-old right-hander pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings and had seven strikeouts. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a special place for me for Pittsburgh,\u201d Morton said. \u201cI spent seven seasons there and experienced a lot of lows and highs.\u201d Austin Riley hit his ninth homer, including six in the last 14 games. The Braves scored six runs in four innings off Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (1-4) in the left-hander\u2019s return from the injured list. P\u00e9rez had been out since May 27 with a left groin muscle strain. The highlight for the Pirates came in the eighth when Bryan Reynolds singled up the middle off Jesse Chavez, extending his hitting streak to 24 games, the longest in the majors this season. It is the longest streak by a Pittsburgh hitter since 2003. Morton (5-4) was dominant in only his second career start against Pittsburgh. \u201cThat was old-school Charlie Morton curve ball,\u201d said Pirates manager Derek Shelton. \u201cHe had the ability to go to it anytime he wanted to. You see why he\u2019s pitched 15 years in the big leagues. I don\u2019t know if he can have a better curve ball than that.\u201d Braves manager Brian Snitker said Morton completing his list of wins against every team \u201cis a pretty cool thing.\u201d \u201cWhat he does is amazing to me with all the innings and years and pitches,\u201d Snitker said. Morton hit Reynolds with a pitch in the first and walked Nick Gonzales in the second. He retired 10 consecutive hitters before Ke\u2019Bryan Hayes\u2019 single up the middle with one out in the fifth for the Pirates\u2019 first hit. Andrew McCutchen opened the sixth with an infield single and Gonzales doubled to open the seventh. The Pirates avoided a shutout when Hayes\u2019 two-out double off Aaron Bummer in the ninth drove in Connor Joe, who had a pinch-hit double. TRAINER\u2019S ROOM Pirates: Rookie RHP Jared Jones had his normal turn in the rotation skipped. Jones has logged 86 innings after throwing a career-high 126 1/3 in the minor leagues last season. \u201cWe went into the season knowing from the get-go we were going to have to be mindful of his innings,\u201d Shelton said. ... IF Jake Lamb signed as a minor league free agent and was assigned to Triple-A Indianapolis. Braves: OF Ram\u00f3n Laureano did not start for the second straight game due to lower back soreness after making a throw in the second game of Wednesday\u2019s double-header at St. Louis. ... LHP A.J. Minter (left hip inflammation) is scheduled to throw Sunday at Triple-A Gwinnett in possibly his final rehab appearance since landing on the IL on May 30. UP NEXT Pittsburgh rookie standout RHP Paul Skenes (4-0, 2.14 ERA) will face Braves LHP Max Fried (7-3, 3.00) on Saturday. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty special,\u201d said Snitker of Skenes, who has allowed no more than one earned run in five of his eight starts. \u201cAs hard as it will be, it\u2019s kind of cool when you see a young talent like that in person.\u201d ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3BpcmF0ZXMtYnJhdmVzLXNjb3JlLW1vcnRvbi1lOTMzMzkzNDMwMjM3YjRlNTFlYjVhZTY1NjE4MTc1OdIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Marcell Ozuna drives in 3, Charlie Morton holds former team to 3 hits as Braves beat Pirates 6-1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/pirates-braves-score-morton-e933393430237b4e51eb5ae656181759", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/608c150/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2626x1477+0+139/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fdc%2Fce%2F0a4b6c052665e3542f7b65b153ca%2Fb536a255769246d58b8f1c167059f2ed", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:22:24", "author": "Charles Odum", "authors": ["Charles Odum"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.038}

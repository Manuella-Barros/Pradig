{"id": 223813332, "title": "I craved quiet. Then my sons moved out, dog died and hens were killed \u2013 and noise now feels necessary", "text": "It\u2019s all so quiet. Just the way I like it: my husband is out; it\u2019s pouring, so no one is mowing (the only thing that ever breaches the peace around here) and even the birds are taking a rain check. I can hear my own breathing; hear myself think. But what I\u2019m thinking is: is it too quiet? I craved quiet for so long. For 30 years, actually, since my first year at university. I was living with three others who did an entirely normal amount of partying, dancing and shagging. But I was quietly falling apart and hearing all that ordinary, raucous life made me feel desperately sad and out of control. Since then, I\u2019ve passed through shared accommodation where I was the weird 21-year-old knocking on doors in my pyjamas to ask neighbours to turn their music down; city blocks where you knew exactly what everyone was watching on TV; a street frequented by 5am glass-recycling lorries; and, for a particularly challenging time, a house next to a family of brass instrumentalists. It all spawned an obsession with avoiding noise that eventually brought us to this quiet cocoon in this peaceful suburb. It\u2019s a privilege I\u2019m intensely grateful for, and privilege is the word: the pernicious effects of noise pollution \u2013 estimated to cause 12,000 premature deaths a year in the EU alone \u2013 disproportionately affects low-income areas; you really can buy silence. But recently, the volume on my life has been turned down still further. For a start, my sons moved out, radically paring back the domestic soundscape. No more background burble of Netflix and podcasts, slammed doors or clattering, sizzling cooking experiments; our chats are scheduled now. I quit my (remote) day job, removing a baseline of regular conversation with other humans from my week. In the autumn we lost the dog and with him, a deeply familiar, deeply missed playlist: nails clicking on tiles, the urgent yelp to go outside, a sigh as if deflating as he settled on his bed, and soft, slack-lipped snores as he slept in my office. Then \u2013 and this made me sadder than it should in this world \u2013 when I was away in February, foxes took five of my six hens. I loved those little girls with all my heart, and I loved the aural landscape they created in the garden: conversational clucks; excitable snack rivalry; contented purrs (truly!); the triumphant announcement of an egg. You can\u2019t keep a hen solo, so a kind friend welcomed the survivor into her own flock. I\u2019ll get more, eventually, but my heart is too bruised, and the foxes too hungry. So here I am, leading my quietest possible life. I\u2019m not sure what I thought would happen when I attained peak peace \u2013 I\u2019d start running or write the Great Yorkshire Novel (equally quixotic ambitions)? But I haven\u2019t become Proust in his cork-lined room; I\u2019m aimless, a bit odd and, guess what: perversely drawn to noise. I\u2019m addicted to the Merlin birdsong app, parsing every chirrup and trill of avian drama in our postcode, often catching myself explaining something a goldfinch did to my patient husband like a Minecraft-obsessed child (I should probably stop doing that; if I bore him away, I\u2019ll be in real trouble). I talk to plants and domestic appliances, waylay the postman and clumsily compliment strangers in the street on their gardens, dogs or coats. Like Marnie, the solitary heroine of David Nicholls\u2019 new novel You Are Here (I have ample quiet reading time now), I make little sounds that aren\u2019t quite language as I potter round. I\u2019ve even started to enjoy, not resent, involuntarily eavesdropping on the virtual meeting noise emanating from my husband\u2019s office, even popping in to offer unsolicited, ill-informed opinions on procurement matters. I\u2019ll be inviting Tory canvassers in to chat next. I craved (most of) this quietness and I got it; lucky me. I could never go back to knowing the council noise abatement team number by heart. But the past few months have reminded me not to insulate myself entirely; not to switch on max noise cancelling on life. Because \u2013 whisper it \u2013 I think there might actually be such a thing as too quiet.", "summary": "<p>For thirty years I longed to turn down the volume on my life.

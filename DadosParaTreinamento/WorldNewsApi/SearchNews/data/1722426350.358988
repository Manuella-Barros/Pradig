That\u2019s a question Justice Nigel Pilgrim will consider over the next two weeks as he contemplates Ranguy\u2019s sentence. Ranguy appeared in the Belize High Court today for sentencing where his attorney, Senior Council Godfrey Smith submitted that he should receive a fixed term sentence rather than life in prison. Smith\u2019s argument was on the grounds of the possibility of diminished responsibility. He explained that at the time Ranguy brutally murdered his mother, Karen Skeen; his stepfather, Robert Vellos, and his sister, Teena Skeen back in 2012, he may have been sleepwalking. Godfrey Smith, Attorney at Law: \u201cHe already pled guilty. That has certain implications. At this stage of the proceedings, which is sentencing, you are entitled to put forward every circumstance to the judge that you believe is relevant to the justness of the sentence. We are saying that recognized international experts have raised it as a possibility. Their words were it cannot be ruled out. That combined with the fact that we weren\u2019t able to corroborate that because of the absence of medical records so long afterwards is no fault of his. The state from the moment he raised sleepwalking, which was the very next day, we say, the state had an obligation to examine this. He had no forensic psychiatric report until we intervened. We\u2019re not saying he\u2019s not guilty. We\u2019re saying when you look at all of that it may not be the just thing to imprison him for life. And that is what we urged upon the court.\u201d Smith recommended that the court set Ranguy\u2019s sentence at a fixed term of 37 years and deduct the 12 years he spent on remand at the Belize Central Prison, leaving him with 25 years to go. The prosecution rebutted Smith\u2019s submission, saying that, given the severity of the crime, life in prison was the only suitable sentence. Crown Council Riis Cattouse said that Ranguy should not be given any discount on his sentence, as the aggravating factors outweighed anything presented in mitigation. Outside the courtroom, Ranguy\u2019s family was disappointed that he would not be sentenced today but said they would keep returning to court until the matter is concluded. Family member Rene Skeen says he does not believe sleepwalking should be considered as a factor in sentencing and he has lost respect for Godfrey Smith for even presenting that possibility. Skeen did say, however, that Ranguy\u2019s guilty plea leads him to believe that forgiveness may be possible at some point. Rene Skeen, Relative of Deceased: \u201cWe\u2019ve been here as a family more than 25 times over the last almost 12 years. So the importance of being here today, honestly, we thought he would have been sentenced today. That\u2019s what we were hoping but then again, the court system have to take its course. I don\u2019t want to be rude, but I will be blunt. The little bit of respect I had for Godfrey Smith I lose it. You know why ? I will tell you why? Because a few months ago Jared pleaded guilty and he tried the case all over again talking about sleepwalking. You interviewed me, you guys interviewed me many, many times and this is always my defense about sleepwalking. The noise that one makes, I don\u2019t care how much you sleepwalk or how deep you\u2019re asleep you will wake up. Now you\u2019re talking about what maybe seven, eight, nine shots ? You\u2019re talking about taking a knife and stabbing your mom more than a dozen times and you\u2019re sleepwalking ? I rest my case right there about Godfrey Smith. If we would have had to go to a trial we would have had to see, like I said, weapons, guns, bloody clothes, pictures, everything that would just bring back the sad memories again. So by him pleaded guilty, hence the reason I used to say I could never forgive him, but when he pleaded guilty, I said you know what, maybe one day I will. One day I probably will forgive him.\u201d After changing attorneys multiple times over the past 12 years, Ranguy pleaded guilty to three counts of murder on March 15. The matter has seen three judges preside over the case since 2012.", "summary": "Was sleepwalking a factor in the case of Jared Ranguy murdering three members of his family?

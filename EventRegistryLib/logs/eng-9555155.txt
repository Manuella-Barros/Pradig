Early access to shows, live event tickets, and access to a special Discord server are included in a Beacon membership, priced at $6 monthly or $60 annually. Fans can enjoy same-day access to Critical Role VODs, new shows like Critical Role Abridged, and 10% discount at online stores, while still being able to watch on Twitch and YouTube.\n\nCritical Role just announced Beacon, its new membership and streaming service that includes exclusive bonus content, early access to shows, and other premium perks. Run by Critical Role directly, this new service does not replace existing options like Twitch or YouTube, but is a different platform through which fans can support the company and its Dungeons and Dragons actual play shows.\n\nAfter getting its start through Geek & Sundry in 2015, Critical Role Productions fully split off from parent company Legendary Digital Networks in 2019 and became an independent multimedia group. Since then, it has launched other Critical Role trade names, including Darrington Press, Metapigeon, and the Critical Role Foundation.\n\nRelated Dungeons & Dragons: 6 Best Spell Uses in Critical Role D&D fans can only marvel at the way these following spells were brilliantly used in the famous actual-play show, Critical Role.\n\nNow, Critical Role has officially revealed its own independent streaming service. Named after the Luxon Beacons from the campaign, Beacon is a new one-stop shop for all things Critical Role. Subscribers gain access to all content on the site, including same day access to Critical Role VODs and podcasts, early access to live show tickets and new shows like Critical Role Abridged, Re-Slayers Take, and Midst, and exclusive access to Critical Role Cooldown and Fireside Chats, two new talk-back shows. Members also get a 10% discount at all Critical Role online shops, as well as access to a special Discord server.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nWhat Is Critical Role's Beacon Streaming Service?\n\nA new Critical Role membership service that costs $6 monthly or $60 annually. A 7-day free trial is available, including all the non-sale membership perks.\n\nSame-Day Access All existing episodes of Critical Role, Candela Obscura, and other shows Critical Role VOD and podcast access\n\nEarly Access Critical Role Abridged, new edited episodes that cut out filler to make each one between 60 and 90 minutes Re-Slayers Take, a spinoff podcast series airing on May 20 Midst Live event tickets\n\nExclusive Access Members-only Discord server Critical Role Cooldown, a new aftershow that picks up immediately when each episode ends Fireside Chats, a new monthly AMA featuring questions taken from Discord 10% discount on all Critical Role online stores\n\nAccording to the Critical Role cast, Beacon is the most direct way fans can support the show. Likened to a Patreon without Patreon, Beacon cuts out other corporations from the equation in a way reminiscent of Dimension 20's Dropout. That said, while Beacon seems like the new go-to for supporting Critical Role, fans will still be able to watch their shows on YouTube and Twitch, and subscribe on either service.\n\nClose\n\nWere that not exciting enough, Critical Role also announced a Bells Hells live show in Los Angeles on June 15. Featuring a 45-minute Q&A pre-show moderated by Dropout's Brennan Lee Mulligan, subscribers to Beacon will get early access to ticket sales for this show, but everyone can enjoy watching the livestream on June 20.\n\nCritical Role Release Date March 12, 2015 Seasons 3 (Campaigns) Based On Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition Number of Episodes 200+ Streaming Service(s) YouTube", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_law@gamerant.com", "name": "Eric Law", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Critical Role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Early access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&_Dragons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dungeons & Dragons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role_Productions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Critical Role Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Actual play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrington_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darrington Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legendary Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_&_Schuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simon & Schuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropout_(streaming_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dropout (streaming platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennan_Lee_Mulligan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brennan Lee Mulligan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aftershow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_&_Dragons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Editions of Dungeons & Dragons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal_Design", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal Design", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Reviews", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/critical-role-beacon-streaing-service.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555155", "eventUri": "eng-9555155", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 2735, "textEnd": 2741}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 3547, "textEnd": 3554}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 3761, "textEnd": 3768}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-03-12", "textStart": 3798, "textEnd": 3812}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 237, "relevance": 1}

On Thursday, the group of Dungeons & Dragons-playing voice actors announced Beacon, a new membership program that promises to be \"the most direct way\" to support Critical Role. Beacon will offer \"a wide range of exclusive and early access programming\" among its member perks and, crucially, let Critical Role bypass third-party video services like YouTube and Twitch, where much of its content is streamed and hosted.\n\nBut Critical Role isn't abandoning those platforms, its creators say. \"Nothing changes for audiences on Twitch and YouTube,\" Critical Role CEO and cast member Travis Willingham said in a video announcing Beacon. But the new members-only Beacon promises \"a more unfiltered experience\" for fans of Critical Role, Willingham said.\n\nBeacon will cost $5.99 monthly, or $59.99 annually. Critical Role is currently offering a free, limited, seven-day trial.\n\nIn addition to early access programming and exclusive videos, Beacon promises live event pre-sales (which would hopefully help members avoid sold-out shows, scalpers, and surge pricing), instant access to videos on demand and podcasts, access to an exclusive Discord server, and discounts on merchandise.\n\nBeacon will boast two exclusive series: Critical Role Fireside Chat, described as a monthly Ask Me Anything series where cast members answer questions from Discord; and Critical Role Cooldown, a \"backstage pass\" that promises to let viewers experience the cast's post-show reactions. Beacon subscribers will also get early access to series Critical Role Abridged, a condensed highlight reel-style show, alongside all-ages actual play audio series Re-Slayer's Take and day-and-date audio versions of the mainline Critical Role broadcasts.\n\nMarisha Ray, cast member and creative director at Critical Role, said Beacon lets the troupe \"bring more of our business in-house.\" Less reliance on third-party platform providers seems to be a big part of Critical Role's plan. \"It's no secret that video platforms have [...] been through their ups and downs,\" Ray said, adding, \"it's not uncommon for our content to get demonetized because we all have the vocabulary of teenage sailors.\" Ray also acknowledged platforms like YouTube and Twitch running ads on Critical Role content \"that don't really vibe with our beliefs.\"\n\nWillingham mentioned another third-party platform: Patreon. He said Beacon will offer fans \"a more direct line\" to Critical Role's content, cast, and community.\n\n\"We're incredibly excited about what Beacon opens up for us, and how we engage with our audience,\" Willingham said in a statement. \"Nothing changes with how folks can watch our current slate of shows and we're stoked to offer access, content and perks in ways that we never have before.\"\n\nCritical Role launched nine years ago as a web series where professional voice actors (Laura Bailey, Taliesin Jaffe, Ashley Johnson, Matthew Mercer, Liam O'Brien, Marisha Ray, Sam Riegel, and Travis Willingham) improvise their way through D&D campaigns. Over the course of hundreds of episodes spanning multiple campaigns, Critical Role has evolved and expanded to include comic books, animated series, their own tabletop role-playing game systems, and other video spinoff series. The series' creators say that Beacon will let them continue to invest in their franchises and business.", "source": {"uri": "polygon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Polygon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_mcwhertor@polygon.com", "name": "Michael McWhertor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Critical Role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Early access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Actual play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Willingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Willingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_&_Schuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simon & Schuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radio drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisha_Ray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marisha Ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Johnson_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Johnson (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliesin_Jaffe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taliesin Jaffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Riegel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Riegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Mercer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Mercer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patreon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&_Dragons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dungeons & Dragons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tabletop role-playing game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animated series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HULPGJaIbtF6Ini9SnnB1HHVbD8=/0x69:2040x1089/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23278092/Untitled__1_.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555155", "eventUri": "eng-9555155", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 236, "relevance": 1}

Memberships will cost $5.99/month (or $59.99 annually) and will also come with early exclusive access to several new series and features. Critical Role will continue to stream its main series content on YouTube and Twitch. Shortly after launch, the Beacon.tv site was experiencing heavy traffic and periodically crashing, although it's main page was available as of press time.\n\nAs part of the announcement, Critical Role launched several new shows that will either air exclusively on Beacon or will have \"early access\" on Beacon. The exclusive series includes a monthly Critical Role Fireside Chat (held live on Beacon), and Critical Role Cooldown, which features post-show reactions from the cast. Debuting on Beacon on Early Access includes a new Critical Role Abridged series, which condenses the third Critical Role campaign episodes into 60-90 minute episodes, and the new podcast Re-Slayer's Take, which focuses a group of adventurers rejected from the monster hunting group The Slayer's Take. That show features George Primavera and Nick Williams as the game masters and cast members Jasmine Bhullar, Jasper William Cartwright, Caroline Lux, and Jasmine Chiong. Re-Slayer's Take debuts on May 20th as a podcast everywhere but is available on Beacon two weeks early. Beacon subscribers will also have access to Critical Role podcasts on the same day that the show is broadcast on video platforms, which is a week ahead of other podcast platforms.\n\nCritical Role will also give Beacom members early access to event tickets, with a new live show announced for June. The new Bells Hells Live Show will take place on June 15th in Los Angeles and will feature Travis Willingham, Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Sam Riegel, Taliesin Jaffe, Ashley Johnson, Marisha Ray and Robbie Daymond run a normal episode of Critical Role. Tickets will go on sale for Beacon members on May 20th and will be available for everyone else on May 21st.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Critical Role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Bailey_(model)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Bailey (model)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisha_Ray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marisha Ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Johnson_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Johnson (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliesin_Jaffe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taliesin Jaffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Riegel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Riegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Daymond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbie Daymond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Willingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Willingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gamemaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/05/09/cf4751db-bd62-4af5-aa4a-2ad43d6f89db/beacon-header.png?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555155", "eventUri": "eng-9555155", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1595, "textEnd": 1603, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 2018, "textEnd": 2027}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 2319, "textEnd": 2327}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 233, "relevance": 1}

Log in.\n\nThey've been streaming on the platform for more than nine years now and have a 1.3-million-strong fanbase on the site.\n\nNow, Critical Role is striking out on its own with the launch of Beacon, an in-house membership service.\n\nBeacon essentially gives people what they get with a Twitch subscription -- instant access to VODs of their livestreams, but with some additional perks.\n\nThe $5.99-a-month Beacon membership comes with exclusive access to additional Critical Role programs. Also on offer is the inside track to a private Discord server, discounts on the team's merch store, and early pre-sale dibs on tickets to their live events.\n\nViewers of the show on Twitch and YouTube can still watch the show for free, according to its regular release schedule.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much of its subscriber base Critical Role will be able to draw away from Twitch, which does give Amazon Prime users a free subscription to one channel.\n\nCritical Role also made bank on Twitch, where it still has a massive viewer base. Going it alone is, by all estimates, a daring gambit.\n\nThat said, it would be unwise to bet against a crew that ran an $11.3 million fundraising run that smashed Kickstarter records, launched games that should make Hasbro nervous and sold out an arena in London.\n\nMarisha Ray, Critical Role cast member and the company's creative director, was candid in a YouTube video announcing the service's launch about why the crew was making this move.\n\nSpeaking to fans, she called it \"the most direct way that you can support us and everything we do\" while not having \"a portion of your hard-earned subscription dollars going to a massive third-party corporation.\"\n\n\"Over the years, it has become a huge priority for us to bring more and more of our business in-house. And it's no secret that video platforms have -- let's just say they've been through their ups and downs,\" Ray said.\n\n\"It's not uncommon for our content to get demonetized because we all have the vocabulary of teenage sailors,\" she added. \"Or on the extreme other end of the spectrum, we'll sometimes have ads run in front of our content that don't really vibe with our beliefs. That's not cool.\"\n\nCritical Role CEO Travis Willingham added that with \"every windfall,\" the team continues to \"purposefully reinvest\" in their company to make more content.\n\n\"The TL;DR is we kind of want to provide the best experience to you, our community,\" said Matthew Mercer, Critical Role's longtime game master and the company's chief creative officer. \"It was through your support that we were even allowed to go independent in the first place.\"\n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough Critical Role news for one day -- fans can also join what's expected to be a mad scrum for tickets to their upcoming live show. Pre-sales for Beacon members go live on May 20, with general sales a day later, on May 21.\n\nRepresentatives for Twitch did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cheryl_teh@businessinsider.com", "name": "Cheryl Teh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Critical Role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisha_Ray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marisha Ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kickstarter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hasbro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Mercer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Mercer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Willingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Willingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gamemaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_creative_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief creative officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/663d0ccc9686a6f37bfde341?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555155", "eventUri": "eng-9555155", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 2949, "textEnd": 2955}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 2992, "textEnd": 2998}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNew Missoula restaurant, Elote, set to host grand opening block party Business Buzz: New steakhouse, new food trucks, research trial at St. Pat's Man dies during 'physical altercation' with Missoula police One person killed in crash on Highway 93 MCPS school board approves 47 non-tenure position cuts Property taxes soar in Browning, perplexing residents 0 Bedroom Home in Missoula - $1,000,000 Small crime, big time: Missoula justice system grapples with homeless burglary charges 'Odd year' of snow makes slow Going-to-the-Sun Road clearing Search effort for missing Poplar man turned to 'recovery mission' Daines blocks confirmation of first Native American federal judge for Montana Civil suit filed against Missoula doctor Browning residents to receive refund for error that increased property taxes Residents of large Kalispell-area mobile home park face eviction Marshall Mountain officially under public ownership\n\nA funicular runs up the mountain to the town's salt mine, one of many throughout the region that offers tours. At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party. Local men - many with finely carved pipes and handlebar mustaches - strutted around in lederhosen and their finest Tyrolean-type hats, each with a proud feather sprouting from the rim.\n\nFor centuries, the town had no road access, so people came and went by boat. You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables. Places like Hallstatt.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

(Cameron Hewitt, Rick Steves' Europe)\n\nRick Steves\n\nIt's rare that a town's charm will get me out of bed early. The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading...

At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party. Local men - many with finely carved pipes and handlebar mustaches - strutted around in lederhosen and their finest Tyrolean-type hats, each with a proud feather sprouting from the rim.\n\nFor centuries, the town had no road access, so people came and went by boat. You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables. Places like Hallstatt.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

(Cameron Hewitt, Rick Steves' Europe)\n\nRick Steves\n\nIt's rare that a town's charm will get me out of bed early. The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading...

At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party. Local men - many with finely carved pipes and handlebar mustaches - strutted around in lederhosen and their finest Tyrolean-type hats, each with a proud feather sprouting from the rim.\n\nFor centuries, the town had no road access, so people came and went by boat. You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables.

(Cameron Hewitt, Rick Steves' Europe)\n\nRick Steves\n\nIt's rare that a town's charm will get me out of bed early. The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading...

At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party. Local men - many with finely carved pipes and handlebar mustaches - strutted around in lederhosen and their finest Tyrolean-type hats, each with a proud feather sprouting from the rim.\n\nFor centuries, the town had no road access, so people came and went by boat. You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables.

(Cameron Hewitt, Rick Steves' Europe)\n\nRick Steves\n\nIt's rare that a town's charm will get me out of bed early. The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading...

At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party. Local men - many with finely carved pipes and handlebar mustaches - strutted around in lederhosen and their finest Tyrolean-type hats, each with a proud feather sprouting from the rim.\n\nFor centuries, the town had no road access, so people came and went by boat. You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables.

(Cameron Hewitt, Rick Steves' Europe)\n\nRick Steves\n\nIt's rare that a town's charm will get me out of bed early. The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading...

At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party. Local men - many with finely carved pipes and handlebar mustaches - strutted around in lederhosen and their finest Tyrolean-type hats, each with a proud feather sprouting from the rim.\n\nFor centuries, the town had no road access, so people came and went by boat. You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables.

(Cameron Hewitt, Rick Steves' Europe)\n\nRick Steves\n\nIt's rare that a town's charm will get me out of bed early. The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading...

At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party. Local men - many with finely carved pipes and handlebar mustaches - strutted around in lederhosen and their finest Tyrolean-type hats, each with a proud feather sprouting from the rim.\n\nFor centuries, the town had no road access, so people came and went by boat. You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables. Places like Hallstatt.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

(Cameron Hewitt, Rick Steves' Europe)\n\nRick Steves\n\nIt's rare that a town's charm will get me out of bed early. The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading...

At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party.

You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables.

(Cameron Hewitt, Rick Steves' Europe)\n\nRick Steves\n\nIt's rare that a town's charm will get me out of bed early. The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\n'The Real Housewives of Napa Valley' debuts Friday Death of cyclists in Napa leads to criminal and civil lawsuits, documentary Napa city Planning Commissioner Bob Massaro dies Car rolls over on Highway 29 in Napa 'We feel identified': Thousands flock to Napa for La Onda's Latin music showcase Napa's Oxbow RiverStage concert series goes on hiatus as promoters seek new site Your guide to Festival La Onda: What to watch for, and how to get around downtown Napa BottleRock organizers tap into the Latino market with Festival La Onda Letter: Concerned for the future of the wine industry NFL: Former Vintage High lineman and Super Bowl champion Allen dies at age 52 Napa doctor launches concierge medical practice and fights obesity epidemic Festival La Onda takes a bow Sunday, concludes Napa debut Latin music, Latino fans gained the Napa spotlight at La Onda Napa Police seeks information about motorcyclist reported missing Napa grand jury criticizes county building permits, golf tournament's treatment\n\nA funicular runs up the mountain to the town's salt mine, one of many throughout the region that offers tours. At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party. Local men - many with finely carved pipes and handlebar mustaches - strutted around in lederhosen and their finest Tyrolean-type hats, each with a proud feather sprouting from the rim.\n\nFor centuries, the town had no road access, so people came and went by boat. You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables.

(Cameron Hewitt, Rick Steves' Europe)\n\nRick Steves\n\nIt's rare that a town's charm will get me out of bed early. The postcard-pretty, lake-cuddling town of Hallstatt, two hours south of Salzburg, is one of those places. First thing in the morning, I head to the high end of town to look at the glassy waters of Lake Hallstatt. With the town's church spire mirrored in the tranquil water, a shuttle boat cuts through its reflection, like a knife putting a swirl in the icing on a big cake. For just a moment, it disturbs this oasis of peace.\n\nHallstatt is located in Austria's Salzkammergut lake district, a scenic wonder that has enthralled nature lovers for centuries. This is Sound of Music country - idyllic and majestic, but not rugged, a gentle land where lakes and mountains are shuffled together like a game of 52-card pickup.\n\nBefore there was Rome, there was Hallstatt. One of Europe's oldest settlements, Hallstatt originated as a salt mining center (its name means \"place of salt\"). If you were to dig under some of its buildings, you'd find Roman and pre-Roman Celtic pavement stones from the ancient and prehistoric salt depot. Archaeologists claim that people have been coming here for salt since 7,000 BC (over the millennia, salt has been precious because it preserved meat).\n\nPeople are also reading... 2024 GENE \"PAPPY\" THOMPSON WINNER: Enduring legacy crafted by Eastside's ultra-talented Taylor Clay REGION 2D BASEBALL: Wise Central upsets John Battle, Lebanon rolls past Gate City in semifinals City questions group's decision for July 4 celebration REGION 1D BASEBALL: Chilhowie rides \"Big Game Tuell\" to another regional title with win over Rural Retreat REGION 3D BASEBALL: Lord Botetourt uses first-inning blitz, Abingdon miscues to stun top-seeded Falcons in semis VHSL CLASS 2 TRACK & FIELD: Lee High girls win state title behind Hammonds; Virginia High's Skinner wins twice REGION 2D SOFTBALL: John Battle, Wise County Central secure state bids, will play Thursday for regional title VHSL CLASS 1 & 2 STATE TRACK & FIELD: Tazewell's Landri Lallande, Rural Retreat's Olivia Crigger win state titles on Day 1 VHSL PLAYOFFS: Three Wise Central teams advance to state tournaments REGION 1D SOFTBALL: Eastside wins fourth regional title by gutting out 6-5 win over rival Rye Cove VHSL STATE QUARTERFINAL PRIMER: Baseball teams at Rural Retreat, Wise Central join usual suspects in state tourney PREP TRACK & FIELD: Return to big stage for Patrick Henry's Grant Buchanan among storylines to watch for local athletes in VHSL state meets Probe continues into Friday coal mine fatality 2024 GENE \"PAPPY\" THOMPSON AWARD FINALIST NO. 5: Anthony Torbett, Sullivan East REGION 2D BASEBALL: Lebanon whips Wise County Central in finals, puts another trophy in the case\n\nA funicular runs up the mountain to the town's salt mine, one of many throughout the region that offers tours. At the mine, visitors slip into overalls, meet their guide, and hike deep into the mountain to learn about the history of salt. A highlight of the visit is riding down long banisters, miner-style, from one floor to the next ... praying for no splinters.\n\nWhen I first discovered Hallstatt, this was a remote community at the far end of a long, dead-end lake. Though tourism has trampled some of its charm, vivid cultural traditions still survive. Traditional green felt hats distinguished by jaunty decorative feathers are big in Austria. On my first trip here, when I was just a teenybopper, my dad and I each bought a hat and had a friendly competition filling it with souvenir pins and fancy feathers. Forty years later, I happened to be in town during the annual feather-in-the-hat party. Local men - many with finely carved pipes and handlebar mustaches - strutted around in lederhosen and their finest Tyrolean-type hats, each with a proud feather sprouting from the rim.\n\nFor centuries, the town had no road access, so people came and went by boat. You'll still see the traditional wide, flat Fuhr boats, designed to carry heavy loads of salt in shallow water. On a recent visit, a local friend took me for a spin in his Fuhr. As he lunged rhythmically on the single oar, he said, \"An hour on the lake is like a day of vacation.\" When I asked about the oar lock, which looked like a skinny dog-chew doughnut, he told me it was \"made from the gut of a bull. Not of cow, but a bull.\"\n\nFacing the lake is Pension Hallberg, with a display of debris from the bottom of Lake Hallstatt. The most fascinating treasure is a trove of Nazi paraphernalia, including piles of war medallions. As I tried to sort this out, their explanation made perfect sense: When it became clear that Germany would lose World War II, those who served the Third Reich wanted to chuck any medals they had won. Lakes were the perfect trash bin.\n\nIn this town, when someone is happy to see you, they'll often say, \"Can I cook you a fish?\" I still remember the morning fish-selling ritual: A teenage boy rhythmically grabbed trout from the fishermen's pen and killed them one by one with a stern whack to the noggin. Another guy carried them to the tiny fishery, where they were gutted by a guy who used to do the stern whacking. A cat waited outside the door, confident his breakfast would be a good one. Restaurateurs and homemakers alike lined up, waiting to buy fresh trout to feed hungry tourists or special friends.\n\nRestaurant Br\u00e4ugasthof, lakeside and under a grand chestnut tree, is just the place to try some of Lake Hallstatt's prized fish. Reinanke (whitefish) is caught wild out of Lake Hallstatt and served the same day. Saibling (lake trout) is cheaper and also tasty. While you dine, you can feed the swans, who patrol the lake like it's theirs, and stretch greedily for every bit of bread you toss.\n\nWhen I think of my favorite small-town places in Europe, they are where nature and culture mix, where each balcony has a lovingly watered, one-of-a-kind flowerbox, and where swans know just the right time to paddle by for scraps from diners at lakeside tables. Places like Hallstatt.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

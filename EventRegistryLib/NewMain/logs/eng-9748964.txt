From what I'm seeing, the way he's acting now and what his physicians report saw, it seems to have been a superficial wound to the ear and that's all,\" Fauci said in comments, highlighted by Mediaite.\n\nYes, it's dangerous to make diagnoses from a distance, but really, this is kind of an obvious observation, and it's unclear why this was brought up in this conversation - other than that this is a pretty gobsmackingly major event, and one would suppose that Blitzer, having a man who is supposedly some sort of medical authority on his show, might want to ask his opinion.\n\nBut Dr. Fauci's medical credibility ain't what it might be.\n\nSee Related:\n\nMore COVID Lockdown Casualties - Youngest Children 'Academically and Developmentally' Behind\n\nWhy Is Dr. Fauci Worried About What RFK Jr. Says About Him and COVID Vaccines If It's Not True?\n\nAn injury like that suffered by former President Trump shouldn't have any lasting effect. Assuming that the AR-pattern rifle used by Thomas Crooks was a 5.56mm piece, which most of them are, and assuming that the shot fired one of the most common rounds for that cartridge - a 55-grain full metal jacket (FMJ) bullet or a 62-grain FMJ - while this is a high-velocity round, the bullet encountering a structure as thin and non-resistant as an ear would almost certainly just punch a hole, rather like a hole punch in a ream of paper.\n\nEars are, of course, very vascular, and any injury to the ear will bleed a lot. Anyone who has ever nicked an earlobe shaving will attest to this. Therefore, the amount of blood on Trump's head and face at the moment of the event.\n\nDr. Fauci's speculation on the nature of the former President's injury may be correct, but it's also obvious to anyone with even rudimentary medical expertise.

Trump was nearly assassinated.\n\nThe former president came perilously close to becoming the first major party candidate to be killed with a shot to the head since Bobby Kennedy back in 1968 but miraculously, the shooter's bullet only nicked his ear, giving rise to kooky left-wing conspiracy theories about his injury.\n\nOn Friday, the elfin former career bureaucrat seemed to mainstream the claims of the tinfoil hatters during an appearance on CNN where he downplayed Trump's headshot as a \"superficial wound to the ear, and that's all.\"\n\n(Video: CNN)\n\n\"What more does the public need to know about the extent of Donald Trump's injuries and his treatment?\" Blitzer asked.\n\n\"You know, I don't think there is much more to it. I mean, from what we've seen and what we've heard, it was, it was a bullet shot that grazed his ear and injured his ear, according to the physicians who examined him. There was no other further damage,\" Fauci told the CNN propagandist.\n\n\"So I think that with regard to the health related purely to the bullet itself, I think he's in the clear as far as I can see,\" he continued. \"I mean, it's dangerous to make diagnoses from a distance from what I'm seeing, the way he's acting now and what his physician's report saw. It seems to have been a superficial wound to the ear, and that's all.\"\n\n\"I just want to just read one line, from chief medical correspondent Doctor Sanjay Gupta who said this, and I'll read it to you. This is Doctor Sanjay Gupta saying gunshot blast near the head can cause injuries that aren't immediately noticeable, such as bleeding in or on the brain, damage to the inner ear, or even psychological trauma, as you know. He's a neurosurgeon. What do you make of that?\" Blitzer said, previewing the next line of attacks to discredit Trump.\n\n\"Well, I mean, I know Sanjay's a good friend, he's got a good clinical judgment. He's a practicing neurosurgeon. So, again, it's very difficult from a distance when you're not examining someone yourself to make any projection about it,\" Fauci replied.\n\n\"I'm just commenting on what I'm seeing superficially, I would imagine, Wolf, that his physicians did some studying. They very likely did an imaging study being a CT or an MRI or what have you. I don't know that as a fact, but I would think that that would be a reasonable thing to do following an encounter the way he had with a bullet,\" he added.\n\nX users have had enough of the diminutive liar who continues to be featured in the media long after the horrors that he visited upon America have subsided.\n\nTo many, Fauci's appearance was typically sleazy and dishonest as the regime's media sock puppets seek to regain control of the narrative with their implications that something isn't right with Trump and he needs to have a publicly released medical exam. First, they got him shot, and now they're upset that there is public sympathy after he wasn't killed.\n\nThe 83-year-old architect of the COVID lockdowns and mask mandates is currently pimping his new book, giving him another excuse for face time in the media which is desperately trying to recapture the initiative after the failed assassination and they will be relentless to do so.\n\n\"Anthony Fauci is arguably the most famous - and most revered - doctor in the world today. His role guiding America sanely and calmly through Covid (and through the torrents of Trump) earned him the trust of millions during one of the most terrifying periods in modern American history,\" reads the Amazon description of \"On Call,\" the recently released memoir.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Never mind that you almost got killed. It's only a scratch, get over it.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci downplayed former President Donald Trump's injuries during last weekend's assassination attempt, calling the ear wound he received when he was grazed by a bullet \"superficial.\"\n\nFauci, the embattled former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who advised both Trump and President Biden during the COVID-19 pandemic, was asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer about Trump's injuries.\n\nTrump, 78, dove to the ground after gunfire from would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks erupted and nicked his ear as he spoke at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday. Trump emerged surrounded by Secret Service agents with blood gushing from his right ear and has since worn a bandage over it.\n\n\"I don't think there is much more to it,\" Fauci said on Friday night. \"I mean, from what we've seen and what we've heard, it was a bullet shot that grazed his ear and injured his ear, according to the physicians who examined him. There was no other further damage.\"\n\nThere are a great many people who've been questioning just how severe Trump's wound is. Or even if there's any damage whatsoever. I mean, it's not like his head was blown off or anything.\n\nWhich led to this response and Sarah's reply.\n\nNow, I don't know anyone who got shot in the ear and nearly killed. But I do know people who've had MOHS surgeries on their ear for skin cancer. Sometimes a pretty significant chunk is removed. No stitches are used. Instead it's bandages with antibiotic ointment for several days or weeks until everything is healed. Sometimes it also involves a small bit of plastic surgery to try and repair the site (again, NO STITCHES) with bandages and antibiotics for a period of time until the site is fully healed. Sure, if it was a very minor wound, small stitches could be used. But this was a BULLET wound, which is a very different animal!\n\nBack to our resident troll Fauci. It's only a minor flesh wound he claims!\n\nBLITZER: What more does the public need to know about the extent of Donald Trump's injuries and his treatment?\n\nFAUCI: You know, I don't think there is much more to it. I mean, from what we've seen and what we've heard, it was, it was a bullet shot that grazed his ear and injured his ear, according to the physicians who examined him. There was no other further damage.\n\nSo I think that with regard to the health related purely to the bullet itself, I think he's he's in the clear as far as I can see. I mean, it's dangerous to make diagnoses from a distance from what I'm seeing, the way he's acting now and what his physicians report saw. It seems to have been a superficial wound to the ear, and that's all.\n\nThis coming from the guy who undercut Trump on everything related to the Covid response and is absolutely gleeful I'm sure that the 'inject with bleach' falsehood is making the rounds again.\n\nYet here's Fauci claiming that, while he can't diagnose from a distance, President Trump's wound is only a scratch.\n\nThey only got along well while Trump and everyone around him bought into Fauci's so-called \"expertise\" on Covid and never questioned his assertions. Once the questions started, Fauci along with Birx worked to undermine Trump and the Administration's response. Fauci has now admitted as much during testimony and speeches.\n\nYet here's Fauci telling us that Trump just needs to get over it. It's only a scratch, as if he just accidentally scraped his head with a speeding bullet for shits and giggles.\n\nNever mind that a near miss on one's life can potentially cause other trauma, or introspection.\n\n\"The concern is that gunshot blasts near the head can cause injuries that aren't immediately noticeable, such as bleeding in or on the brain, damage to the inner ear, or even psychological trauma,\" Gupta explained.\n\nCNN reported that the neurosurgeon as stressing that a \"thorough evaluation\" following a gunshot wound could provide a clearer understanding of both physical and mental injuries, aiding in a quicker recovery.\n\n\"The good news is that most physical symptoms of an injury would probably have revealed themselves over the past few days,\" Gupta concluded. \"At this point, however, the Trump campaign hasn't yet shared whether a full workup was done at the time or if there has been any follow-up since.\"\n\nI do have to chuckle at the fact that everyone is demanding that Trump and his team provide DETAILED medical information immediately, yet were and are the very same people who've not asked for anything regarding Joe Biden's neurological issues. Or if they have, once they were told no, they've backed down.\n\nThis country, whether Democrats want to believe it or not, is damned lucky that President Trump is alive, because that scratch could've had world-wide repercussions if the shooter had been successful.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

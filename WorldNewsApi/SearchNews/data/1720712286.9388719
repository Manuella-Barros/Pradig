Having gone unbeaten for two consecutive Kenya Cup seasons, they are set to face their eternal rivals, KCB Rugby, in the 85th Enterprise Cup final at the RFUEA Grounds on Saturday, 8 June 2024. The team from Kakamega has been in scintillating form, clinching the 2023 Kenya Cup title unbeaten. They continued their dominance by staging a dramatic comeback to edge out KCB with a 30-27 victory in last year\u2019s Enterprise Cup final. This season, Kabras Sugar replicated their flawless league performance, winning the 2024 Kenya Cup again without suffering a defeat. Their upcoming clash against KCB is not just a battle for the prestigious Enterprise Cup but also an opportunity for Kabras Sugar to complete the perfect league and cup double for the second consecutive year. Standing in their way is KCB, a team that once held the upper hand in their rivalry. The stage is set for an exhilarating encounter as Kabras Sugar aim to extend their unbeaten streak and solidify their legacy in Kenyan rugby history. Speaking to Citizen Digital after his side\u2019s 54-8 semifinal win over 25 time champions Nondescripts, Kabras Sugar Head Coach Carlos Katywa said, \u201d \u201cIt will be a big game. KCB is fortunate to have been playing Enterprise for two games, unlike us who only had the semis. They have a fully fit, fledged side, so it\u2019s going to be an interesting one. We have to be smart about how we go about business with them.\u201d KCB Assistant Coach, Mariko Mshilla, speaking after the team\u2019s 32-18 semifinal win over Kenya Harlequin last weekend said, \u201d \u201cIt has been two weeks before we played a match and I could not be prouder of the team for executing our game plan. The boys looked a bit rusty but we will embark on a rigorous training next week ahead of the showdown. I am optimistic that we will take a stab on the sixth title and win it.\u201d Kabras Sugar will be gunning for their fourth title in a row, having won in 2019,2022 and 2023 while KCB are out for a sixth title, having won in 2004, 2007,2015,2016 and 2017. Both sides have announced their match day squads for the clash that will be preceded by the KRU Nationwide League final between Zetech Oaks and TUM Marines at 1.00pm at the same venue. Victor Oduor takes charge of this match with Innocent Kimathi and Kevin Wambugu serving as the assistant referees. Ticket charges are Ksh 500 and the match will be streamed live on Kenya Rugby YouTube. https://apo-opa.co/3KwirZY How they line up Kabras Sugar: 15. Eric Cantona, 14. Alfred Orege, 13.

For many, the solstice marks the first official day of summer.\n\nNorth Texans have already felt their fare share of summertime heat over June, with over a dozen days above 90 degrees. The rest of the summer is going to be a hot one for the region, as above-normal temperatures are expected for the next couple months.\n\nTemperatures on the summer solstice in Dallas-Fort Worth will be in the low to mid-90s, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the summer solstice:\n\nWhat is the summer solstice?\n\nThe summer solstice is an annual event that occurs when the path of the sun is furthest north in the northern hemisphere, according to Britannica.\n\nDuring the solstice, the North Pole is tilted about 23.4 degrees towards the sun. Because of this tilt and being so close to the sun, the solstice marks the longest day and shortest night of the year.\n\nThe summer solstice also marks the first day of summer.\n\nWhen does the summer solstice occur?\n\nThe summer solstice doesn't occur on the same day every year.\n\nInstead, the summer solstice can occur on either June 20-21 every year, according to Space.com.\n\nHow much daylight will Dallas-Fort Worth have on the summer solstice?\n\nThe Metroplex will have 14 hours, 18 minutes and 37 seconds of daylight on summer solstice day, according to Time and Date.\n\nJune 20 will mark the longest day of the year, and every day past that, will see daylight decrease by mere seconds until the winter solstice on Dec. 21.\n\nIs the summer solstice the official first day of summer?\n\nFor those that recognize the summer solstice, yes, but for meteorologists, no.\n\nMeteorologists break the seasons into three-month groupings, with the summer season being June 1 to August 31, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThis method was made to mirror the actual calendar and stay consistent, as each season lasts around 90-92 days.\n\nMeteorological spring is from March-May, summer from June-August, fall from September-November and winter from December-February.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brayden_garcia@star-telegram.com", "name": "Brayden Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Employment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/djn159/picture278839419/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/CT_heat04.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "dateEnd": "-08-31", "textStart": 1903, "textEnd": 1922}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "dateEnd": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 1277, "textEnd": 1287}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 93, "textEnd": 100, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-21", "textStart": 1665, "textEnd": 1672}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Then this could be the best day of the year for you and your fellow sunlight seekers.\n\nThe summer solstice is Thursday, June 20. It's the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. It's also the first official day of summer.\n\nOur ancient ancestors certainly took note of the yearly occasion. Some of their monuments were aligned to precisely mark the summer solstice light (looking at you Stonehenge).\n\nPagan celebrations of the day carry on into modern times. Events include gatherings at Stonehenge in England, the Midsummer Eve celebration in Sweden and Ivan Kupala Night in parts of Eastern Europe.\n\nThe mirror image of the winter solstice, the summer solstice is historically linked to fertility - both the plant and human variety - in destinations worldwide.\n\nThe science of the solstice and its traditions have fascinated people for millennia.\n\nSummer solstice science\n\nIs it summer solstice all over the world? No. It's only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world's population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there.\n\nWhen is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that's 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool.\n\nWho gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador's capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight.\n\nBut residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn't get that dark. The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They'll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order.\n\nWhy don't we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That's because the Earth is aligned on an axis, an imaginary pole going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts - at an angle of 23.5 degrees.\n\n\"As Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun's direct rays,\" explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that's the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox.\n\nIs this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it's not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US.\n\n\"On average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\" says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward.\n\n\"Temperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night - so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\" says Ward. \"The only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\" because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August.\n\nThe same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe.\n\nHow to celebrate summer solstice\n\nWhat does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically.\n\nThe central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times.\n\nThe English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise.\n\nWhat other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day.\n\nIn Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night - a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires.\n\nIn India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations' International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

The summer solstice is today, Thursday, June 20.\n\nAlthough the summer solstice marks the official first day of summer, it doesn't necessarily bring a wave of instant heat with it. The weather has nothing to do with the solstice, even if it happens to be hotter on the day of.\n\nHere's why some people think that the summer solstice is like an \"on\" switch for instant heat and a little bit about the difference between solstices and equinoxes.\n\nThe summer solstice marks the start of the summer, but is not typically the hottest day of the year, which is a common misconception because of its \"start of summer\" title. The hottest days of the year usually follow close behind the solstice, though.\n\nFor example, the hottest days of the year in 2023 in Florida were in early July, just a couple of weeks after the 2023 summer solstice, which was on Wednesday, June 21.\n\n\"The hottest days are after the June solstice in the Northern Hemisphere,\" according to EarthSky.\n\n\"The phenomenon of the hottest weather following the summer solstice by a month or two is called the lag of the seasons.\"\n\nThe solstice isn't the hottest point of the summer, but it is a harbinger of the hottest days of the year, which are usually in July and August.\n\nNo. The days start getting longer and closer to summertime daylight hours during the spring, when we \"spring forward\" in places that observe daylight saving time.\n\nFollowing the summer solstice, the days start to get shorter little by little until the autumnal equinox, which usually falls in September.\n\nThere are two equinoxes and two solstices each year. Equinoxes occur during the fall and spring and are called the autumnal and vernal equinoxes.\n\nThey mark the first day of spring and the first day of fall each year. Solstices occur during the winter and summer and mark the shortest and longest days of the year, respectively. The summer solstice is considered the first day of summer and the winter solstice is considered the first day of winter.\n\n\"The summer solstice occurs at the moment the earth's tilt toward/from the sun is at a maximum. Therefore, on the day of the summer solstice, the sun appears at its highest elevation with a noontime position that changes very little for several days before and after the summer solstice,\" according to the National Weather Service.\n\nEquinoxes are the only two times of the year when the earth's axis isn't tilted toward or away from the sun, which results in a \"nearly\" equal amount of daylight and darkness at all latitudes, according to NWS.\n\n\"At the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on these two equinoxes,\" NWS says. \"The 'nearly' equal hours of day and night are due to refraction of sunlight or a bending of the light's rays that causes the sun to appear above the horizon when the actual position of the sun is below the horizon.\"\n\nThe summer solstice is on a Thursday this year, on June 20 at 4:51 p.m. EDT. It is the longest day of the year.\n\nThe next solstice or equinox will be the autumnal equinox, which typically happens in September.

In addition to being the longest day of the year, it's 6 hours and 24 minutes longer than the shortest day, which is the winter solstice in December.\n\nAll told, there will be 15 hours and 26 minutes between sunrise and sunset on June 20 this year. The summer solstice is also considered the start of summer on the astronomical calendar. Meteorological summer begins on June 1 and runs through the end of August; astronomical summer is June 20 through Sept. 22.\n\nWhat is the summer solstice?\n\nThe summer solstice marks the longest day of the year. During the summer solstice, the Sun is at its highest point in the sky and the Earth's tilt toward the star is at its maximum, according to the National Weather Service. As the days go by, the amount of sunlight will decrease. This culminates with the winter solstice or the shortest day of the year. On the winter solstice, the Earth's tilt is its farthest from the Sun.\n\nWhat makes summer solstice 2024 unique?\n\nThis is the earliest summer solstice in more than two centuries. Specifically, it's the earliest solstice since June 20, 1796, when George Washington was president and there were only 16 states in the Union. The early solstice is due to the complex dance between Earth's yearly orbit around the sun and its daily rotation, along with how we mark the solstice on our calendars. Quirks in the Gregorian calendar mean the solstice will make another jump earlier every leap year until the year 2100.\n\nWho celebrates the solstice?\n\nMany people around the world celebrate the summer solstice with music and festivities. In England, hundreds of people travel to the ancient site Stonehenge for the first day of summer. Solstice observations there have been going on annually for thousands of years.\n\nThe Stonehenge rock formation perfectly aligns with the sun's movement on both the summer and winter solstices. Although its origins and reasons for its creation are not understood, Stonehenge has become one of the most popular places to observe the solstice. The Mayans and Aztecs also used the summer and winter solstices as markers to build structures that precisely line up with shadows created by the sun, according to Scientific American. Keep in mind that Thursday is also the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, meaning winter is coming for the roughly 12% of the world's population who live there.\n\nRochester NY weather forecast\n\nHighs are expected in the 90s through Thursday before dipping to the mid-80s on Friday and Saturday and rising again to the upper 80s on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service in Buffalo. Monday's high is currently expected to hover around 80 degrees. The normal high in Rochester in mid-June is in the upper 70s.\n\nThings to do in Rochester NY for the summer solstice\n\nLooking for a way to celebrate the start of summer? There are several events in the Rochester area centered around the longest day of the year. The Rochester Museum and Science Center will hold two sessions of Solstice Yoga Under the Stars at the Strasenburgh Planetarium on June 21. The sessions are at 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., with all proceeds benefiting RMSC's Field Trip Fund program.

The sun will rise at 4.43am.\n\nThe solstice officially marks the beginning of the astronomical summer, which ends when the autumn equinox falls on September 22.\n\nDay and night will be at almost equal length on this date, as the sun crosses the celestial equator and moves southward into the northern hemisphere.\n\nWhat happens during the summer solstice?\n\nThere are two solstices each year - one in the winter and one in the summer. The summer solstice occurs when the tilt of Earth's axis is most inclined towards the sun and is directly above the Tropic of Cancer.\n\nTraditionally, the summer solstice period fell between the planting and harvesting of crops, leaving people who worked the land time to relax. This is why June became the traditional month for weddings.\n\nIt might seem like a day to celebrate, but it actually signals the moment the sun's path stops moving northward in the sky, and the start of days becoming steadily shorter as the slow march towards winter begins.\n\nHowever, we won't notice the days becoming shorter for a while. The shortest day of the year is not until December 21, which is known as the winter solstice.\n\nAt the winter solstice, the Earth's axis is tilted furthest away from the sun directly over the Tropic of Capricorn, bringing only a few hours of daylight.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere the dates of the two solstices are reversed. The winter solstice occurs on the same day in June and the summer solstice the same day in December.\n\nThe term \"solstice\" derives from the Latin word \"solstitium\", meaning \"sun standing still\". Some prefer the more teutonic term \"sunturn\" to describe the event.\n\nAstrologers say the sun seems to \"stand still\" at the point on the horizon where it appears to rise and set, before moving off in the reverse direction.\n\nSummer solstice traditions\n\nOver the centuries, the June solstice has inspired many festivals and midsummer celebrations involving bonfires, picnics, singing, watching the sun rise and Maypole dancing. Many towns and villages across Britain still mark the day.\n\nOne ritual was the lighting of fires, heralding the start of shorter days, although this does not happen often anymore. The idea was that flames would keep the dark away.\n\nHow to celebrate the summer solstice\n\nStonehenge always welcomes an influx of garland-wearing hippies, druids and curious tourists who head to the mysterious stone circles and wait for the sun to appear.\n\nCrowds of around 10,000 traditionally greet the moment dawn breaks, as the sun rises behind the Heel Stone, the ancient entrance to the Stone Circle, with a mixture of cheers and silent meditation each June.\n\nThe Golowan Festival showcases bright parades with festival-goers dancing the Serpent Dance to the sound of the Golowan Band. There are also Golowan workshops in the run-up to the festival, where those celebrating can engage in various activities such as costume, mask and headdress-making.\n\nOther activities to get you in the summer spirit include model boat making to sail at the boating pool event on Quay Fair Day, banner making, practising circus skills, and a photography town trail.\n\nWhy is Stonehenge so significant to the summer solstice?\n\nStonehenge in Amesbury, Wiltshire, is the most popular place for Pagans to celebrate the longest day because it famously aligns to the solstices. The rising sun only reaches the middle of the stones one day of the year when it shines on the central altar.\n\nBuilt in three phases between 3,000 B.C. and 1,600 B.C, Stonehenge's exact purpose still remains a mystery. The stones were brought from very long distances - the bluestones from the Preseli Hills more than 150 miles away, and the sarsens probably from the Marlborough Downs, 19 miles to the north.\n\nThe day marks the ancient middle of summer. It has significance for pagans who have always believed that midsummer day holds a special power.\n\nMidsummer's eve was believed to be a time when the veil between this world and the next was at its thinnest, and when fairies were thought to be at their most powerful.\n\nWhat is the connection to midsummer?\n\nMidsummer is a separate event to the summer solstice. This year, midsummer is to be held on Saturday 24 June 2023.\n\nReferencing the time period between the middle of the summer, this celebration predates Christianity and is primarily held close to the summer solstice.\n\nTraditionally a quarter day - when servants were hired, school terms started and rents were due - midsummer bonfires are still lit on some hills in Cornwall. Bonfires were also typical of Golowan, the festival now celebrated in Penzance, Cornwall, as they signified the Feast of St John (Gol-Jowan).", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

No. It's only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world's population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there.When is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that's 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool.Who gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador's capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight.But residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn't get that dark. The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They'll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order.Why don't we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That's because the Earth is aligned on an axis, an imaginary pole going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts - at an angle of 23.5 degrees.\"As Earth orbits the sun , its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun's direct rays,\" explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that's the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox.Is this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it's not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the U.S.\"On average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\" says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward.\"Temperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night - so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\" says Ward. \"The only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\" because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August.The same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe.How to celebrate summer solsticeWhat does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically.The central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times.The English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise.What other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day.In Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night - a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires.In India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations' International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.\n\nDo you yearn for long days and short nights?

People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there.\n\nWhen is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that's 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool.\n\nWho gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador's capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight.\n\nBut residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn't get that dark. The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They'll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order.\n\nWhy don't we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That's because the Earth is aligned on an axis, an imaginary pole going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts - at an angle of 23.5 degrees.\n\n\"As Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun's direct rays,\" explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that's the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox.\n\nIs this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it's not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US.\n\n\"On average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\" says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward.\n\n\"Temperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night - so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\" says Ward. \"The only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\" because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August.\n\nWhat does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically.\n\nThe central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times.\n\nThe English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise.\n\nWhat other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day.\n\nIn Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night - a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires.\n\nIn India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations' International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At the winter solstice in December, that will be down to around nine hours and 43 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe summer solstice, also known as the festival solstice or midsummer, occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. It happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere (Northern and Southern). For that hemisphere, the summer solstice is when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky and is the day with the longest period of daylight. Within the Arctic circle (for the northern hemisphere) or Antarctic circle (for the southern hemisphere), there is continuous daylight around the summer solstice.

Likewise, the Sun's declination from the celestial equator is 23.44\u00b0.\n\nThe summer solstice occurs during summer. This is the June solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the December solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. The same dates in the opposite hemisphere are referred to as the winter solstice.\n\nSince prehistory, the summer solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures, and has been marked by festivals and rituals.

Stonehenge is believed to have been constructed with a specific alignment to the summer solstice sunrise.\n\nSo what is the significance of summer solstice, which marks the longest day of the year?\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nThe 2024 summer solstice falls on Thursday, June 20 at 20:50 GMT. People across the Northern Hemisphere will experience the solstice at the same moment.\n\nThe Northern Hemisphere's summer solstice typically falls between June 20 to 22. This year's solstice is the earliest in 228 years, it last occurred on June 20, 1796.\n\nThe last June 22 solstice was in 1975 - since then and until last year, it had been occurring on June 21.\n\nShifts in the date occur because the time the Earth takes to orbit around the sun each year does not exactly align with our calendar year.\n\nAlthough the orbital cycle and Earth's tilt on its axis remain relatively constant over short periods, gradual, natural variations create a slight change in the solstice date every few decades.\n\nDuring the summer solstice, the Northern Hemisphere will experience the longest period of sunlight in a day or the longest day of the year.\n\nThis is due to Earth's position in its orbit around the sun and the way the North Pole is tilted closest to the sun during the summer solstice. The sun's rays hit the Northern Hemisphere at their most direct angle, resulting in the most extended period of daylight.\n\nAreas further away from the equator will experience longer daylight hours than those that are closer. For instance, parts of India closer to the equator will experience nearly 14 hours of daylight.\n\nThe Arctic Circle will experience a polar day, also known as midnight sun with 24 hours of sunlight.\n\nDespite the long hours of sunlight, it will not be the hottest day of the year.\n\nThis is due to a concept called \"seasonal lag\". The Earth and its atmosphere take time to warm up. This is similar to how the hottest part of the day is usually in the afternoon, not at noon when the sun is highest in the sky.\n\nThe oceans, which cover about 70 percent of the Earth's surface, absorb, store, and release heat slowly. The warming of the oceans contributes to the overall delay in reaching peak temperatures.\n\nThe hottest days of the summer will likely occur over several weeks after the summer solstice, often in July or August in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe heat from long daylight hours will have accumulated on the earth. Additionally, even though the days start to get shorter immediately after the solstice, they are still quite long and the sun remains relatively high in the sky, which means the solar energy received remains substantial.\n\nThe Earth's surface and atmosphere are efficient at absorbing this solar energy but release heat gradually.\n\nDue to such factors, temperatures will continue to rise until late July or August, when the energy balance tips towards more energy being lost than gained.\n\nFrom India to Greece and the US, heatwaves have seared several countries across the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nA heatwave is marked by at least two or more days of unusually high temperatures compared with typical averages in a location during that period or month.\n\nA heatwave in the northeast US, for example, is when the temperature reaches or exceeds 32.2 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit) for three consecutive days.\n\nIn India, a heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature reaches at least 40C (104F) in the plains, or 30C (86F) in hilly regions, according to India's meteorological department.\n\nIn the US, heat domes - high-pressure masses of trapped hot air - are exacerbating heatwaves.\n\nHumidity can also make certain areas feel hotter.\n\nAt the same moment as the summer solstice in the north, the Southern Hemisphere will experience the winter solstice.\n\nThis is because the seasons are reversed there, so while the astronomical start of summer occurs in the north, the astronomical winter kicks off in the south.\n\nAstronomical events relate to the Earth's position in space, whereas the meteorological start of a season is based on the calendar year and the annual temperature cycle.\n\nThe Southern Hemisphere will experience its shortest day of the year, or the one with the least duration of sunlight.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midnight sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prehistory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seasonal lag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arctic Circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Academic Departments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP23174549004400-1718815568.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "dateEnd": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1249, "textEnd": 1262}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1073, "textEnd": 1080}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1360, "textEnd": 1367}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 1448, "textEnd": 1455}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 1335, "textEnd": 1342}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

This year, the summer solstice occurs on June 20 at approximately 3:50 p.m. CT in Chicago. On this day, the Chicago area will experience the most daylight of the year, with around 15 hours, 13 minutes, and 41 seconds of sunlight. It is also a day when shadows are at their shortest.\n\nThe summer solstice is a significant event as it is when the sun reaches its highest and northernmost points in the sky. This marks the first day of astronomical summer and is known for having the longest period of sunlight, making it the longest day of the year for those in the Northern Hemisphere. The solstice typically falls between June 20-22 each year due to the Earth's tilt in relation to its orbit around the sun.\n\nIn 2024, the summer solstice is the earliest it has been in over 200 years. This early timing has been attributed to various factors, including it being a leap year. As a result of the Earth's tilt and orbit, the amount of daylight increases leading up to the summer solstice and gradually decreases afterward until the winter solstice on December 21.\n\nThe term \"solstice\" comes from Latin origins, meaning that the arc of the Sun stops in the sky. It signifies the sun's highest point in the sky during the summer solstice. While the solstice marks the day with the most sunlight, it does not coincide with the earliest sunrise or latest sunset of the year.\n\nFollowing the summer solstice is the June full moon, also known as the \"strawberry moon.\" This full moon will be visible on June 21 at 8:08 p.m. CT, coinciding with the summer solstice. The alignment of the full moon with the solstice creates a unique astronomical event, where the moon will appear larger due to its low position in the sky.\n\nIf you are interested in witnessing the sunrise on the summer solstice, you don't have to travel far. Popular spots like North Avenue Beach in Chicago offer picturesque views of the sunrise over Lake Michigan. Additionally, there are several other locations across the U.S. where you can experience the sunrise, including Lake Tahoe, Grand Canyon National Park, and Key West, Florida.\n\nAs we celebrate the 2024 summer solstice and the arrival of the strawberry moon, take a moment to appreciate the natural beauty and astronomical wonders that occur during this time of year.

For the northern hemisphere, the 2024 summer solstice falls on June 20 at 4:54 p.m. ET.\n\nWhile it's often referred to as the longest day, the solstice is more precisely the most daylight, as all days have 24 hours. The exact amount of daylight depends on latitude, with extreme northern locations experiencing the midnight sun, where the sun never fully sets.\n\nThe amount of daylight will remain roughly steady for a few days before it slowly begins to decrease until the winter solstice, which marks the fewest hours of daylight of the year.\n\nThe solstice also marks the start of astronomical summer. If the current heatwave has you feeling like summer is already here, that's because meteorological summer, which marks the three hottest months of the year, began at the start of June.\n\nThe solstice is something that has been observed by humans since ancient times, with monuments like Stonehenge having been built to align with the sun on the summer and winter solstices.\n\nEven today, hundreds of people will gather at sites like Stonehenge to observe the day. In other places, the solstice is celebrated with bonfires and festivals like Sweden's Midsommar.\n\nThe reason this year's solstice is the earliest since 1796 is because of the way the calendar is designed. The Earth doesn't orbit the sun in precisely 365 days, so the Gregorian calendar adds leap years every four years, inserting an extra day in the calendar to keep things on track.\n\nBut there's a quirk in how leap years are calculated. Years that begin with 00 are only leap years if the year is also divisible by 400. Over the course of 400 years, that means the planet loses three leap years, shifting time slightly and making things too fast by about 45 minutes.\n\nThat means the solstice this year is about 45 minutes earlier than previous years. It's a trend that will continue until 2096, the solstice creeping earlier with each orbit around the sun until the calendar resets.", "source": {"uri": "wivb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wivb4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jane Austen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midnight sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leap year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midsummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bonfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars_and_Timekeeping", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars and Timekeeping", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.wivb.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/97/2024/06/6f7998b65a434f609a3333159238f151.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 309, "textEnd": 316}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

According to Sky History, the term \"solstice\" originates from two Latin words, \"sun\" and \"standstill,\" showcasing the sun's delayed appearance in the sky. The \"solstice pause\" marks an eagerness to grasp the summer sun a little longer, before our short days take over.\n\nFor Utah, the sun rose at 5:56 a.m. and will set Thursday at 9:02 p.m., making the peak of the solstice at 2:50 p.m. This gives Utahns 15 hours and 6 minutes of daylight.

This is not a rare event, but it is certainly one of the most interesting annual astrological events. It is summer solstice. At this point, the sun will reach its highest point in the sky as it will be directly above the Tropic of Cancer. It will make the longest day with the shortest night in the northern hemisphere. It will also herald the onset of Cancer season. The summer solstice holds astrological significance and the people have been observing certain rituals from the pre-historic period.\n\nReason behind solsticesAs the Earth spins on an axis that is tilted 23.5 degrees away from vertical, the sun's height in the sky each day changes. So, the hemispheres lean either toward or away from the sun, it depends on the time of year. When the northern half of the planet leans toward the sun, there is a summer season. On the other hand, when the southern half of the planet leans away from the sun, there is a winter season.\n\nSpring and Autumn Equinoxes\n\nIt is also important that between the summer solstice and the winter solstice, people have been observing the spring and autumn equinoxes from time immemorial. They celebrate it as a festival when sunlight and night are evenly distributed.\n\nStonehenge\n\nThousands of people are expected to reach Stonehenge in England to celebrate the summer solstice. Celebrations on the occasion of solstice have been held annually for thousands of years.

In addition to being the longest day of the year, it's 6 hours and 24 minutes longer than the shortest day, which is the winter solstice in December.\n\nAll told, there will be 15 hours and 26 minutes between sunrise and sunset on June 20 this year. The summer solstice is also considered the start of summer on the astronomical calendar. Meteorological summer begins on June 1 and runs through the end of August; astronomical summer is June 20 through Sept. 22.\n\nThe summer solstice marks the longest day of the year. During the summer solstice, the Sun is at its highest point in the sky and the Earth's tilt toward the star is at its maximum, according to the National Weather Service. As the days go by, the amount of sunlight will decrease. This culminates with the winter solstice or the shortest day of the year. On the winter solstice, the Earth's tilt is its farthest from the Sun.\n\nThis is the earliest summer solstice in more than two centuries. Specifically, it's the earliest solstice since June 20, 1796, when George Washington was president and there were only 16 states in the Union. The early solstice is due to the complex dance between Earth's yearly orbit around the sun and its daily rotation, along with how we mark the solstice on our calendars. Quirks in the Gregorian calendar mean the solstice will make another jump earlier every leap year until the year 2100.\n\nMany people around the world celebrate the summer solstice with music and festivities. In England, hundreds of people travel to the ancient site Stonehenge for the first day of summer. Solstice observations there have been going on annually for thousands of years.\n\nThe Stonehenge rock formation perfectly aligns with the sun's movement on both the summer and winter solstices. Although its origins and reasons for its creation are not understood, Stonehenge has become one of the most popular places to observe the solstice. The Mayans and Aztecs also used the summer and winter solstices as markers to build structures that precisely line up with shadows created by the sun, according to Scientific American. Keep in mind that Thursday is also the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, meaning winter is coming for the roughly 12% of the world's population who live there.\n\nHighs are expected in the 90s through Thursday before dipping to the mid-80s on Friday and Saturday and rising again to the upper 80s on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service in Buffalo. Monday's high is currently expected to hover around 80 degrees. The normal high in Rochester in mid-June is in the upper 70s.\n\nLooking for a way to celebrate the start of summer? There are several events in the Rochester area centered around the longest day of the year. The Rochester Museum and Science Center will hold two sessions of Solstice Yoga Under the Stars at the Strasenburgh Planetarium on June 21. The sessions are at 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., with all proceeds benefiting RMSC's Field Trip Fund program. While you need to bring your own mat, participants of all abilities are welcome.\n\nMore: Who has the best ice cream in NY?

The full moon, known as the Strawberry Moon, arrives at 9:10 p.m., though moonrise in Rochester is expected at 9:15 p.m.\n\nContributing: Democrat and Chronicle reporter Steve Howe and USA Today

The sun will rise at 4.43am.\n\nThe solstice officially marks the beginning of the astronomical summer, which ends when the autumn equinox falls on September 22.\n\nDay and night will be at almost equal length on this date, as the sun crosses the celestial equator and moves southward into the northern hemisphere.\n\nThere are two solstices each year - one in the winter and one in the summer. The summer solstice occurs when the tilt of Earth's axis is most inclined towards the sun and is directly above the Tropic of Cancer.\n\nTraditionally, the summer solstice period fell between the planting and harvesting of crops, leaving people who worked the land time to relax. This is why June became the traditional month for weddings.\n\nIt might seem like a day to celebrate, but it actually signals the moment the sun's path stops moving northward in the sky, and the start of days becoming steadily shorter as the slow march towards winter begins.\n\nHowever, we won't notice the days becoming shorter for a while. The shortest day of the year is not until December 21, which is known as the winter solstice.\n\nAt the winter solstice, the Earth's axis is tilted furthest away from the sun directly over the Tropic of Capricorn, bringing only a few hours of daylight.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere the dates of the two solstices are reversed. The winter solstice occurs on the same day in June and the summer solstice the same day in December.\n\nThe term \"solstice\" derives from the Latin word \"solstitium\", meaning \"sun standing still\". Some prefer the more teutonic term \"sunturn\" to describe the event.\n\nAstrologers say the sun seems to \"stand still\" at the point on the horizon where it appears to rise and set, before moving off in the reverse direction.\n\nOver the centuries, the June solstice has inspired many festivals and midsummer celebrations involving bonfires, picnics, singing, watching the sun rise and Maypole dancing. Many towns and villages across Britain still mark the day.\n\nOne ritual was the lighting of fires, heralding the start of shorter days, although this does not happen often anymore. The idea was that flames would keep the dark away.\n\nStonehenge always welcomes an influx of garland-wearing hippies, druids and curious tourists who head to the mysterious stone circles and wait for the sun to appear.\n\nCrowds of around 10,000 traditionally greet the moment dawn breaks, as the sun rises behind the Heel Stone, the ancient entrance to the Stone Circle, with a mixture of cheers and silent meditation each June.\n\nThe Golowan Festival showcases bright parades with festival-goers dancing the Serpent Dance to the sound of the Golowan Band. There are also Golowan workshops in the run-up to the festival, where those celebrating can engage in various activities such as costume, mask and headdress-making.\n\nOther activities to get you in the summer spirit include model boat making to sail at the boating pool event on Quay Fair Day, banner making, practising circus skills, and a photography town trail.\n\nStonehenge in Amesbury, Wiltshire, is the most popular place for Pagans to celebrate the longest day because it famously aligns to the solstices. The rising sun only reaches the middle of the stones one day of the year when it shines on the central altar.\n\nBuilt in three phases between 3,000 B.C. and 1,600 B.C, Stonehenge's exact purpose still remains a mystery. The stones were brought from very long distances - the bluestones from the Preseli Hills more than 150 miles away, and the sarsens probably from the Marlborough Downs, 19 miles to the north.\n\nThe day marks the ancient middle of summer. It has significance for pagans who have always believed that midsummer day holds a special power.\n\nMidsummer's eve was believed to be a time when the veil between this world and the next was at its thinnest, and when fairies were thought to be at their most powerful.\n\nMidsummer is a separate event to the summer solstice. This year, midsummer is to be held on Saturday 24 June 2023.\n\nReferencing the time period between the middle of the summer, this celebration predates Christianity and is primarily held close to the summer solstice.\n\nTraditionally a quarter day - when servants were hired, school terms started and rents were due - midsummer bonfires are still lit on some hills in Cornwall. Bonfires were also typical of Golowan, the festival now celebrated in Penzance, Cornwall, as they signified the Feast of St John (Gol-Jowan).", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Thursday's summer solstice -- the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere -- is the earliest in 228 years, since 1796, when George Washington was president.\n\nThe 2024 summer solstice arrives June 20 at 4:51 p.m. Eastern time (12:51 p.m. Alaska time), according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. A day later, on June 21, the full moon will rise at 9:08 p.m. Eastern. The \"strawberry moon\" is the lowest full moon of the year, staying close to the horizon as the sun soars to its highest point in the sky.\n\nIn most years, the summer solstice occurs on June 21. That's when Earth's North Pole reaches its maximum tilt toward the sun, and the sun appears at its northernmost point directly over the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees north of Earth's equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun takes its longest and highest path through the sky, which is why we experience our longest daylight hours and shortest night of the year.\n\nDaylight hours on the summer solstice depend on latitude: The closer you move toward the North Pole, the more time the sun spends above the horizon. The sun is up for 16 hours in Seattle, but only 13 hours and 45 minutes in Miami.\n\nWashington, D.C., sees about 14 hours, 54 minutes of daylight on the summer solstice, with sunrise at 5:42 a.m. and sunset at 8:36 p.m., according to timeanddate.com.\n\nTwo ways to observe the solstice directly are by watching your shadow as well as the location of sunrise and sunset. The high arc of the sun means you will cast your shortest midday shadow of the year on the summer solstice. You will also see the sun rise and set at its northernmost points along the horizon.\n\nThe main reason for the early solstice is that human calendars aren't perfect. While a normal year (or non-leap year) has 365 days, Earth's orbit around the sun each year is not exactly that long. On average, it takes about 365 days, 5 hours and 49 minutes -- or 365.24219 days, according to timeanddate.com. To account for that extra quarter-day, the Gregorian calendar we adopted in the late 16th century adds one extra day (Feb. 29) to the calendar every four years. This is why we have leap years that are 366 days long.\n\nDuring leap years such as 2024, the solstices and equinoxes occur about 18 hours and 11 minutes earlier than the previous year. Then, during successive non-leap years, the seasons begin 0.24219 days later than the previous year (approximately 5 hours and 49 minutes).\n\nOver time, this means that the solstices and equinoxes drift earlier by about 45 minutes every four years, or about three-quarters of a day per century. By 2096, the solstice will occur at its earliest time of this century.\n\nTo correct this discrepancy, the Gregorian calendar introduced a special rule: Any year divisible by four is a leap year, except for century years, which can only be leap years if they are divisible by 400. Therefore, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2100 are not.\n\nSkipping three leap years every 400 years means the average length of the Gregorian calendar we use is 365.2425 days instead of 365.25 days. Those extra decimal places may not sound like a lot, but they keep our calendar in sync with the actual time it takes Earth to orbit the sun (365.24219 days).\n\nWithout this calibration, the solstices would move earlier indefinitely. Instead, the solstices (and equinoxes) will arrive earlier with each passing leap year until the end of the 21st century. However, the cycle will eventually reset. Because 2100 is not a leap year, the time of the solstice will start to drift later again.\n\nEarth's seasons occur because the planet is tilted on its axis by about 23.5 degrees, which causes each hemisphere to receive different amounts of sunlight throughout the year.\n\nIn June, the Northern Hemisphere leans toward the sun, bringing us more direct sunlight and warmer weather. In the Southern Hemisphere, the June solstice is the first day of winter and the shortest day of the year. Halfway between the winter and summer solstices are the equinoxes, when the length of day and night are nearly equal everywhere on Earth.\n\nWhile the summer solstice marks the first day of astronomical summer, meteorologists define summer as the warmest three calendar months of the year, spanning June, July and August. In most of North America, the warmest three months of the year are more closely aligned with meteorological summer (June 1 to Aug. 31) than astronomical summer, according to climatologist Brian Brettschneider.\n\nThe hottest stretch of the year typically doesn't arrive until the second half of July for much of the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This seasonal lag happens because the amount of solar energy arriving at the ground is greater than the amount leaving the Earth for several weeks after the solstice. It's largely driven by the oceans, which take longer than land to warm up and cool down, and release heat slowly over time.\n\nYet even as summer heat starts to ramp up, we'll slowly start to lose daylight after Thursday's solstice.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice",

Thursday's summer solstice -- the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere -- is the earliest in 228 years, since 1796, when George Washington was president.\n\nThe 2024 summer solstice arrives June 20 at 1:51 p.m. Pacific time, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. A day later, on June 21, the full moon will rise in the evening. The \"strawberry moon\" is the lowest full moon of the year, staying close to the horizon as the sun soars to its highest point in the sky.\n\nWhat exactly happens on the solstice?\n\nIn most years, the summer solstice occurs on June 21. That's when Earth's North Pole reaches its maximum tilt toward the sun, and the sun appears at its northernmost point directly over the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees north of Earth's equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun takes its longest and highest path through the sky, which is why we experience our longest daylight hours and shortest night of the year.\n\nDaylight hours on the summer solstice depend on latitude: The closer you move toward the North Pole, the more time the sun spends above the horizon. The sun is up for 16 hours in Seattle, but only 13 hours and 45 minutes in Miami.\n\nTwo ways to observe the solstice directly are by watching your shadow as well as the location of sunrise and sunset. The high arc of the sun means you will cast your shortest midday shadow of the year on the summer solstice. You will also see the sun rise and set at its northernmost points along the horizon.\n\nWhy is the solstice early this year?\n\nThe main reason for the early solstice is that human calendars aren't perfect. While a normal year (or non-leap year) has 365 days, Earth's orbit around the sun each year is not exactly that long. On average, it takes about 365 days, 5 hours and 49 minutes -- or 365.24219 days, according to timeanddate.com. To account for that extra quarter-day, the Gregorian calendar we adopted in the late 16th century adds one extra day (Feb. 29) to the calendar every four years. This is why we have leap years that are 366 days long.\n\nDuring leap years such as 2024, the solstices and equinoxes occur about 18 hours and 11 minutes earlier than the previous year. Then, during successive non-leap years, the seasons begin 0.24219 days later than the previous year (approximately 5 hours and 49 minutes).\n\nOver time, this means that the solstices and equinoxes drift earlier by about 45 minutes every four years, or about three-quarters of a day per century. By 2096, the solstice will occur at its earliest time of this century.\n\nTo correct this discrepancy, the Gregorian calendar introduced a special rule: Any year divisible by four is a leap year, except for century years, which can only be leap years if they are divisible by 400. Therefore, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2100 are not.\n\nSkipping three leap years every 400 years means the average length of the Gregorian calendar we use is 365.2425 days instead of 365.25 days. Those extra decimal places may not sound like a lot, but they keep our calendar in sync with the actual time it takes Earth to orbit the sun (365.24219 days).\n\nWithout this calibration, the solstices would move earlier indefinitely. Instead, the solstices (and equinoxes) will arrive earlier with each passing leap year until the end of the 21st century. However, the cycle will eventually reset. Because 2100 is not a leap year, the time of the solstice will start to drift later again.\n\nThe reason for the seasons\n\nEarth's seasons occur because the planet is tilted on its axis by about 23.5 degrees, which causes each hemisphere to receive different amounts of sunlight throughout the year.\n\nIn June, the Northern Hemisphere leans toward the sun, bringing us more direct sunlight and warmer weather. In the Southern Hemisphere, the June solstice is the first day of winter and the shortest day of the year. Halfway between the winter and summer solstices are the equinoxes, when the length of day and night are nearly equal everywhere on Earth.\n\nWhile the summer solstice marks the first day of astronomical summer, meteorologists define summer as the warmest three calendar months of the year, spanning June, July and August. In most of North America, the warmest three months of the year are more closely aligned with meteorological summer (June 1 to Aug. 31) than astronomical summer, according to climatologist Brian Brettschneider.\n\nThe hottest stretch of the year typically doesn't arrive until the second half of July for much of the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This seasonal lag happens because the amount of solar energy arriving at the ground is greater than the amount leaving the Earth for several weeks after the solstice. It's largely driven by the oceans, which take longer than land to warm up and cool down, and release heat slowly over time.\n\nYet even as summer heat starts to ramp up, we'll slowly start to lose daylight after Thursday's solstice.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While the June solstice or the summer solstice (it denotes the day with the longest daylight) is the event of the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere has its winter solstice or the northern solstice, which is the day with the shortest period of daylight. To sum it up, the solstices take place twice a year and mark the change of season. It features the shortest and longest daylight hours of the year in the hemispheres.\n\nThe summer solstice takes place when one of the poles of the Earth is tilted to its maximum towards the Sun. On this day, the tropic of Cancer is tilted towards the Sun, which places the giant star constantly above the horizon and it does not set below the horizon at the Arctic Circle. It takes place twice in a year, once in each hemisphere and it is the day with the longest period of daylight and also the year's shortest night. Also, it results in the shortest day of the year in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe summer solstice signals the arrival of summer in many places. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is also known as the June solstice and it takes place on June 20 or 21. In the Southern Hemisphere, it is known as the December solstice and it takes place on December 21 or 22. The summer solstice has been a significant cultural moment in many countries since ancient times and many festivals and rituals are held on that occasion. In temperate regions, especially in Europe, the summer solstice marks the middle of summer and is also known as midsummer.\n\nThere are many monuments in Europe built in ancient times and also in Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas which are aligned with the summer solstice's sunrise or sunset. While its significance varies from one culture to another, many countries celebrate the occasion with holidays, festivals, and rituals around that time with themes of fertility.\n\nThis year in India, the summer solstice is going to take place on June 21 at 8:09 pm IST.

After that, the days will begin getting shorter as we make our way toward winter.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere, June 20 is the shortest day of the year. Earth has seasons because it's tilted, so light from the sun changes throughout the year differently for different parts of the world.\n\nUsually it's a decent rule of thumb that seasons start on the 21st of the appropriate month, but that's not always the case -- and this year's precise moment of solstice is particularly early. The simplest reason why is that 2024 is a leap year. As the Washington Post explains, \"During leap years such as 2024, the solstices and equinoxes occur about 18 hours and 11 minutes earlier than the previous year.\" During non-leap years, the timing of the solstice moves later, so things generally balance out over time.\n\nThe question of who first figured out that the longest day of the year corresponds to the sun's highest point in the sky is \"spectacularly unanswerable,\" Owen Gingerich, Professor Emeritus of Astronomy and History of Science at Harvard University, told TIME in 2016. \"No writing to record this great discovery. Lost in the mists of time!\"\n\nRead more: Photographing The Longest Day Of The Year Inside Rome's Pantheon\n\nAbout 6,000-6,500 years ago, nomadic cattle-herders in southern Egypt are thought to have arranged stones that line up with the path of the solstice sun in the Nabta Playa basin under the Tropic of Cancer. \"[The solstice] was an important touchstone that said, 'Well, the Nile is about to go into its flooding cycle' and that would basically start their calendar,\" as Sten Odenwald, a NASA astronomer, told TIME in 2016.\n\nMore sunlight in a day means more juice for solar panels, boosting electrical supplies in homes with the setup. On social media, lots of solar power companies will likely be taking advantage of the summer solstice to talk up the benefits of this clean energy solution.\n\nThis year, the summer solstice corresponds with a record heat wave in many parts of the U.S., so check out TIME's guide to staying safe. Still, as the New York Times reports, it takes a while for the Earth to heat up each summer, so the hottest temperatures of the year usually take place in July or August.\n\nRead more: See Summer Solstice Celebrations Around the World\n\nGolf clubs across the country are hosting sunrise to sunset golf tournaments this week. For example, at Bandon Dunes in southern Oregon, golfers usually fit in 72 holes of golf from sunrise to sunset.\n\nIn Sweden, there are all kinds of parties celebrating the summer solstice, in which people dance around a maypole with flowers in their hair, eat a lot of smoked fish, and take shots. \"A lot of children are born nine months after Midsummer in Sweden,\" Jan-\u00d6jvind Swahn, a Swedish ethnologist, once told CNN.\n\nIn India, mass yoga sessions take place, drawing hundreds of thousands of participants.

June solstice is TODAY", "body": "This is the earliest date the summer solstice has occurred since 1796\n\nAfter weeks of dreary weather, it won't just be pagans celebrating summer's arrival today.\n\nThe summer solstice today will give Britons their longest day of the year and shortest night, with a full 16 hours and 38 minutes of daylight in London.\n\nAt 21:51 BST this evening, the Northern Hemisphere will be at its most tilted towards the sun, marking the exact peak of the astronomical summer.\n\nBut this year summer has arrived almost a full day early, with today marking the earliest solstice since 1796.\n\nBut, unfortunately, the experts say this won't give us an extra day of summer.\n\nSummer solstice - when Earth's pole is titled at its greatest extent towards the sun - marks the height of the astrological summer and will bring Britain its longest day of the year\n\nRead More Summer on Saturn! NASA captures the changing of the seasons on the ringed planet in an amazing new snapshot from the James Webb Space Telescope\n\nAs the Earth orbits the sun in its yearly cycle, it also turns on its axis exposing different parts to the sun's light - creating the cycle of days and nights.\n\nIf the Earth's axis was directly perpendicular to the sun's rays, every part of the planet would get 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night.\n\nOf course, the Earth does not orbit the sun in this way but is actually tilted on its axis.\n\nDr Daniel Bayliss of Warwick University says: 'Most planets have some tilt with respect to their orbits around the sun.\n\n'The tilt of Earth is likely due to large collisions impacting the young Earth when it was forming in the early solar system.'\n\nThe solstice is the moment at which the Earth is maximally tilted towards the Sun, exposing the Northern hemisphere to sunlight for a bigger part of the Earth's rotation\n\nRead More First 'major lunar standstill' in nearly 20 years set for this weekend\n\nIt is this tilt which gives Earth the regular progression of the seasons and creates the solstice.\n\nJack Foster, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told MailOnline: 'Our planet is tilted on its axis at an angle of 23.4 degrees, and as it orbits the sun sometimes the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun and sometimes it is tilted away.'\n\nThis means that different parts of the planet get different amounts of daylight throughout different parts of the year.\n\nWhen the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun in the summer, we are exposed to daylight for a greater part of the Earth's rotation.\n\nLikewise, in the winter when the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, our days get shorter since we are exposed to the sun for less time.\n\nThis is why regions within the Arctic Circle have 24 hours of daylight during some parts of the year and 24 hours of night at others.\n\nNASA graphic explains the difference between the solstice and the equinox. The solstices take place in June and December; the equinoxes take place in March and September\n\nAt the Summer solstice, the Sun will appear directly overhead at noon from the Tropic of Cancer, reaching its highest point in the sky\n\nSolstices and equinoxes for 2024\n\nSpring equinox - March 20, 03:06 (GMT)\n\nSummer solstice - June 20, 21:51 (BST)\n\nAutumn equinox - September 22, 13:44 (BST)\n\nWinter solstice - December 21, 09:21 (GMT)\n\n(Note that these seasons are for the northern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere, the first equinox of the year marks the start of autumn and the second kicks off spring. Meanwhile, the first solstice kicks off winter and the second kicks off summer.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis tilt gives us the cycle of the seasons, marked by the summer and winter solstices and the 'vernal' and 'autumnal' equinoxes (when night and day are equal length).\n\nIn 2024, the exact moment of the summer solstice will arrive at its earliest in 228 years.\n\nMr Foster says: 'While the summer solstice often occurs on the 21st June, this is not always a given.\n\n'Earth's orbit around the sun does not perfectly align with our calendars, allowing the solstice to shift between the 20th, 21st and 22nd June depending on the year.'\n\nWhile our calendars only have 365 days, the Earth actually takes 365 days, 5 hours and 49 minutes to make its way around the sun or 365.24219 24-hour days.\n\nThat means our calendars actually miss a quarter of a day each year, slowly getting ahead of the actual pattern of the seasons.\n\nOf course, to make up for those leftover quarter days, we add an extra day every four years making it a leap year.\n\nHowever, just adding a leap year still doesn't quite sync up our calendars with the Earth's orbit.\n\nThere are two equinoxes every year - in September and March - when the Sun shines directly on the equator and the length of day and night is nearly equal. During equinoxes, we experience pretty average temperatures and equal lengths of day and night\n\nOn the day of summer solstice 2024 - the longest day of the year - people head to the sea at King Edwards Bay in Tynemouth to celebrate\n\nRead More The seasons affect the way we see COLOUR: Human brain auto-tunes hues as they become more abundant\n\nBy adding an extra day every four years we are pretending that we are losing exactly 0.25 of a day each year - but in reality we are actually losing 0.24219 days.\n\nWhile that might not seem like very much, over decades those decimal places begin to add up and our calendars slowly slip out of alignment.\n\nThis means that, every leap year the solstice gets 45 minutes earlier.\n\nWe correct for this by skipping leap years on century years that aren't divisible by 400 - making 1600 and 2000 leap years but not 1700, 1800, 1900, or 2100.\n\nThis makes the average length of the day every so slightly shorter, fixing our calendar's slipping problem, but it only resets every 400 years.\n\nSo the summer solstice will keep getting earlier every leap year until the calendar resets in 2100.\n\nAt Stonehenge, modern pagans will gather to watch the sun rising through one of the stone arches. Many believe Stonehenge to have been built so that it would align with the seasons\n\nMidsummer is still celebrated around the world. Sweden's flower-themed celebrations were showcased in horrific fashion in the film Midsommar starring Florence Pugh (pictured)\n\nAround the world, the solstice is marked by celebrations due to its close connection to the progress of the seasons.\n\nAt Stonehenge, modern pagans gather to celebrate the celestial event based on a belief that the ancient stone circle was built to align with the seasons.\n\nThe rising sun is framed by one of the stone arches on the morning of the solstice, leading many to suggest that it was built as some sort of calendar or site of seasonal worship.\n\nRead More Summers in the UK could last almost SIX MONTHS by 2100 if we don't implement measures to curb climate change, study warns\n\nAcross the UK there are also several Neolithic burial sites built in such a way that they are fully illuminated by the light of the rising sun on the solstice.\n\nElsewhere around the world there, is also rich evidence of religious practices based around the solstice as well as many festivals which continue to this day\n\nFor instance at the pyramid at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in Mexico, a shadow falls on the ancient temple in the shape of the feathered serpent exactly on the solstice.\n\nAnd across northern countries like Sweden and Latvia, there are still many flower-themed festivals held to mark the day.\n\nHowever, for most people in Britain, the solstice is simply a day to enjoy a bit more sunlight than usual.\n\nThe weather for today will be warm and sunny across most of the UK, but experts say the temperatures will get warmer later on due to seasonal lag\n\nIn London, the sun rose this morning at 04:43 and won't set until 21:21, while in John O'Groats the sun will be up from 04:02 until 22:25.\n\nBut although it is the height of astronomical summer, this does not mean that the day will actually be any warmer.\n\nMr Foster explains: 'Despite the summer solstice providing us with the most solar radiation in a single day, the impact on temperature takes a bit longer to notice.\n\n'This is because it takes time for the Earth's atmosphere to warm up, the effect is not instant.\n\n'We call this \"seasonal lag\", and it means that we tend to experience our hottest temperatures later in the summer once the atmosphere has taken some extra time to heat up.'\n\nSo while the weather forecast for today predicts balmy temperatures across the country, you will have to wait a little while longer for summer to reach its true peak.\n\nOf course, it means that after today the days ever so gradually get shorter, culminating with the winter solstice on December 21 - the shortest day of the year.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

And, the historic moment will also be followed by another big sight in the sky -- the strawberry moon.\n\nThe shortening of the days ahead will be nearly unnoticeable.\n\nFriday, for example, will be only one second shorter than Thursday, according to timeanddate.com. By June 26, the area will see just over a minute less of daylight.\n\nThat trend will continue until the winter solstice in December.\n\nBut despite the shortening of days, the summer solstice doesn't actually mean the area saw its earliest sunrise. That actually fell on June 11-17.\n\nMeanwhile, the sun will continue to set at 8:29 p.m. in the Chicago area through July 2.\n\nThe summer solstice also doesn't mark the day the earth is closest to the sun. In fact, it's the opposite, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnd finally, it won't mean the warmest average temperatures, which typically occur in mid-July.\n\nSo what does the solstice actually mean?\n\nThe summer solstice is the time when the sun reaches its highest and northernmost points in the sky, according to the Farmer's Almanac, marking the first day of astronomical summer.\n\nIt is also known as the day with the longest period of sunlight, or the longest day of the year - for those in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nWhile the solstice does not take place at the same time each year, it typically falls anytime between June 20-22.\n\n\"Our solstices are caused by the slight tilt in Earth's axis in relation to the plane of its orbit,\" a blog from the Adler Planetarium said. \"This tilt is about 23.5 degrees off-vertical. As a result, when Earth circles the Sun each year, a different half of the globe is leaning slightly towards or away from the Sun.\"\n\nAccording to Accuweather, this year's solstice will be the earliest in 228 years, with the last time the solstice taking place this early being on June 20, 1796.\n\n\"The exact day and time of the solstice varies slightly from year to year,\" the publication reported.\n\nWeather Network called the shift for 2024 \"something exceptional,\" noting that the early solstice could also be tied to it being a leap year.\n\n\"Our calendar still remains slightly out of sync with the solar year. As a result, each leap year, the vernal equinox occurs around 40-50 minutes earlier than the previous leap year vernal equinox,\" the network reported.\n\nAlso of note is the fact that the spring equinox fell on March 19, marking only the second time in more than a century it has fallen on that day and becoming the earliest spring equinox in 128 years.\n\n\"Even taking into consideration that there was no daylight saving time back then, 2024's summer solstice is still earlier,\" Weather Network reported.\n\nAnd it appears fall and winter will be similar, with the fall equinox being the earliest since 1797 and the winter solstice becoming the earliest since 1798.\n\nGoing forward, each leap year after 2024 will also see equinoxes and solstices \"even earlier,\" Weather Network said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

This tilt is what gives us our seasons. During the summer solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun at its maximum angle.\n\nThis means we get the most direct sunlight, leading to the longest day and the shortest night of the year.\n\nThe exact date can vary between June 20th, 21st, or 22nd, depending on the year and your time zone. It's important to note that this is the astronomical start of summer, not to be confused with the meteorological start, which is always June 1st for convenience in weather tracking.\n\nDuring the summer solstice, the sun reaches its highest point in the sky in the Northern Hemisphere. This is due to Earth's tilt on its axis as it orbits the sun.\n\nFor a brief period, the sun seems to pause at this peak before it gradually begins its descent, signifying the days will start to get shorter.\n\nThis apparent pause is where the term \"solstice\" comes from, derived from the Latin words \"sol\" (sun) and \"sistere\" (to stand still).\n\nThe summer solstice has been a focal point for celebration and reverence in cultures around the world for millennia. It marks a time of joy, abundance, and a deep connection to the natural world as the Earth basks in the longest hours of daylight.\n\nAncient civilizations recognized the significance of this celestial event, incorporating it into their spiritual practices and even their architecture.\n\nThe Egyptians, for instance, constructed their pyramids so that the sun would align perfectly with specific chambers and passages during the solstices.\n\nThe Mayans, known for their advanced astronomical knowledge, built observatories to track the sun's movements, and their temples were often aligned to the rising or setting sun on the solstices.\n\nStonehenge, the prehistoric monument in England, stands as a testament to humanity's enduring fascination with the solstice. On the morning of the summer solstice, the sun rises precisely over the Heel Stone, a marker outside the main circle of standing stones.\n\nThis alignment is thought to have held profound meaning for the people who built Stonehenge, possibly connected to fertility rites or agricultural cycles.\n\nThere are different traditions and festivals to celebrate summer solstice:\n\nIn Scandinavian countries, Midsummer is a major celebration. This festive occasion marks the summer solstice with various traditions and activities.\n\nBonfires\n\nBonfires are a central element of Midsummer celebrations. They symbolize the sun and its life-giving energy. Communities gather around these fires, enjoying their warmth and light. The bonfires often serve as focal points for social gatherings, providing a place for people to meet and celebrate together.\n\nWearing flower crowns is a beloved Midsummer tradition. People, especially children and young adults, make crowns from fresh flowers and greenery. These crowns represent the beauty and abundance of nature at its peak. They also add a colorful and festive touch to the celebrations.\n\nDancing is a key part of Midsummer festivities. Traditional dances, often performed around a decorated maypole, bring people together in joyous movement.\n\nFeasting is another important aspect, with families and friends sharing meals that include seasonal foods like new potatoes, pickled herring, and strawberries. The celebrations continue well into the night, taking advantage of the long daylight hours.\n\nEach year, thousands of people gather at Stonehenge to witness the sunrise on the summer solstice. This ancient stone circle in England is aligned with the solstice sunrise, making it a significant site for this event.\n\nFor many, the gathering at Stonehenge is a spiritual experience. The solstice sunrise, framed by the ancient stones, creates a profound sense of connection to the past and the rhythms of the earth. Participants often feel a deep sense of awe and reverence as they watch the sun rise over the horizon.\n\nStonehenge's alignment with the solstice has long fascinated people. The monument's construction, dating back thousands of years, shows a sophisticated understanding of astronomy by its builders. The solstice gatherings provide a tangible link to this ancient knowledge and the people who created Stonehenge.\n\nThe event at Stonehenge is not just about observing the sunrise; it's also a communal celebration. People from various backgrounds and beliefs come together to mark this special day. The atmosphere is one of unity and shared purpose, as everyone gathers to witness a moment that has been celebrated for millennia.\n\nMany cultures around the world celebrate the solstice with festivals of light. These celebrations symbolize the sun's power and the triumph of light over darkness.\n\nLighting bonfires is a common practice in solstice celebrations. These fires symbolize the strength and energy of the sun at its peak. They are often the center of communal gatherings, providing warmth and a focal point for festivities.\n\nSome cultures use fireworks to celebrate the solstice. The bright, colorful displays in the night sky highlight the theme of light and celebration. Fireworks create a festive and exhilarating atmosphere, adding excitement to the solstice events.\n\nLighting candles and lanterns is another way to honor the solstice. This practice is often more intimate and personal, allowing individuals and families to create their own small celebrations of light. Candles and lanterns can be used to decorate homes, gardens, and public spaces, creating a warm and welcoming glow.\n\nEvery year, thousands of people gather in New York City's Times Square to participate in a unique celebration of the summer solstice. This event, known as \"Solstice in Times Square: Mind Over Madness Yoga,\" transforms one of the busiest and most iconic places in the world into a serene yoga haven.\n\nThroughout the day, free yoga classes are offered to participants of all skill levels. These classes are led by well-known yoga instructors and are designed to accommodate everyone, from beginners to advanced practitioners.\n\nThe event typically features multiple yoga sessions, starting early in the morning and continuing until sunset. This allows people to join at a time that suits their schedule and experience the calming effects of yoga amidst the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nThe theme of \"Mind Over Madness Yoga\" revolves around celebrating the light within and around us. This aligns with the summer solstice's symbolism of light, growth, and renewal. Practicing yoga on the longest day of the year serves as a reminder to embrace inner peace and balance.\n\nWhile the summer solstice is a time of celebration, it's also a captivating display of our planet's celestial mechanics. The Earth doesn't spin upright like a top; it's tilted on its axis at approximately 23.5 degrees. This tilt, combined with Earth's year-long journey around the sun, is the driving force behind our changing seasons.\n\nDuring the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, this tilt positions us to receive the most direct sunlight, leading to longer days and warmer temperatures.\n\nHowever, Earth's orbit is a continuous cycle. As we move past the solstice, our planet's tilt gradually starts to shift the Northern Hemisphere away from the sun's direct rays.\n\nThis shift causes the days to gradually shorten and the nights to lengthen. The sun's path across the sky appears lower, and its energy becomes less intense, ushering in the cooler temperatures of autumn.\n\nThis progression eventually leads us to the autumn equinox, where day and night are of equal length, and ultimately to the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year.\n\nThe summer solstice significantly impacts the natural world. This period of extended daylight and warmer temperatures profoundly affects plant growth and animal behavior.\n\nDuring the summer solstice, the increased daylight hours provide plants with more light from the sun.\n\nSunlight is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. As a result, plants grow more vigorously during this time.\n\nHome gardens experience a burst of growth. Flowers bloom, vegetables ripen, and herbs thrive. The long days and warm temperatures create ideal conditions for plant development.\n\nFarmers benefit from the solstice as crops like corn, wheat, and soybeans grow quickly. This period is crucial for agricultural productivity, ensuring a bountiful harvest later in the year.\n\nForests also reach their peak during the solstice. Trees are full of leaves, creating dense canopies. This lush growth supports a variety of wildlife, providing food and shelter.\n\nAnimals respond to the solstice in various ways, adapting their behaviors to take advantage of the favorable conditions.\n\nWith the extended daylight, birds begin their morning songs earlier. This behavior, known as the \"dawn chorus,\" is most pronounced around the solstice. Birds sing to mark their territory and attract mates, taking advantage of the quiet early hours.\n\nMany animal species experience a peak in reproductive activity during the solstice. The abundance of food and mild weather create optimal breeding conditions.\n\nFor instance, deer often give birth to fawns around this time, ensuring their young have the best chance of survival.\n\nAnimals, such as squirrels and insects, increase their foraging activities. The plentiful food sources allow them to build up reserves for less abundant times.\n\nEven if you don't partake in traditional festivities, there are plenty of ways to embrace the summer solstice.\n\nTake advantage of the extra daylight to hike, bike, or simply enjoy a picnic in the park.

This day is celebrated as a festivity that marks the beginning of the warmer months, longer days, shorter nights, early dawns, and late sunsets in the Northern Hemisphere. From this day, the sun will not set at the north pole or rise at the south pole. The summer solstice, also known as estival solstice or midsummer, is celebrated by many cultures worldwide with numerous traditions, holidays and festivals. And there are many interesting things about the June solstice that you must know, making the longest day of the year even more fascinating. When is summer solstice 2024? What does solstice mean? Here, answer all your frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the midsummer.\n\nThe celebration of June Solstice is different in every country. This article will provide all your summer solstice FAQs answered.\n\nSummer Solstice will occur on June 20 at 4:50 PM EDT and in case of India, it will happen on June 21 at 2:20 AM IST.\n\nAccording to NASA, 'solstice' means 'sun stands still' in Latin. This phenomenon occurs because Earth rotates on its axis that is tilted by 23.5 degrees. During its annual orbit of the Sun, different parts of the Earth receive sunlight for different durations of time. The June Solstice this year will see the Northern Hemisphere tilted towards the sun to the maximum extent. The sun rises at the farthest northeast on the horizon, reaches its extreme northerly point in the sky at midday and sets in the farthest northwest. Thus, it remains in the sky for the longest period, resulting in more sunlight and warmer temperatures.\n\nDuring the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere will experience its shortest day of the year, or the one with the least duration of sunlight.\n\nUsually, Summer Solstice occurs on June 21 every year, but this is not the case for this season. This year's Solstice is particularly early. This is primarily due to the fact that 2024 is a leap year. Mostly during leap years, solstice and equinoxes occur about 18 hours and 11 minutes earlier than the previous year, according to the Washington Post. During the non-leap year, the timing of the solstice happens later, thus, the timings are adjusted.\n\nSeveral ancient celebrations are associated with June Solstice. People organise calendars and farmers sow or harvest crops on this auspicious day. In Sweden, people throw all kinds of parties during Summer Solstice. People dance around the maypole with flowers in their hair, eat smoked fish and take shots. In India, the solstice will collide with the Yoga Day and people will carry out mass yoga sessions.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midsummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "June solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth's rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maypole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maypole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leap year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Summer-Solstice-1-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 406, "textEnd": 413, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1288, "textEnd": 1295}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

This time of year often coincides with summer breaks, strawberries, and, of course, Stonehenge.\n\nThe word \"solstice\" comes from two Latin words: sol (sun) and sistere (to stand still) according to the Almanac.\n\nThe summer solstice takes place when the Tropic of Cancer is aligned directly with our sun. It's also the longest day of the year.\n\nAround the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is at its most extreme tilt away from the sun, entering the winter solstice and its shortest day of the year.\n\nAutumn and spring are marked by the autumnal equinox and vernal equinox, respectively, according to the National Weather Service's website.\n\nThe summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere typically falls on a different date every year and those range from June 20 to June 22.\n\nThe summer solstice is part of the astronomical seasons, which are based on the Earth's position relative to the sun.\n\nBut meteorological seasons are based on the temperatures that would be expected during each season.\n\nWhile the summer solstice begins on June 20 this year, according to the meteorological season, the first day of summer already started on June 1.\n\nMeteorological seasons are divided into three-month periods. Meteorological summer includes June, July and August.\n\nSplitting the seasons into these nearly equal three-month periods makes seasonal recordkeeping much easier since the start and end dates of the seasons are always the same.\n\nAdditionally, each meteorological season is always 90 to 92 days, depending on whether it's a leap year or not.\n\nThere are many traditions around the world to welcome the summer solstice.\n\nIn Sweden, it is customary to eat the first harvested strawberries of the season to celebrate the June solstice, according to the Almanac.\n\nOne of the more famous celebrations during the summer solstice is the gathering at Stonehenge.\n\nStonehenge was built on the flat lands of Salisbury Plain in stages starting 5,000 years ago, with the unique stone circle erected in the late Neolithic period about 2,500 B.C. Some of the stones, the so-called bluestones, are known to have come from the Preseli Hills in southwest Wales, nearly 150 miles (240 kilometers) away, but the origins of others remain a mystery.\n\nThe site's meaning has been the subject of vigorous debate, with some theories seemingly more outlandish, if not alien, than others.\n\nEnglish Heritage notes several explanations -- from Stonehenge being a coronation place for Danish kings, a druid temple, a cult center for healing, or an astronomical computer for predicting eclipses and solar events.\n\nThe charity said the most generally accepted interpretation \"is that of a prehistoric temple aligned with the movements of the sun.\"\n\nAfter all, the stones match perfectly with the sun at both the summer and winter solstices.\n\nThis year's summer solstice comes with a treat: the first full moon of the summer, coined the strawberry moon. The moon won't be pink or red in color: Its name comes from several Indigenous tribes who noticed that its timing coincided with the strawberry harvest.", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "March equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "September equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropic of Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strawberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leap year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bluestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Plain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salisbury Plain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_circle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stone circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Druid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1280/720/Summer-solstice-NYC.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "dateEnd": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 922, "textEnd": 940}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1301, "textEnd": 1307}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

It's all thanks to the summer solstice, a super cool astronomical event that marks the official start of summer in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nOn June 20 at 4:51 p.m. EDT, the sun hits its peak, giving us the most daylight hours of any day in the year. Orlando, for instance, is set to enjoy about 14 hours of sunlight that day.\n\nNow, the science behind this solar extravaganza is pretty neat. You see, the Earth isn't standing straight up as it orbits the sun. It's tilted at about 23.5 degrees. This tilt is what gives us our seasons. When the Northern Hemisphere leans closest to the sun, we get the summer solstice.\n\nIt's like Earth throwing a summer party for the North Pole, with the sun shining directly overhead.\n\n[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it's FREE) | PINIT!

It's that magical moment when the sun seems to pause before heading back on its journey across our sky.\n\nThe summer solstice isn't fixed to a specific date, but usually falls between June 20 and 22. It's nature's way of reminding us that our little blue planet is always on the move, dancing through the seasons as it orbits the sun.\n\nEmail AddressSign up now!\n\nGet today's headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily:", "source": {"uri": "clickorlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKMG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_morgan@clickorlando.com", "name": "Michelle Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zenith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/YI5AWIW76FDBZOIEFBPR3VIGAA.png?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "dateEnd": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1373, "textEnd": 1387}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 229, "textEnd": 236}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Source: Created with the help of AI\n\nFor centuries, people have been observing the sky and attaching special significance to certain features in the movement of celestial bodies. This is how the ancient holiday marking the summer solstice appeared.\n\nThis day symbolizes the top of the solar cycle. Read about its features and date in the OBOZ.UA article.\n\nWhen is the solstice in 2024?\n\nAs a rule, the summer solstice falls on June 21, but every 3-4 years it shifts to the 20th.\n\nThis will happen in 2024, as the Sun will pass through the northernmost point of the ecliptic at exactly 23:50:20 on June 20, Kyiv time.\n\nThe meaning of the summer solstice\n\nThe summer solstice is the day when the sun reaches its highest point above the horizon, giving us the longest day of the year. Since ancient times, this event has been associated with mysticism, magic, and folk rituals that were intended to preserve and increase the vitality of nature. In addition, people have been basing their calendars on the natural lunar and solar cycles for centuries.\n\nIn almost all cultures, the summer solstice was the day of the peak of the Sun's power. It was deified and considered a celebration of the beginning of summer, light, power, and invincibility of life. Even with the advent of monotheistic religions, the importance and significance of the solstice has remained.\n\nTraditions of the summer solstice\n\nThe summer solstice had a special significance for our ancestors back in the days of paganism. Back then, there were many unique rituals and beliefs.\n\nLater, with the advent of Christianity, the holiday of Ivan Kupala appeared in Ukraine, which was timed to coincide with the solstice. However, it is now tied to the church holiday of St. John the Baptist and has a fixed date.\n\nWhat to do on the solstice\n\nSince the summer solstice is considered a holiday, you should enjoy it and do things that bring you pleasure. In the old days, people used to organize festivities, jump over bonfires, collect medicinal herbs, weave wreaths, and perform special Midsummer songs and rituals.\n\nYou can also make a wish during the solstice. It is believed that it will definitely come true.\n\nProhibitions on the solstice\n\nDuring the holiday, you shouldn't swear, gossip, or say bad things about people. The solstice should be held in peace, tranquility, and harmony.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomical object"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecliptic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotheosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apotheosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mysticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupala_Night", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kupala Night"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midsummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bonfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Baptist", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John the Baptist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monotheism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/6/20/img3236.png?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 501, "textEnd": 508}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 671, "textEnd": 678}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

During the winter solstice in December, New Orleans experiences the shortest day of the year, with only about 10 hours of daylight. In contrast, Thursday's 14 hours of sunlight allow ample time to soak up the sun and enjoy the vibrant energy that summer brings.\n\nThe summer solstice is a special day because it's a turning point.

(WKBW) -- Summer here in Western New York and the Northern Hemisphere begins on June 20 with the arrival of the Summer Solstice.\n\nBut just exactly what IS the summer solstice, and what does that exactly mean?\n\nThroughout history, cultures have celebrated the summer solstice with festivals and traditions often associated with themes of growth, and renewal. Scientifically, the summer solstice marks the point in the year when the Earth's axis is tilted MOST toward the sun, resulting in the longest day and shortest night of the year. It also means that the days will gradually shorten going forward!\n\nIntuitively, we'd think that the distance of our big blue marble to the sun would govern how we warm up. But that's not the case! How the Earth is titled with respect to the sun is the main driver of our seasons. The distance to the sun has nothing to do with it. As summer gets going, we're 94.5 million miles away from the sun. In January, after the winter solstice, we're actually more than 3 million miles closer!\n\nYou may also be wondering why the warmest day on average doesn't match up with the summer solstice. This is because of something called the seasonal temperature lag. Water absorbs a large amount of energy before it actually gets warmer due to it having a higher specific heat than land does. In other words, it physically heats up slower than the land. Water has a major influence on regulating air temperatures around the globe. As a result, some of the lowest or highest temperatures of the year take place a month after either the winter or summer solstice, and not on their actual dates.\n\nSo as you can see the summer's warmth has nothing to do with our distance to the sun, as we're actually FURTHER away from the sun on the day of the summer solstice than we are in winter!

After this, the days gradually tend to become shorter. Here's all you need to know and what to expect on the day of the Summer Solstice this year, in 2024.\n\nSummer Solstice 2024: What's the date and time?\n\nEvery year, June 21 is marked as the day of the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere of the world. According to NASA, this year, the summer solstice globally will appear on June 20 at 4:50 p.m. EDT. However, in India, it will occur on June 21 at 8:09 p.m. IST.\n\nSummer Solstice 2024: The science behind it\n\nThe Earth rotates on its axis, causing the Northern Hemisphere to receive more direct sunlight between March and September. This means that people living in the Northern Hemisphere experience summer during this time because the Earth's axis is tilted at about 23.5 degrees, causing the North Pole to be tipped towards the sun while the South Pole is away from it.\n\nAs a result, when the North Pole points most directly towards the sun and reaches its highest point at solar noon for regions outside of the tropics, we experience the longest amount of daylight for the year. According to NASA, this occurs on June 20, 21, or 22, marking the summer solstice, which means \"sun stands still\" in Latin.\n\nSummer Solstice 2024: Know its origin and significance\n\nTracing the origin, it was around 200 BC when Eratosthenes, the ancient Greek scholar, conducted a groundbreaking experiment to measure the Earth's circumference. He observed that on the summer solstice, sunlight shone directly down a well in Aswan, Egypt, indicating the sun was directly overhead.\n\nFurther, while travelling north to Alexandria, he noted the shadows cast by obelisks were not vertical, suggesting the sun was not directly overhead. By calculating the difference in shadow lengths between the two cities and the distance between them, Eratosthenes was able to provide an early, remarkably accurate estimate of the Earth's circumference while also offering compelling evidence that the Earth is a sphere rather than flat.\n\nHence, the summer solstice marks the longest day of the year, when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky. Spiritually, the summer solstice represents a time of renewal, growth, and connection to the natural world. Many cultures view the summer solstice as the \"middle of summer,\" or a time of celebration and honouring the sun's life-giving power.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_night", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polar night"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axial tilt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth's rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_circumference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth's circumference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eratosthenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zenith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Greece"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aswan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aswan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/06/Summer-solstice-2022.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 588, "textEnd": 595, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 755, "textEnd": 762}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 1497, "textEnd": 1504}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It's the earliest start of the season in the past 228 years.\n\nWith the scorching temperatures across the U.S., it's already felt like summer for weeks. If you ask a meteorologist, it's been summer since June 1. However, the start of astronomical summer begins with the summer solstice.\n\nThis year, the summer solstice happens June 20 at 4:51 p.m. ET, when the Sun is directly above the Tropic of Cancer. It's also known as the longest day of the year because it has the most daylight.\n\nWhile the summer solstice can fall between June 20 and 22, it last occurred on June 20, 1796, when George Washington was president.\n\nThese dates can vary yearly since it takes the Earth 365 days and 6 hours to make one complete orbit of the Sun. That is why the Gregorian calendar adds a leap year every four years with 366 days. During leap years, solstices and equinoxes happen earlier than the previous year, moving up the summer solstice by about 45 minutes every four years.\n\nThe summer solstice will happen about 40-50 minutes earlier until the next century.\n\nSolstices would happen indefinitely earlier every four years except for another quirky rule of the Gregorian calendar to keep it in sync with Earth's orbit of the Sun.\n\nAny year divided by four is a leap year except years evenly divided by 100 (century years), which are only leap years when divisible by 400. This means 2100 will not be a leap year, according to Timeanddate.com. Skipping these leap years helps keep the calendar on time with Earth's dance around the Sun.\n\nMany cultures celebrate the summer solstice with festivals and bonfires. For some who practice yoga, it can involve the tradition of performing 108 sun salutations on summer and winter solstices to welcome the new season.\n\nAs a bonus, this year's summer solstice happens before a full Moon. June's Strawberry full Moon rises at 9:08 p.m. ET.

(Image credit: Richard Baker / In Pictures via Getty Images)\n\nSummer officially begins today (June 20) at 4:51 p.m. EDT (2051 GMT)\n\nSummer officially begins in the Northern Hemisphere today (June 20), marking the longest day of the year.\n\nDuring the summer solstice, also known as the June solstice, the sun reaches its highest and northernmost point in the sky. It marks the beginning of the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere, with the Northern Hemisphere receiving the most daylight hours of the year, and the Southern Hemisphere receiving the least.\n\nYou can calculate how many hours of daylight you'll receive during the June solstice using The Farmer's Almanac Sunrise and Sunset Calculator. Those located above the Arctic Circle will experience the longest day. There, the sun doesn't set below the horizon for several weeks or even months over the summer due to the phenomenon known as the midnight sun.\n\nThis year the summer solstice officially occurs at 4:51 p.m. EDT (2051 GMT,) it will be followed by a full Strawberry Moon one day later on June 21. The moon will reach its full phase at 9:08 p.m. EDT (or 01:08 GMT on Saturday, June 22), but will still appear full the night before and after its peak to the casual stargazer. It will shine near the stars of the constellation Sagittarius, the Archer.\n\nWe owe the June solstice, along with the seasons to Earth's tilt as it orbits the sun. Without it, both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres would receive equal light throughout the year.\n\nAs Earth orbits the sun, the axial tilt of 23.44\u00b0 causes one hemisphere to be tilted toward the sun for half of the year and the other for the second half. During the June solstice the Northern Hemisphere is most tilted towards the sun whereas the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away.\n\nThe solstices also do not occur on the same day every year because the astronomical year is 365.25 days long. As such, the summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere currently shifts between June 20, 21 and 22. The summer solstice does, however, occur at the same time for every country. This means the exact moment of summer solstice can occur in the middle of the night for some people and the middle of the day for others.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]", "source": {"uri": "brudirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BruneiDirect"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "June solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midnight sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arctic Circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axial tilt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth's orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sagittarius (constellation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Degree (angle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constellation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 65}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 297, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 1293, "textEnd": 1300}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1381, "textEnd": 1388}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 2223, "textEnd": 2230}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It has been celebrated in various traditions and festivals throughout history, often symbolising renewal, fertility, and the sun's power.\n\nThe day is especially important for druids or pagans. They gather at Stonehenge, the prehistoric monument on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, to celebrate it each year.\n\nThe winter solstice marks the first day of winter and is the shortest day and longest night of the year.\n\nOn this day, the Earth's tilt brings the Northern or the Southern Hemispheres to their farthest point from the sun.\n\nThis year, the winter solstice will fall in the UK on Friday, (December 21) at 9.19am.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the winter solstice normally occurs on or around June 22. This year, it is on June 21.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algarve", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algarve"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Algarve"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midsummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Plain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salisbury Plain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Druid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prehistory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wiltshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wiltshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/e7639c2b356391ec69da6d297fccf29b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "dateEnd": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 954, "textEnd": 973}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 260, "textEnd": 267}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 718, "textEnd": 725}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 854, "textEnd": 861, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-21", "textStart": 1056, "textEnd": 1067, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1868, "textEnd": 1875}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

What better time to get out and enjoy some rays than on the longest day of the year: the summer solstice.\n\nThis day in June, which marks the astronomical start of summer, is an important part of history with many traditions tied to it in various cultures. Let's get into everything you need to know about the summer solstice in the Netherlands.\n\nOccurring when the North Pole's tilt towards the sun is at its greatest, the June solstice marks the longest day of the year for the northern hemisphere and is therefore also called the summer solstice in this part of the world. At the same time on the other side of the world, the southern hemisphere experiences its shortest day of the year, known as the winter solstice.\n\nThe summer solstice is also known as midsummer in some countries, especially those in Europe, and is often seen as the middle of summer. The summer solstice for 2024 in the Netherlands takes place on June 20 at 10.50pm, bringing the longest day of the year at almost 17 hours.\n\nThere is evidence that the summer solstice has been observed since the Stone Age in many parts of the world, such as Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Americas. Arguably one of the best-known neolithic monuments that aligns with the movements of the sun is Stonehenge in the UK, where the sun shines into the centre of the stone circle during the summer solstice.\n\nArchaeologists discovered a 4.000-year-old solar calendar in Tiel in the Netherlands as recently as 2023. Surrounding a burial mound is a ditch with several passages through which the sun shines on important astronomical days such as the summer and winter solstices. The fact that shrines and a solar observatory are found in one location indicates that this area was most likely used for important rituals and traditions.\n\nAncient monuments such as these show that the movements of the sun played an important role in early cultures around the world. In some parts of Northern Europe, the date is still celebrated with the lighting of bonfires and other festivities. In Sweden, Midsummer celebrations are an integral part of traditions and include dancing around a maypole, singing, drinking and sharing a feast with friends and family.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the longest day of the year is not as culturally significant as it is in other countries, which means that there aren't any specific Dutch traditions to observe on the day. However, if you still want to attend a summer solstice celebration in the Netherlands, you can find plenty events and festivals with summer vibes that take place around the time of the June solstice.\n\nDance under the sun and celebrate the summer solstice at the Ruigoord Solstice Festival in Amsterdam. With an exhibition, chill-out areas and multiple stages where psychedelic trance music with a modern twist is played, this solstice celebration is a great way to experience the old tribal midsummer night rituals.\n\nVideo: YouTube / Simeon in 't Veld\n\nMidzomernacht celebrates the longest day of the year and the shortest night of the year, and kicks off the summer, all in one huge party with an evening full of performances, a fire ceremony that gives a nod to old traditions and a fully-fledged club night. If you go to this midsummer festival hosted by a restaurant in Amsterdam, you'll be making the most of the extra hours of sunshine, as it continues well into the morning.\n\nNot just one day, but a whole week of revelry, the Summer Solstice Island Gathering offers a safe space to enjoy the celebrations around the longest day of the year on an island off the shore of Harderwijk in Flevoland. Just 90 minutes away from Amsterdam by public transport, you can camp in nature, swim in the lake and meet new people in a unique gathering.\n\nWhat says summer more than thousands of flowers on boats floating through Dutch canals? The Floating Flower Parade travels through various Dutch cities and is quite the spectacle with more than 50 boats decorated with a colourful array of blooms, fruits and vegetables. Add music and performers, and you have yourself the perfect event to celebrate summer!\n\nImage credit: SkandaRamana / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaking place each year in Scheveningen, Flag Day (Vlaggetjesdag) is one of the biggest events in The Hague. This Dutch tradition celebrates the first herring catch of the year with marching bands, games, markets and an auction. You'll also be able to grab some herring for yourself, so if you're looking for a Dutch way to enjoy the summer, why not try this event dedicated to the Dutch snack?\n\nThe longest day of the year is here and with it, we'll hopefully have plenty of sunny weather and beach days to follow. Whether you celebrate or not, happy summer solstice!", "source": {"uri": "iamexpat.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "IamExpat"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It marks the beginning of the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere, with the Northern Hemisphere receiving the most daylight hours of the year, and the Southern Hemisphere receiving the least.\n\nYou can calculate how many hours of daylight you'll receive during the June solstice using The Farmer's Almanac Sunrise and Sunset Calculator. Those located above the Arctic Circle will experience the longest day. There, the sun doesn't set below the horizon for several weeks or even months over the summer due to the phenomenon known as the midnight sun.\n\nRelated: The sun's magnetic field is about to flip. Here's what to expect.\n\nThis year the summer solstice officially occurs at 4:51 p.m. EDT (2051 GMT,) it will be followed by a full Strawberry Moon one day later on June 21. The moon will reach its full phase at 9:08 p.m. EDT (or 01:08 GMT on Saturday, June 22), but will still appear full the night before and after its peak to the casual stargazer. It will shine near the stars of the constellation Sagittarius, the Archer.\n\nWe owe the June solstice, along with the seasons to Earth's tilt as it orbits the sun. Without it, both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres would receive equal light throughout the year.\n\nAs Earth orbits the sun, the axial tilt of 23.44\u00b0 causes one hemisphere to be tilted toward the sun for half of the year and the other for the second half. During the June solstice the Northern Hemisphere is most tilted towards the sun whereas the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away.\n\nThe solstices also do not occur on the same day every year because the astronomical year is 365.25 days long. As such, the summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere currently shifts between June 20, 21 and 22. The summer solstice does, however, occur at the same time for every country.

(FOX Carolina) - The summer solstice is here marking the official start to astronomical summer.\n\nThe summer solstice happens when the earth's tilt away from the sun is at it's furthest point putting the sun at it's highest point in the sky over the Northern Hemisphere. The sun sits directly over the Tropic of Cancer, the furthest north the sun goes.\n\nThis year, the summer solstice is the earliest it's been in 228 years. The solstice happens at 4:51 PM on June 20th. The last time it was earlier than this was in 1796 when George Washington was president and there were only 16 states in the United States.\n\nSo why does the date and time of the solstice fluctuate so much? It all comes down to the Gregorian calendar, which is the one we all currently use, and how it doesn't exactly line up with the earth's orbit around the sun.\n\nIt takes the earth 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 45 seconds to orbit the sun. Because of the extra time, we have a leap year every four years to compensate. But then every four centuries, we skip three leap days in order to offset the missing 1 minute and 15 second. In 2100, the leap year is skipped.\n\nDuring leap years, the solstices and the equinoxes happen 18 hours earlier than the previous year and 45 minutes earlier than the previous leap year.

(AP File)\n\nIt's time for the start of summer -- with a full moon to boot.\n\nHere's what to know about the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere on Thursday.\n\nThe Earth spins on a tilt as it revolves around the sun. The summer solstice occurs for Earth's upper half when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted most closely toward the sun. This also marks the longest day and shortest night of the year.\n\nAround the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is at its most extreme tilt away from the sun, entering winter solstice and its shortest day of the year.\n\nSix months later, the halves will switch it up: The Northern Hemisphere will experience a winter solstice, and the Southern Hemisphere will have a summer solstice.\n\nRelated Story: Brace Yourselves. Triple-Digit Heat Is Heading Back Here.\n\nEquinoxes mark the start of spring and autumn, and happen when Earth's axis and orbit line up such that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.\n\nThe vernal equinox on March 19 kicked off spring, and the autumnal equinox on Sept. 22 will usher in fall.\n\nThis year's summer solstice comes with a treat: the first full moon of the summer, coined the strawberry moon. The moon won't be pink or red in color: Its name comes from several Indigenous tribes who noticed that its timing coincided with the strawberry harvest.\n\nOn Friday evening, cast your eyes to the southeast to glimpse the full moon peeking above the horizon.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_circle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stone circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "March equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "September equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axial tilt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Anomalous_Objects", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Anomalous Objects", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://gvwire.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20074958/Revelers-gather-at-the-ancient-stone-circle-Stonehenge-to-celebrate-the-summer-solstice_1280X720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-19", "textStart": 1237, "textEnd": 1245}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-22", "textStart": 1293, "textEnd": 1301}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 251, "textEnd": 258}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

But why? And why do the days change in length throughout the year to begin with?\n\n\"Solstice\" means \"sun stands still\" in Latin. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice is the day when the sun rises and sets at its most northeasterly and northwesterly points in the year. The phenomenon is caused by Earth's 23.5 degrees of axial tilt with respect to the sun; so as our planet orbits our star, one hemisphere leans away from the sun and the other towards it.\n\nThis means that the solstice is the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere -- the June solstice is the shortest day of the year and marks the winter solstice in the south.\n\nToday's solstice is the earliest since 1796, the year in which George Washington issued his farewell address. But this variation is caused by humans and boils down to the Gregorian calendar.\n\nRelated: The 1st 'major lunar standstill' in more than 18 years is about to occur. Here's how to see it.\n\nThe calendar divides one year into 365 days. However, Earth's actual full orbital time around the sun is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 45 seconds -- which we account for by adding a leap year every four years to round the calendar up. But this creates its own problem: four times 5 hours, 48 minutes and 45 seconds is 23 hours and 15 minutes, meaning it's 45 minutes short of a full day.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nTo account for this drift, the calendar is \"reset\" by skipping a leap day every four centuries, with the next reset due in 2100. But until then, during leap years like this year, the solstice will occur 18 hours earlier than the previous year and 45 minutes earlier than the previous leap year.\n\nSo every successive leap year from now until the end of the millennium will be the earliest since 1796 by 45 minutes.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n-- How does the summer solstice affect animals?\n\n-- 10 temples, tombs and monuments that align with the summer solstice\n\n-- Strawberry Moon 2024: See summer's first full moon rise a day after solstice\n\nOne day after the solstice this year, on June 21, skywatchers will be treated to a beautiful Strawberry Moon -- the lowest full moon of the year.\n\nThe origins of Earth's tilt can be traced back more than 4 billion years to when Earth was first forming. During its formation, our planet suffered an estimated 10 gigantic collisions with other planets.\n\nIn the last of these, a Mars-size planet called Theia hit our planet with such force that it transformed Earth's surface into a molten hellscape and ejected rocks and dust into space, which later became our moon. The colossal impact also gave our planet its tilt.

The peak will be at 1:50 p.m.\n\nIn most years, June 21 is the longest day of the year, but the timing varies a bit each year because of the Earth's rotation.

The result is that, with the exception of the polar regions, the Northern Hemisphere experiences the longest period of daylight hours of the year on that day, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nBut, of course, the polar regions have days that are far longer when the Earth tilts toward the sun.\n\nThe summer sun never sets above the Arctic Circle.

It's a moment etched in time, the longest day of the year in one hemisphere and the shortest in the other, a pivot point where seasons embrace and transform.\n\nWhat Causes The Sun's North-South Movement?: The Sun's north-south movement relative to Earth is due to our planet's axial tilt. This tilt means that Earth's axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees from vertical. As Earth revolves around the Sun, the direct sunlight shifts between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, causing the seasons. The hemisphere tilted towards the Sun experiences summer, while the other hemisphere experiences winter.\n\nHistory of Observing Summer Solstice: In approximately 200 BC, Eratosthenes is said to have observed sunlight shining straight down the shaft of a well during high noon on the solstice, near the modern-day Egyptian city of Aswan.\n\nOn June 21st, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The rays of the sun fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer.\n\nAs a consequence, those areas receive extra heat. The areas near the poles get less heat (as the rays of the sun are slanting). The North Pole is inclined towards the sun & the places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for almost 6 months.\n\nAs a large area of the Northern Hemisphere is receiving light from the sun, it is summer in the regions north of the equator. The longest day & the shortest night at these places occur on 21st June.\n\nThe Summer Solstice happens when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted closest to the Sun. This occurs around June 21st each year. On this day, the sun's rays hit the Northern Hemisphere more directly than any other time of the year. Because of this, the Sun appears at its highest point in the sky. This leads to the longest day and the shortest night of the year. In India, this means we have more daylight hours than any other day of the year.\n\nWhen Will Summer Solstice Happen in India?: As per NASA, the official date is June 20 at 4:50 PM EDT. But in the case of India, it will happen on June 21.\n\nPlaces On Earth Where The Sun Never Sets!: Our routine revolves around 24 hours a day, with around 12 hours of sunlight, and the remaining hours are night time. But, did you know that there are places across the world where the sun does not go down for more than 70 days? Imagine how interesting (or confusing) it would be for tourists to keep a track of time, when even the locals there get confused with no sunset for straight 70 days! .\n\nWhy Doesn't The Sun Set in Some Parts of The World?: Around the time of the summer solstice, areas of norway, finland, greenland, alaska and other polar regions experience midnight sun - or 24-hours of sunlight.\n\nIn the Arctic Circle, the Sun does not set at all. This is because of the tilt in the Earth's axis.\n\nThe Earth's Distance From The Sun: NASA says that the Earth's distance from the sun is typically 93 million miles (150 million km). According to Almanac.com, Earth will be the furthest from the sun on 6 July 2023, at 4:06 pm EDT (1:36\u202fam IST), when it will be 94,506,364 miles (152,093,251 kilometres) away. This is known as the aphelion. This is roughly two weeks following the June solstice.\n\nSimilar to this, according to LiveScience, Earth will reach its perihelion, or closest point to the sun, on 2 January 2024, at 7:38\u202fpm EDT (5:08\u202fam IST), two weeks after the December solstice. At this time, Earth will be 91,404,095 miles (147,100,632 km) from our star.\n\nHere is How Different Countries Celebrate The Summer Solstice:\n\nIndia (Mass Yoga Sessions): In India, people come together for mass yoga sessions at dawn to greet the solstice sun. It's a tradition that comes from the belief that it was on summer solstice that Adiyogi (the first yogi) met his disciples, who would help him bring the practice of yoga to different parts of the world. The mass yoga events on summer solstice, some of which are attended by more than 100,000 people, take place in cities across the country.\n\nEngland (Stonehenge): Each year, thousands gather at England's famous Stonehenge to watch the sunrise. Stonehenge is an intriguing pre-historic stone circle, which has puzzled archeologists and historians for centuries. On the summer solstice, the stone circle is precisely aligned with the rising and setting sun. It's believed that solstices have been celebrated here for thousands of years. In fact, the celebration of the summer solstice may have been the very reason why Stonehenge was built.\n\nRussia (White Night): Known as White Night in Russia, the festival is celebrated with pomp and splendour. Firework displays are on show, along with musical concerts and a Scarlet Sails event, in which huge ships sail across the Neva River with bright red sails.\n\nNorway (Slinningsb\u00e5let): In Norway, the festival is celebrated as Slinningsb\u00e5let, where bonfires are lit to honour the birth of John the Baptist. These fires are said to cleanse the air of evil spirits.\n\nSweden (Midsommar): In Sweden, the summer solstice or \"midsommar\", as the Swedes sayis a widely celebrated national holiday. With summery songs, crowns of flowers, breezy white dresses and flowery maypoles to dance around, Sweden's traditional midsummer festivals seem to come straight from a fairytale.", "source": {"uri":

The summer solstice is actually not on the same day every year because it isn't based on a specific calendar date or time. It depends on when the sun reaches the northernmost point from the equator, which can occur anywhere between June 20-22.\n\nAnd why does the solstice matter in regards to daylight?\n\nWell, it's because days begin to shorten following the summer solstice.\n\nDays shortening for SC\n\nThe summer solstice is the longest day of the year. According to Time and Date, South Carolina will have more than 14 hours and 25 minutes of daylight on Thursday.\n\nEvery day afterward will continue to progressively shorten. That means less sunlight each day for outdoor activities.\n\nThe days will slowly get shorter during the summer at daily intervals through the fall season, Time and Date states.\n\nA chart by Time and Date shows that sunset times gradually decrease each day in minutes.

Here are some intriguing astronomical facts about this event:\n\nAxial tilt and solar position: The summer solstice happens because of the Earth's axial tilt of about 23.5 degrees. During the solstice, the North Pole is tilted closest to the Sun, and the Sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer at latitude 23.5\u00b0N.\n\nLongest daylight hours: On the summer solstice, the Northern Hemisphere experiences the most prolonged period of daylight. The exact duration of daylight varies depending on the latitude. For example, at the Arctic Circle, there is 24 hours of continuous daylight.\n\nSolstitial points: The solstices (both summer and winter) mark the points where the Sun's path in the sky reaches its northernmost or southernmost point. After the summer solstice, the Sun starts to move southward in the sky.\n\nHistorical significance: Many ancient cultures built monuments to align with the solstices. For example, Stonehenge in England and the pyramids of Egypt are aligned with the sunrise on the summer solstice.\n\nChanging sunrise and sunset times: While the summer solstice has the longest day, it does not have the earliest sunrise or the latest sunset. These occur several days before and after the solstice due to the Earth's elliptical orbit and axial tilt.\n\nEquinox vs solstice: Unlike equinoxes, when day and night are approximately equal, solstices result in the maximum difference in daylight hours between summer and winter.\n\nCultural celebrations: The solstice has inspired festivals and rituals in various cultures, celebrating fertility, growth, and the peak of summer. Examples include Midsummer in Scandinavia and the Inti Raymi festival of the Incas.\n\nSouthern hemisphere: In the Southern Hemisphere, the summer solstice occurs around December 21-22, when the South Pole is tilted towards the Sun, marking the longest day there.\n\nThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Sunrise will be at 5:11 a.m. and sunset at 9:11 p.m.\n\nThe summer solstice is also the beginning of astronomical summer, more commonly called the start of the summer. After June 20, days will gradually get shorter heading to the autumn equinox in late September.\n\nThroughout human history, many have observed the summer solstice with celebrations and rituals. For instance, ancient Greeks marked the solstice as the start of the New Year and started the one-month countdown to the opening of the Olympic Games, true to this day.\n\nAncient European pagans welcomed the solstice with bonfires amid hopes of a good fall harvest. Bonfires were also associated with magic, banishing evil spirits and often led maidens to future husbands.\n\nStonehenge in the south of England is aligned with the direction of sunrise on the summer solstice - one of many theories about the purpose of this megalith monument where thousands gather each year to commemorate the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nMany Native Americans participated in solstice rituals still practiced today. For example, The Sioux perform a ceremonial Sundance while wearing symbolic colors.\n\nMany still celebrate the summer solstice. Parades and festivals are the most common. In Northern Europe, bonfires are lit and homes are decorated with garlands. In parts of Scandinavia, people dance around Maypoles.\n\nSeattle has one of the more free-spirited summer solstice parades in the country - the Fremont Solstice Parade. The 33rd annual parade is this Saturday, June 22, starting at 1 p.m. More than 60 community-based ensembles are expected to be part of the parade starting from 3rd and Leary Way and finishing on North 35th Avenue near the Seattle Art Cars. In addition to the parade, two music stages of live local bands will be a part of the festivities, along with many booths with handmade goods and art, fair food and more.\n\nThe weather expected for Saturday's parade will offer plenty of warm sunshine with high temperatures cracking the 80-degree mark. Sunscreen and other sun protective wear will be needed including wide-brimmed hats.\n\nOn Thursday's summer solstice, all can celebrate the start of summer with the summer weather outlook offering a good chance of warmer and drier conditions into September - something many can also celebrate following a cool damp Father's Day weekend.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Northwest"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ted_buehner@mynorthwest.com", "name": "Ted Buehner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bonfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "September equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Greece"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megalith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sioux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Solstice_Parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fremont Solstice Parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maypole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maypole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parade"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Employment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/summer-solstice.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 33, "textEnd": 40, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1678, "textEnd": 1685}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Occurring between June 20 and June 22 in the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice heralds the longest day and the shortest night of the year. This celestial event has deep astronomical significance and is intertwined with various cultural traditions and celebrations. According to Time Magazine, summer solstice 2024 this year will begin at 4.51 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) or 2.21 am Indian Standard Time (IST).\n\nThe longest day of the year\n\nOn the solstice, the Northern Hemisphere experiences the maximum duration of daylight. For example, places like Norway, often called the \"Land of the Midnight Sun\", enjoy almost 24 hours of sunlight.\n\nFinland, Greenland, Alaska and other polar regions also experience midnight Sun.\n\nHowever, it is the shortest day of the year in the Southern Hemisphere because of the Earth's tilt.\n\nHow is Earth's tilt connected to Summer Solstice?\n\nOur planet is tilted on its axis at approximately 23.5 degrees, which causes the amount of sunlight that reaches different areas of the Earth to change.\n\nThe summer solstice happens when the Earth's axial tilt is most inclined towards the Sun, resulting in the Sun reaching its highest position in the sky. On this day, rays hit the Tropic of Cancer directly at noon.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nPost-solstice, the days start to shorten gradually, as the Earth continues its orbit around the Sun.\n\nFirst day of summer\n\nThe June solstice is famous because it marks the astronomical first day of summer in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nOn the day of the June solstice, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight at the most direct angle of the year.\n\nSummer solstice coinciding with record heat\n\nMany parts of the world are experiencing record temperature.

It's a moment etched in time, the longest day of the year in one hemisphere and the shortest in the other, a pivot point where seasons embrace and transform.\n\nWhat Causes The Sun's North-South Movement?: The Sun's north-south movement relative to Earth is due to our planet's axial tilt. This tilt means that Earth's axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees from vertical. As Earth revolves around the Sun, the direct sunlight shifts between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, causing the seasons. The hemisphere tilted towards the Sun experiences summer, while the other hemisphere experiences winter.\n\nHistory of Observing Summer Solstice: In approximately 200 BC, Eratosthenes is said to have observed sunlight shining straight down the shaft of a well during high noon on the solstice, near the modern-day Egyptian city of Aswan.\n\nOn June 21st, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The rays of the sun fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer.\n\nAs a consequence, those areas receive extra heat. The areas near the poles get less heat (as the rays of the sun are slanting). The North Pole is inclined towards the sun & the places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for almost 6 months.\n\nAs a large area of the Northern Hemisphere is receiving light from the sun, it is summer in the regions north of the equator. The longest day & the shortest night at these places occur on 21st June.\n\nThe Summer Solstice happens when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted closest to the Sun. This occurs around June 21st each year. On this day, the sun's rays hit the Northern Hemisphere more directly than any other time of the year. Because of this, the Sun appears at its highest point in the sky. This leads to the longest day and the shortest night of the year. In India, this means we have more daylight hours than any other day of the year.\n\nWhen Will Summer Solstice Happen in India?: As per NASA, the official date is June 20 at 4:50 PM EDT. But in the case of India, it will happen on June 21.\n\nPlaces On Earth Where The Sun Never Sets!: Our routine revolves around 24 hours a day, with around 12 hours of sunlight, and the remaining hours are night time. But, did you know that there are places across the world where the sun does not go down for more than 70 days? Imagine how interesting (or confusing) it would be for tourists to keep a track of time, when even the locals there get confused with no sunset for straight 70 days! .\n\nWhy Doesn't The Sun Set in Some Parts of The World?: Around the time of the summer solstice, areas of norway, finland, greenland, alaska and other polar regions experience midnight sun - or 24-hours of sunlight.\n\nIn the Arctic Circle, the Sun does not set at all. This is because of the tilt in the Earth's axis.\n\nThe Earth's Distance From The Sun: NASA says that the Earth's distance from the sun is typically 93 million miles (150 million km). According to Almanac.com, Earth will be the furthest from the sun on 6 July 2023, at 4:06 pm EDT (1:36\u202fam IST), when it will be 94,506,364 miles (152,093,251 kilometres) away. This is known as the aphelion. This is roughly two weeks following the June solstice.\n\nSimilar to this, according to LiveScience, Earth will reach its perihelion, or closest point to the sun, on 2 January 2024, at 7:38\u202fpm EDT (5:08\u202fam IST), two weeks after the December solstice. At this time, Earth will be 91,404,095 miles (147,100,632 km) from our star.\n\nHere is How Different Countries Celebrate The Summer Solstice:\n\nIndia (Mass Yoga Sessions): In India, people come together for mass yoga sessions at dawn to greet the solstice sun. It's a tradition that comes from the belief that it was on summer solstice that Adiyogi (the first yogi) met his disciples, who would help him bring the practice of yoga to different parts of the world. The mass yoga events on summer solstice, some of which are attended by more than 100,000 people, take place in cities across the country.\n\nEngland (Stonehenge): Each year, thousands gather at England's famous Stonehenge to watch the sunrise. Stonehenge is an intriguing pre-historic stone circle, which has puzzled archeologists and historians for centuries. On the summer solstice, the stone circle is precisely aligned with the rising and setting sun. It's believed that solstices have been celebrated here for thousands of years. In fact, the celebration of the summer solstice may have been the very reason why Stonehenge was built.\n\nRussia (White Night): Known as White Night in Russia, the festival is celebrated with pomp and splendour. Firework displays are on show, along with musical concerts and a Scarlet Sails event, in which huge ships sail across the Neva River with bright red sails.\n\nNorway (Slinningsb\u00e5let): In Norway, the festival is celebrated as Slinningsb\u00e5let, where bonfires are lit to honour the birth of John the Baptist. These fires are said to cleanse the air of evil spirits.\n\nSweden (Midsommar): In Sweden, the summer solstice or \"midsommar\", as the Swedes sayis a widely celebrated national holiday. With summery songs, crowns of flowers, breezy white dresses and flowery maypoles to dance around, Sweden's traditional midsummer festivals seem to come straight from a fairytale.", "source": {"uri":

We have good news today", "body": "New Zealand's solstice will occur at 8.51am on Friday June 21, and Kiwis will experience the shortest day of the year. Image / NZME\n\nOn June 21, New Zealand will celebrate the winter solstice. But what does this mean, for the weather, the daylight hours or our spiritual selves? Sarah Pollok answers all your solstice questions.\n\nIf you're feeling a little more downcast or exhausted than usual, struggling to socialise or exercise, you may have been hit by a touch of Seasonal Affective Disorder, or just general winter blues from the cold weather and long nights.\n\nThe good news? June 21 is the Winter Solstice (the shortest day of the year) in the Southern Hemisphere, meaning daylight hours will begin to lengthen back out.\n\nJust as the seasons are reversed between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, so are the summer and winter solstices.\n\nIn New Zealand, the 2024 winter solstice happens on June 21, while the Northern Hemisphere experiences the summer solstice.\n\nThe winter solstice is an astronomical event that marks the day when the Southern Hemisphere is tilted farthest from the sun. This results in the least sunlight, making it the shortest day and longest night of the year.\n\nThe exact date will change each year by a few days.\n\nFor the more detail-orientated, the solstice will occur at 8.51am on Friday according to the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand.\n\nAfter this, the earth will continue orbiting around the sun but begin tilting back towards it.\n\nWhile days will lengthen from today, this doesn't mean warmer weather; the solstice also marks the start of winter - although some people, including meteorologists, consider June 1 the season's start - which will last until the Spring Equinox in late September.\n\nFor those of us with an interest in the spiritual and otherworldly, the day holds significance for reasons far beyond longer days.\n\nMany cultures and religions throughout history have attached mythical and spiritual significance to the winter solstice, which is commonly seen as a metaphor for the battle between darkness and light.\n\nIn ancient Rome, Saturnalia was a multi-day festival held over winter solstice that celebrated the return of the god Saturn. As those who see divinity in nature, Pagan traditions have also long acknowledged the shortest day of the year with 'Yule', which typically involves groups gathering to light candles, call forth spirits, perform readings and celebrate the coming sun with a fire of some kind and dancing.\n\nHowever, this metaphorical interpretation of the solstice isn't a thing of the past; today people continue to believe the winter solstice has a certain energy that can be harnessed for personal, spiritual practices.\n\nAstrologically, the winter solstice is the start of Capricorn season, an Earth sign ruled by Saturn. According to astrologists, this season is the perfect time to set aside abstract dreams and get serious about pursuing specific, achievable goals.\n\nIt's this interpretation that some people continue to subscribe to and rituals can include journaling intentions for the year, making bonfires, gathering with the community to celebrate the returning sunlight or meditation practices.\n\nCelebrating winter solstice often involves celebrating the start of winter or celebrating the slow return of the sun. Here are four ways you can celebrate either with friends or family this year.\n\n1. Host a Bonfire or Candlelight Gathering\n\nLight is a big part of winter solstice celebrations throughout time and around the world. Gather friends and family for an outdoor brazier get-together, or perhaps a cosy candlelit evening indoors, complete with hot drinks, good chat and lots of warm layers.\n\n2. Enjoy a Solstice Feast\n\nWhat better way to celebrate a season than by eating some of the star produce? From beetroot to Brussels sprouts, pumpkin or mushroom, a hearty dinner is the perfect way to get through the longest night of the year.\n\n3. Take a Nature Walk\n\nWhile the cool temperatures and darkness can be an invitation to bunker inside, why not flip the script and get outdoors for a dose of nature? Whether it's a stroll around the park during an office lunch break or a quick run before the sun sets in the evening, getting outside in the bracing air can do wonders for your body and mind.\n\n4. Practice Reflection and Goal Setting\n\nWhy not follow the astrological fans and spend the evening getting a little introspective? Grab a journal (or your notes app), and take the time to reflect on the past year and set some intentions for the year ahead. If you're feeling social, invite a bunch of friends around, collect some magazines and spend an evening making collage vision boards to share for a little accountability.\n\nAs mentioned, the winter solstice is also the shortest day in New Zealand and typically falls on or around June 21. On this day, cities such as Wellington get around nine hours of daylight.\n\nMatariki and the Winter Solstice do occur around the same time and are related to astronomy but are two distinct events.\n\nWhile the solstice is an astrological event related to the sun, Matariki is the M\u0101ori name for a large cluster of stars that appears in the pre-dawn sky in late June or early July.\n\nFully named \"Ng\u0101 Mata o te Ariki T\u0101whirim\u0101tea\" (\"The eyes of the god T\u0101whirim\u0101tea\"), the stars are significant as they mark the beginning of the M\u0101ori New Year; a cultural celebration of remembrance, celebration and preparation for the new year.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_pollok@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "Sarah Pollok", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Astronomical_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Astronomical Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astrology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "March equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saturnalia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_(astrology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capricorn (astrology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bonfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Winter", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Winter", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Winter_Sports/Snowshoeing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Winter Sports/Snowshoeing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/JLUIEXJVXNB65K3C56NZJHC4RU.jpg?auth=a0be1b96064797ee18916313d44ff25d97a5164b40f51dbdcc8be72dd5a169dc&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&focal=1469%2C692&smart=false", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 54, "textEnd": 61, "freq": 5}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1656, "textEnd": 1662}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Malcolm Denmark/FloridaToday/USA Today Network hide caption\n\nSummer officially arrives in the Northern Hemisphere on Thursday, the earliest start to the season in over two centuries.\n\nThe summer solstice -- the exact moment when Earth's north pole is most tilted towards the sun -- happens at 4:51 p.m. ET, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe phenomenon marks the longest day of the year (though the exact number of daylight hours varies by location) and the beginning of astronomical summer. Meteorological summer, in contrast, officially started on June 1 -- the reason why millions of Americans were already under extreme heat advisories in the hours leading up to the solstice.\n\nThe timing of the summer solstice naturally fluctuates between June 20 and 22. But it's an especially big deal this year, as it hasn't happened this early since 1796.\n\nThat summer solstice happened on June 20 at 1:24 p.m. \"Local Mean Time,\" according to The Weather Network. It says LMT -- used before the U.S. introduced standard time in the late 19th century -- is close enough to ET that the comparison is valid.\n\nAt that point, George Washington was president of the U.S., which Tennessee had just joined as the 16th state.\n\nWhat explains the solstice's extra-prompt arrival, these 228 years later?\n\nThe shortest answer is quirks in the calendar.\n\nA typical year has 365 days, but that's not exactly how long the Earth takes to orbit the sun -- it's more like 365.24. To account for that extra quarter, the Gregorian calendar adds a day to February every four years: leap day.\n\nThe way the math works, solstices (and equinoxes) drift about 45 minutes earlier every four years. By the 2060s, leap year solstices will be earlier than anything in the 1700s, astrophysicist Ethan Siegel writes in Big Think.\n\nThat pattern is due to continue until 2096, which will see the earliest solstice of the century at 2:32 a.m. ET on June 20.\n\n\"It will be the only summer solstice that people in the Pacific time zone of the Americas will experience on June 19 for several hundreds of years!\" Seigel adds.\n\nThen, the calendar will reset. That's because 2100 won't be a leap year, since it's one of those fun Gregorian exceptions that are divisible by 100 but not 400.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_treisman@npr.org", "name": "Rachel Treisman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_mean_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local mean time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standard time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leap year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars_and_Timekeeping", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars and Timekeeping", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5228x2941+0+178/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F6d%2Fe7160a26435ea6dc97dbb4e92228%2F2024-06-20t111424z-1554720808-mt1usatoday23584546-rtrmadp-3-it-was-not-your-calm-meditative-sunrise-for-the-summer.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "dateEnd": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 884, "textEnd": 898}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 689, "textEnd": 695}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1022, "textEnd": 1029, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 2164, "textEnd": 2171}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

shortest day of the year in the Southern Hemisphere (the winter solstice) is TODAY - here's the lowdown.\n\nDid you know that the shortest day of the year in the Southern Hemisphere (the winter solstice) is TODAY?\n\nAccording to Vox Weather forecaster Annette Bota, the winter solstice in South Africa takes place today.\n\n\"In simple terms, you might hear it referred to as the shortest day of the year.\n\n\"When people say \"the shortest day of the year\", they're not actually talking about the length of the day -- because each day is pretty much 24 hours long -- but the amount of time the Sun is visible above the horizon.\n\n\"We could be a bit more precise and say it is the day with the least number of daylight hours.\"\n\nShe explained that this happens because the Earth tilts at about 23 degrees, meaning that when one side is closest to the Sun, the other side is furthest away.\n\n\"As the Earth does a lap around the Sun each year, different parts of the planet get more sunlight than others.\n\n\"That's why it's winter in South Africa and summer in Europe.\n\nSo when the Southern Hemisphere has winter solstice, it's summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere.\"\n\nBotha added that in Latin, \"solstice\" roughly translates to \"Sun's standstill.\"\n\n\"As midwinter approaches, we see the Sun rise at a point further northward on the horizon each

Meteorological summer, in contrast, officially started on June 1 -- the reason why millions of Americans were already under extreme heat advisories in the hours leading up to the solstice.\n\nThe timing of the summer solstice naturally fluctuates between June 20 and 22. But it's an especially big deal this year, as it hasn't happened this early since 1796.\n\nThat summer solstice happened on June 20 at 1:24 p.m. \"Local Mean Time,\" according to The Weather Network.

To account for that extra quarter, the Gregorian calendar adds a day to February every four years: leap day.\n\nThe way the math works, solstices (and equinoxes) drift about 45 minutes earlier every four years. By the 2060s, leap year solstices will be earlier than anything in the 1700s, astrophysicist Ethan Siegel writes in Big Think.\n\nThat pattern is due to continue until 2096, which will see the earliest solstice of the century at 2:32 a.m. ET on June 20.\n\n\"It will be the only summer solstice that people in the Pacific time zone of the Americas will experience on June 19 for several hundreds of years!\" Seigel adds.\n\nThen, the calendar will reset.

Strawberry Moon Horoscope: How could the June full moon affect you according to your zodiac sign?\n\nSynonymous with the time of the year when students are on vacation and adults spend their time with them, summer is just around the corner.\n\nThere are two types of summer: the astronomical summer, which spans from the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox, and the meteorological summer, which comprises the months of June, July and August due to their similar weather behavior to each other.\n\nThere is also the myth that in the summer the days are longer. Is this true? The answer is a resounding yes for science, but only because of the light. This is due to the tilt of the Earth, which allows more hours of sunshine for outdoor activities.\n\nSummer 2024 will begin in the northern hemisphere on June 20, coinciding with the summer solstice. At 22:51, official peninsular time, the Earth will reach the point in its orbit where the Sun has its maximum declination to the north.\n\nThis event not only marks the beginning of summer, but also represents the day with the most daylight hours of the year. For approximately 93 days and 16 hours, the northern hemisphere will enjoy longer days and shorter nights, leading to a gradual increase in temperatures.\n\nFor the USA, the end of summer does not come until September, which is when classes and activity resumes in many companies and jobs, but the change to winter time does not occur until October 27, 2024, when we will change our clocks again, this time turning them back one hour.\n\nThe summer solstice is the exact time of the year when our star, the Sun, reaches its greatest apparent height in the Earth's sky. In the case of the summer solstice, it is the day that reaches its maximum length.\n\nOn the other hand, it is the night that has its longest course during the winter solstice. Although many believe that the longest day of the year is also the hottest, in reality, the hottest day is usually August 6.\n\nGeographically, the solstices mark the time when the Sun reaches its maximum latitude north or south of the equator.\n\nThen, on September 22, summer will give way to the autumnal equinox, the moment when nature changes its color palette and invites us to wrap up warm with scarves and dreams.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astrological sign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "September equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Employment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/5fd5a735f2345c47bb21c05a2cacf5f7/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/19/17188285416132.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 811, "textEnd": 818}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 1970, "textEnd": 1978}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-22", "textStart": 2108, "textEnd": 2120}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Details here", "body": "As the summer solstice has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere on Thursday, June 20, 2024, the question being asked in the astrological circle is- how will it affect human beings? The word 'solstice' is made up of two words- 'sol' meaning the Sun and 'sistere' meaning to stand still at a place. So solstice refers to the Sun standing at a place. During the summer solstice, the sun reaches its highest point in the sky as it is directly above the Tropic of Cancer. It makes the longest day with the shortest night in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe Sun appears to hover in its daily path overhead for about three days. It creates the illusion that the Sun is standing still. The Druids celebrated this period of standstill by gathering at Stonehenge. Modern-day astrologers believe that we can take a cue from this cosmic pause to reflect and realign our energies. Every zodiac sign can focus its contemplative efforts during the 2024 summer solstice.\n\nThe summer solstice is especially significant for the people born between June 22 and July 21 because, during the summer solstice, the Sun comes directly above the Tropic of Cancer and enters a new zodiac sign. For the people born under the zodiac sign of Cancer, it is the time to unlock good luck and embrace a potential wave of good fortune. Instead of being overly critical, they should allow themselves to grow and learn. They should focus on fostering a nurturing environment within and around them this summer.\n\nThose born between September 24 and October 23 come under the zodiac sign of Libra.

The minimum temperatures (on average) typically occur 4-6 weeks after the winter solstice, often in late July.\n\n\"This is because the oceans around Australia have a high heat capacity, meaning it takes them a long time to gain or lose heat.\n\n\"The ocean still loses heat for several weeks after the solstice and the colder oceans around Australia have a bigger influence on temperature than the marginally increased sunlight that arrives in the weeks following the solstice.\"\n\nWhen is it?\n\nJune 21\n\n6.50am AEST\n\n6.20am ACST\n\n4.50am AWST\n\nHow long are the 'shortest days'?\n\n\"The

longest day will be over 15 hours, while in Darwin the days vary between about 11.5 and 12.5 hours of sunlight throughout the year.\"\n\nHere's how much sunlight we'll get on the solstice

Meteorological summer, in contrast, officially started on June 1 -- the reason why millions of Americans were already under extreme heat advisories in the hours leading up to the solstice.\n\nThe timing of the summer solstice naturally fluctuates between June 20 and 22. But it's an especially big deal this year, as it hasn't happened this early since 1796.\n\nThat summer solstice happened on June 20 at 1:24 p.m. \"Local Mean Time,\" according to The Weather Network. It says LMT -- used before the U.S. introduced standard time in the late 19th century -- is close enough to ET that the comparison is valid.\n\nAt that point, George Washington was president of the U.S., which Tennessee had just joined as the 16th state.\n\nWhat explains the solstice's extra-prompt arrival, these 228 years later?\n\nThe shortest answer is quirks in the calendar.\n\nA typical year has 365 days, but that's not exactly how long the Earth takes to orbit the sun -- it's more like 365.24. To account for that extra quarter, the Gregorian calendar adds a day to February every four years: leap day.\n\nThe way the math works, solstices (and equinoxes) drift about 45 minutes earlier every four years. By the 2060s, leap year solstices will be earlier than anything in the 1700s, astrophysicist Ethan Siegel writes in Big Think.\n\nThat pattern is due to continue until 2096, which will see the earliest solstice of the century at 2:32 a.m. ET on June 20.\n\n\"It will be the only summer solstice that people in the Pacific time zone of the Americas will experience on June 19 for several hundreds of years!\" Seigel adds.\n\nThen, the calendar will reset. That's because 2100 won't be a leap year, since it's one of those fun Gregorian exceptions that are divisible by 100 but not 400.", "source": {"uri": "weku.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "weku.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_mean_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local mean time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standard time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leap year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars_and_Timekeeping", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars and Timekeeping", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/713534f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4395x2472+0+412/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F4395x3296%20417%200%2Fresize%2F4395x3296%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F6d%2Fe7160a26435ea6dc97dbb4e92228%2F2024-06-20t111424z-1554720808-mt1usatoday23584546-rtrmadp-3-it-was-not-your-calm-meditative-sunrise-for-the-summer.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "dateEnd": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 697, "textEnd": 711}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 502, "textEnd": 508}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 835, "textEnd": 842, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 1977, "textEnd": 1984}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The exact moment when the sun is at its highest point in the sky each year marks the solstice, and that will take place at 4:51 p.m. EDT.\n\nIt is also known as the longest day of of the year, as today, and the days surrounding it will have the most hours of daylight in a 24 hour period. The sun rises in Atlanta at 6:27am and will set today at 8:51pm, give us approximately 14 hours and 23 minuets of daylight. Daylight hours will get shorter from here.\n\nWhat makes this Summer Solstice special is the early start date. Summer time starts on June 21 during most calendar years.\n\nBut this year it begins a day early making it the earliest one since 1796 -- or when George Washington was president. The reason why involves a lot of astronomy and calendar fiddling.\n\nAccording to USA Today: \"The early solstice is due to the complex dance between Earth's yearly orbit around the sun and its daily rotation, along with how we mark the solstice on our calendars. Quirks in the Gregorian calendar mean the solstice will make another jump earlier every leap year until the year 2100.\"\n\nAlthough to is the first official day of Summer, here in north Georgia the weather has been hot enough that most believe summer began a while ago.\n\nThe height of the sun in the sky changes each day because Earth spins on an axis that is tilted roughly 3.5 degrees away from vertical. This means the northern hemisphere, where we live will lean toward or away from the sun depending on the time of year.\n\nThis is what gives Earth its seasons: When the northern half of the planet leans toward the sun, it experiences summer; at the same time, the southern half of the planet leans away from the sun, and is in winter. It is not known as the why the Earth has this tilt, but scientist believe the tilt is what lead to life on the planet.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice happens when Earth's tilt toward the sun is greatest. Even though the sun is at its highest peak, hotter temperatures occur during the months of July and August. Clearly it take time for the sun's light to warm the Earth.\n\nThe short answer is yes. All the planets in our solar system have an axial tilt, but some are tilted way more than others.\n\nVenus and Jupiter have only slight leans, around 3 degrees, while Mercury, at 0.03 degrees, is barely slanted at all. On the other hand, Uranus is oriented a whopping 97.8 degrees from vertical, causing one of its poles to point directly at the sun at times. That extreme tilt causes it to have some of the most dramatic seasons in our solar system.\n\nSaturn and Neptune both have tilts close to Earth's. So does Mars, at 25.2 degrees, although the red planet's tilt has shifted dramatically over millions of years.", "source": {"uri": "11alive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXIA-TV 11"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daylight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daylight saving time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leap year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axial tilt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uranus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neptune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (planet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saturn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jupiter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars_and_Timekeeping", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars and Timekeeping", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extrasolar_Planets", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extrasolar Planets", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/ad244f4a-c188-4cee-a6a7-92e0321a1793/20240620T124606/ad244f4a-c188-4cee-a6a7-92e0321a1793_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 622, "textEnd": 629}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

In Anchorage, that equates to 19 hours, 21 minutes, and 29 seconds, from when the sun rises at 4:20 a.m. to when it sets at 11:42 p.m.\n\nOf course, we get our daylight from the sun, but to get that light, we have to be facing the sun.\n\nLucky for us in Alaska, the earth is tilted on a roughly 23.5\u00b0 axis.\n\nThat means that this time of year, we're facing that giant ball of fire 93 million miles away for more hours than much of the globe.\n\nUtqiagvik, Kotzebue, Fort Yukon, and other locations north of the Arctic Circle see 24 hours of daylight on the summer solstice. But the closer to the equator you get, the shorter the daylight time, which continues to drop all the way to the South Pole where the sun doesn't shine at all this time of year.\n\nThis all changes the day after the summer solstice.\n\nAt 12:50 p.m. on June 20, the earth's tilt toward the sun reached its maximum, with the most direct sunlight pointed at the Tropic of Cancer located at 23.5\u00b0 latitude north.\n\nHowever, as we move around the sun, those direct rays will move south, eventually making it all the way back to the Tropic of Capricorn on Dec. 21.\n\nIf the earth weren't tilted, we'd all have about 12 hours of daylight year-round, meaning no seasons.\n\nThis year's solstice is noteworthy, as it's the earliest we've seen since 1796!\n\nThe exact moment of the solstices and equinoxes vary from year to year. This is because we count one revolution around the sun as 365 days, but it actually takes 365 days, 6 hours, and 9 minutes. We correct our calendar by adding leap years. By adding and taking away days, it moves the date of the solstice from June 20 to June 22, depending on where we are in that leap year correction cycle.\n\nWe do start losing daylight on Friday, but on the bright side, it's a slow process.

The summer solstice occurs for Earth's upper half when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted most closely toward the sun. This also marks the longest day and shortest night of the year.\n\nAround the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is at its most extreme tilt away from the sun, entering winter solstice and its shortest day of the year.\n\nSix months later, the halves will switch it up: The Northern Hemisphere will experience a winter solstice, and the Southern Hemisphere will have a summer solstice.\n\nWhat is an equinox?\n\nEquinoxes mark the start of spring and autumn, and happen when Earth's axis and orbit line up such that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.\n\nThe vernal equinox on March 19 kicked off spring, and the autumnal equinox on Sept. 22 will usher in fall.\n\nWhat is the strawberry moon?\n\nThis year's summer solstice comes with a treat: the first full moon of the summer, coined the strawberry moon.

But the actual, official first day of summer this year is June 20, 2024. This date is the astronomical beginning of the summer season known as the summer solstice. And we're ready to celebrate with these 50 inspiring summer solstice quotes!\n\nAlso known as estival solstice or (sometimes) Midsummer, the summer solstice is the exact moment when the sun reaches its farthest point from the celestial equator in its path through the sky. For the northern part of Earth, this will be on Thursday, June 20, 2024, at 4:51 p.m. EST, according to Almanac. At that precise time, the North Pole will be at its maximum tilt toward the sun, making the sun appear the highest in the sky and giving those of us on Earth the most daylight hours and the shortest night of the calendar year. Conversely, the daylight hours are the shortest on this day in the Southern Hemisphere and the sun is at its lowest point, as the June solstice marks the start of winter.\n\nSince the date of the June Solstice is an astronomical event based on when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky (and not a date on the traditional Gregorian calendar), it can vary from year to year -- but it is always somewhere between June 20 and June 22.\n\nAre you ready to greet the warm weather and longer days with open arms?

The timing of the summer solstice is when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky.\n\nIt is the longest day of the year, and after the summer solstice, the days will get shorter until the winter solstice on Dec. 21.\n\nHere are some fun facts as we celebrate the summer solstice! The word solstice comes from the Latin words for \"sol,\" for sun, and \"sistere,\" which means \"to stand still.\"\n\nTwice each year, the angle of the Earth's axis sits so that neither pole tilts toward or away from the sun.\n\nDuring each equinox, the amount of daylight and darkness is nearly equal at all latitudes, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nEquinox comes from the Latin words \"aequus,\" which means equal, and \"nox,\" which means night.\n\nPeople across the U.S. and the world celebrate the summer solstice with events, festivals and more.\n\nIn Michigan, residents can get free ice cream to celebrate the solstice from Kroger, according to a release from the grocery store.\n\nKroger will be giving away 45,000 pints of free ice cream. The offer includes pints of the Kroger Brand Deluxe Tie Dye Burst, Mint Chocolate Chip, Vivid Vanilla and Chocolate Chip.\n\nMichigan-based Savvy Sliders is also offering $1 shakes to celebrate the start of summer on Thursday.\n\nThe Cranbrook Art Museum in Bloomfield Hills will host a summer solstice event on Thursday from 4:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.\n\nThe Summer Solstice Celebration features a music performance with a synthesizer with a solar panel, a dance performance from Cranbrook Schools alumni, and a performance featuring a duo of percussion and a Buccula synthesizer.\n\nAfter the performances, there will be a sunset dance party. There will also be dried floral crowns for sale, art-making activities, and food from Bombshell Treat Bar and Tacos Hernandez.

She joined PEOPLE in 2021, but has eight years of experience working in digital publishing with a focus on entertainment and pop culture news.\n\nThe start of a new season is here, so let's celebrate!\n\nThe 2024 summer solstice arrives on June 20, marking the shortest night and longest day of the year as the Northern Hemisphere officially transitions from winter to summer.\n\nThere are a number of ways to celebrate the event, whether it be through physical traditions or astrological rituals and manifestations. In fact, the arrival of summer has been welcomed for centuries and dates back to our ancestors in ancient times.\n\nThe summer solstice is celebrated differently around the world through unique festivities and observances, like the famed gathering at Stone Henge in England to watch the sun through the thousand-year-old monuments. Feasts, bonfires, picnics and traditional songs are a few other ways the change of season is honored.\n\nIn addition to cultural practices, astrologer Evan Nathaniel tells PEOPLE of a few ways to make the most of the summer solstice energy leading up to the astronomical event and in the months that follow. \"It's that time to really be joyful and celebrate your accomplishments, your authenticity and express yourself creatively,\" he says.\n\nWhy? \"Because the sun represents that spirit, that vitality and that energy,\" Nathaniel explains. \"It's bringing light, enlightening us, eliminating and giving us that power... like a resurrection.\"\n\nThis energy is especially true in comparison to the winter solstice, the summer solstice's cold and dark counterpart. \"After the winter solstice, we start to climb back towards gaining more self-awareness and achieving self-actualization,\" he says. \"The summer solstice is that peak in light.\"\n\nRead on for the various astrology rituals you can take part in to celebrate the summer solstice this year!\n\nAstrologer Evan Nathaniel tells PEOPLE that the change of season brings \"really nice moment to reflect on the last six months\" as those who live in the Northern Hemisphere transition from winter to summer.\n\nFor many, New Year's resolutions were created around the winter solstice just before the start of 2024. Nathaniel says now is a great time to analyze those goals and note what you have achieved and what you can do reach them if you haven't.\n\nWhat makes this summer solstice \"special,\" according to Nathaniel, is the arrival of June's full moon the next day. The lunation will allow for manifestation energy to ring out over the next few months -- while, the day of the summer solstice is a time to \"have fun, celebrate and just enjoy yourself.\"\n\nAs we celebrate, Nathaniel says we should be \"thinking about the next six months and where we want to be by the next winter solstice.\" He adds, \"There's always more room for growth.\"\n\nAs we reflect and refine our goals from the past six months, Nathaniel says the summer solstice is also a time to \"release the things we don't need to continue traveling forward with a really clear sense of directness and purpose\" in our lives.\n\nThe sun, Nathaniel says, is \"very much about our authentic self shining through.\" Therefore, the summer solstice can symbolize a benchmark in our lives to determine what we need to \"detach from\" so that our \"authentic self can consistently be seen.\"\n\nThe day after the summer solstice, Nathaniel suggests \"releasing things that are not in accordance with our longterm goals.\" He calls this a \"release ritual,\" one that we can \"go through based on what we're naturally drawn and attracted to\" as individuals.\n\nMentally organizing your goals from the past six months and visualizing what you'd like to accomplish in the six months ahead are two ways to capitalize on the summer solstice energy, though Nathaniel says physically jotting down your goals and manifestations is another ritual to utilize.\n\n\"My recommendation for the summer solstice would be to get a journal and reflect backwards on the past six months -- and if you have those New Year's resolutions, look at them,\" he says. \"What were they six months ago and evaluate from that standpoint. Are you on or off track? What do you need to change to continue to grow?\" he suggests asking yourself.\n\nWhile Nathaniel says this ritual will likely \"be the same\" for everyone regardless of your zodiac sign, he says it's important to note your \"rising sign\" and your \"sun and moon sign.\" He explains, \"Because that's where you have a powerful release.\"\n\nIt's also important to note that June's lunation will be a full moon in Capricorn, which Nathaniel considers \"positive\" timing for this practice because it's a zodiac sign that shines a light on \"public identity.\" He says, \"The things that you release are really setting you up for success in the long run.\"\n\nFortunately, we'll experience two full moons in Capricorn this year (the second rising on July 21). Nathaniel says we'll have \"two attempts\" to \"release\" and \"clear out\" the energy that doesn't align with our goals.\n\nCreating a \"burn list\" is another \"very common release ritual\" Nathaniel says people practice around the change of season. \"The summer solstice is the end of self-consciousness,\" he says.\n\n\"It's just that joyful moment where you realize you don't have to calibrate your identity according to what other people think or who they think you should be,\" he adds. Plus, this is a great method even if you \"don't know your rising sign\" and still want to maximize the solstice energy.\n\n\"Just burn self-consciousness,\" Nathaniel says.\n\nCharging your crystals is another ritual to celebrate the summer solstice because the event is a period of \"abundance, growth, and the peak of solar energy,\" astrologer Valerie Mesa tells PEOPLE.\n\n\"Charging crystals during the summer solstice can be incredibly potent, given the sun's strength as an ever-glowing luminary and the spiritual symbolism of initiation and renewal behind this widely known celebration,\" she adds.\n\nThe crystals Mesa suggests charging? \"I recommend charging crystals associated with the sun such as Sunstone, Carnelian, Tiger's eye and Citrine, to name a few,\" she says.\n\nMesa compares the practice to charging crystals around the full moon's peak because the sun \"reaches the highest point in the sky in the Northern Hemisphere which can amplify crystal energies.\"\n\nFor the summer solstice specifically, Mesa advises taking your crystals outside at 4:50 p.m. ET when the event peaks. \"Go out there, say a little mantra or prayer and make your magic!\"\n\nSince the sun is our greatest source of energy and vitality, Mesa says \"charging crystals at this time can essentially deepen your connection with the sun, a representation of our life force.\" However, she stresses bringing them inside before sundown.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astrology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bonfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resurrection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lunar month"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_(astrology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capricorn (astrology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astrological sign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnelian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carnelian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_(esotericism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy (esotericism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mantra"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Crystals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Crystals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/RZ3bos7QcPqKda5McCRbKO_jlgo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(776x374:778x376)/Summer-Solstice-Stonehenge-061824-d22bf2d91f6a4b3fac6aa2ada554182f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 308, "textEnd": 315}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 4945, "textEnd": 4952}], "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The sun will be at its highest position in the sky for the year today, causing our longest day and shortest night.\n\nThe reason we experience seasons is because Earth orbits the sun on a tilt. This tilt, 23.5 degrees to be specific, causes each hemisphere to be tilted towards, away, or alongside the sun as it orbits throughout the year. During the summer solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, causing 24 hours of daylight for areas north of the Arctic circle, and 24 hours of nighttime for areas south of the Antarctic circle.\n\nAccording to TimeandDate, for us here in Michigan, the sun reaches its maximum angle during solar noon at roughly 70 degrees. In contrast, during the winter solstice, the sun only gets up to 23 degrees! This change in the sun angle causes more direct solar radiation in the summer, and less solar radiation in the winter. Think of shining a flashlight directly down at a surface, and then shining it on a surface but at a low angle. The intensity of the light at any one point is much higher when the light is more direct.\n\nThe more intense solar radiation in the summer, due to the higher sun angle, causes our warmest months. In contrast, the least intense solar radiation in the winter, due to the lower sun angle, causes our coldest months.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the summer solstice does not exactly align with our latest sunset of the year. According to EarthSky, near the summer solstice, the solar day still gets longer by a fraction of a minute for around a week after the solstice. This then causes a general shift in the sunrise and sunset times.\n\nFor Grand Rapids, the latest sunset falls on June 26 at 9:25 p.m. During the winter, the earliest sunset is at 5:07 p.m. This falls several days before the winter solstice for the same reasons.\n\nOne of the reasons western Michigan experiences such late sunsets is our relation to the time zone. Michigan is on the western-most part of the Eastern time zone. So, on a map, we are quite a distance from locations along the East Coast, but in the same time zone. This then causes our sunsets to occur quite late. Similarly, in terms of location, western Michigan is relatively close to locations on the eastern part of the Central time zone, say Chicago. So, while the sun may set in the sky at very similar moments in time in Grand Rapids and Chicago, according to the clock, there is almost an hour difference.\n\nThis year, June's full Moon, termed the Strawberry Moon, happens to fall just one day after the solstice. TimeandDay reports that this happens about once every 20 years. So, after the incredibly late sunset, the nearly full moon will help guide you during the night. Make sure to head outside and enjoy before the much-dreaded winter rolls around.", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar irradiance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antarctic Circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth's orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arctic Circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synodic day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Rapids, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand Rapids, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars_and_Timekeeping", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars and Timekeeping", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Winter", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Winter", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/EAEEK44LVBC67DSP3ZM3T4T5YM.JPG?auth=21229168aebc8114896dd6f9d2f2fb7906c658f0317f6640abf9635327a36c8f&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1689, "textEnd": 1696}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

When the Earth's poles tilt towards the sun, the solstice begins, bringing with it the longest day of the year. Midsummer has been celebrated around the world and by different cultures since the Stone Age (at least that's when there was the first recorded evidence). Honoring the solstice gives us a chance to appreciate the circle of life, Earth, and nature. A new season is dawning, and with that comes new opportunities. The following day, the first full moon of summer lights up the sky, allowing us to manifest our heart's desires for the upcoming months. All the more reason why the summer solstice 2024 is nothing short of magical.\n\nLooking for ways to celebrate the summer solstice? Check out these recommendations for your zodiac sign.\n\nBeing that you're a fire sign, candle magic is sublime. Use a gold candle (the color of the sun) and carve your name on it. Think of a hope you want to bring to fruition. Write it down on paper, fold it up, and place it under a bowl of ice water. Put the candle in the bowl. Light the candle as you think of your aspiration. As it burns, envision your dreams taking flight.\n\nOne way to your heart is through good food. When paired with the company of those you care about and made with love, the taste is even sweeter. Indulge in the merriment by planning a decadent outdoor feast with friends. Gather your crew for an evening of storytelling, singing, reminiscing, manifesting, and dancing with fresh seasonal fruit, vegetables, and cakes. The laughs and memories you create with your squad during the solstice will last forever.\n\nVolunteer at a charity event to embrace your humanitarian side and give back to the community. Whether it be tutoring, teaching yoga, or drawing caricatures, your time will be well spent connecting with neighbors for a good cause. Also, you'll be able to socialize and meet like-minded people who could become your new pals -- so be sure to get their IG handle and invite them to any upcoming gatherings this summer.\n\nA reset with nature is the best medicine. This is your season, so it'll benefit you to connect with nature, especially the element of water. If you are able to meditate on the beach, or by a lake or pond, you'll feel the energy heal and cleanse your aura. It'll be restorative and rejuvenating to your body, mind, and spirit, allowing you to take on anything that comes your way this summer with gusto and determination.\n\nSign up for the My Astrologer Said newsletter here\n\nWe all know that you like to be showy, which is why wearing bright hues like red, orange, and yellow is a must for the solstice. Color magic will help in attracting confidence during the summer season. You'll be able to rev up the mood and maintain a positive atmosphere. Plus, these colors will enchant others to be drawn towards you. These sunny shades will strengthen your spirit as well as the feels of your besties.\n\nPlant seeds for the future. Gardening while setting an intention will not only make your visions a reality, but also show Mother Earth how thankful you are for bestowing lush greenery, beauty, and abundance upon you. As you carefully place the seeds in the soil, state an aspiration that you wish to bring to life. The full moon on June 21 (the day after the solstice) will cement your hopes and desires to come true.\n\nUsually, you put the needs of others before yours. The warm weather and sunny skies are encouraging YOU to focus on YOU. Get a mani-pedi with cool nail art, change your hair color (apricot is an ideal choice this season), or post thirst traps on social media. You're ready to take the lead and do things that make you happy on your terms without having to answer to anyone (except your parents, who'll be onboard).\n\nThe solstice is an extremely potent time. Use the solar energy to charge crystals (particularly topaz, citrine, carnelian, sunstone, and orange calcite), tarot and oracle decks, pendulums, and other magical tools. This amplifies the vibe they give off, as well as uncovers spiritual messages from the universe. Lay them under the sun (either outside or inside by a windowsill) and let these objects soak up the rays to provide greatness and authenticity to readings.\n\nAlthough you're joined at the hip with your BFF and significant other, you could use a moment to check in and reconnect with yourself. Journal your emotions and take stock of how you feel during the solstice. You might even want to take your notebook to the park or backyard and write down your innermost sentiments as the sun illuminates its glow upon you to ensure that you're aligning with the truest version of yourself.\n\nIf you're crushing on someone or wanting to DTR, the solstice is a great day to let your feelings known. Write a letter to your boo and hand deliver it to them. Your words will speak to their heart and passions. Chances are, you'll have a summer romance blossoming ASAP. As long as you're honest and ready to jump into love, the odds will be in your favor. You'll be hard launching by summer's end.\n\nYou've been burning the midnight oil by putting your studies above play, and you are beginning to experience mild burnout. Now that school is in recess for the summer season, it's time for you to get some R&R. A simple way to decompress during the solstice is to gather fresh lavender and mint twigs. Combine the two into a sachet and place under your pillow to ensure you get peaceful rest to restore your vitality.\n\nSince creativity is on your mind, put your artistry to work! Making a beautiful solstice inspired sun catcher for your home or for a friend's dwelling will not only ignite your talents, but also bring joy. You relish in DIY activities that spark your imagination. This particular project will be especially meaningful because it will connect you to nature and be made with TLC.

It is the day when the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky and gives us the longest day of the year.\n\nFor many centuries, people have been giving meaning to unusual astronomical phenomena and performing festive rites and rituals during them. OBOZ.UA tells in more detail how different nations celebrate the solstice.\n\nWhen is the solstice in 2024?\n\nThe summer solstice is considered the beginning of the astronomical summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere. This year, it will occur on June 20. The sun will rise at 4:46 a.m. and set at 9:13 p.m., so the day will last for 16 hours and 27 minutes.\n\nSolstice in the world\n\nSuch an astronomical phenomenon as the summer solstice has been well known to Europeans since the Neolithic period, when the first megalithic observatories like Stonehenge were built. Their purpose was to pinpoint the day when the Sun would be at its highest point. Similar structures, such as circles lined with stones, are found in Ukraine.\n\nEvery nation gave the day of the summer solstice a special meaning and celebrated it. Its main traditions and elements in many cultures were gathering herbs, making bonfires, bathing, and magical rituals and beliefs. The fact that the games and rituals in different cultures coincide indicates the ancient origin of the holiday from a common Indo-European root.\n\nUkraine, Eastern and Western Slavs\n\nThe day of the summer solstice had a special meaning for ancient Ukrainians. With the advent of Christianity, it was renamed Ivan Kupala and became associated with the birthday of the Forerunner John the Baptist.\n\nEastern Slavs in eastern Poland and southern Lithuania also celebrate Ivan Kupala.\n\nLatvia\n\nLatvia has a traditional annual Latvian holiday in honor of the summer solstice called Ligo. It is celebrated on the night of June 23-24. The use of plants for decorative, medicinal, and other purposes is important in the celebration of Ligo. Latvians also weave wreaths, jump over a fire, look for fern flowers, and sing traditional songs.\n\nEstonia\n\nIn Estonia, the holiday dedicated to the summer solstice is called Jaanip\u00e4\u00e4 and coincides with the celebration of the day of victory in the Battle of Venden over the Baltic Landeswehr, the memory and struggle of all Estonians, and St. John's Day.\n\nFinland\n\nThe Finns and Ingermanlanders have a holiday called Johannus. It is named after John the Baptist. Since 1955, it has been celebrated on the first Saturday after June 19. During the celebration, it is customary to decorate the house, boat and other places where people gather with birch branches and light a big fire.\n\nSweden\n\nSince 1953, Sweden has had a midsummer holiday. Like the Finns, it is celebrated on the first Saturday after June 19. The main Swedish celebrations, such as the installation of a promise pole, take place on the eve of the holiday.\n\nPortugal\n\nIn Portugal, the summer solstice is celebrated as the feast of St. John. Local Catholics also believe in the purifying power of bonfires.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

harvest.\n\nThe longest day of the year is marked across the world - and has been celebrated by people across human history, too.\n\nArcheologists have suggested ancient Mayan complexes built 3000 years ago in Central America marked summer and winter solstices, serving as sites for public ceremonies.\n\nMany Indigenous people throughout the US and Canada celebrate the year's longest day with a ceremonial Sun Dance, performed differently by different tribes.\n\nThe tradition is thought to have originated with the Sioux people, spreading throughout the Great Plains in the early 19th century by neighbouring tribes.\n\nIn the UK, thousands gather each year at Stonehenge, an approximately 4500-year-old stone circle near Salisbury in Wiltshire.\n\nAccording to Heritage England, the stones were erected in 2500 BC and were designed to align with the movements of the sun.\n\nAs well as marvelling at the way the sunlight streams through the ancient stones, some revelers perform pagan rituals to mark the solstice.\n\nTo experience the end of 2024's longest day for yourself, head outside at 9:50pm (BST) to catch the last rays of light.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType":

Here, she spoke to FEMAIL\n\nThe monument built on the alignment of the midsummer sunrise and the midwinter sunset. It is believed that solstices have been celebrated at Stonehenge for thousands of years.\n\nThe date of the equinoxes and solstices varies because the Gregorian calendar does not exactly match the length of the tropical year - the time it takes the Earth to complete an orbit around the Sun. To realign the calendar with the tropical year, a leap day is introduced every four years and when this happens, the equinox and solstice dates shift back to the earlier date.\n\nJanis King, who Master tarot reader, author and spiritual coach based in London, told FEMAIL, that the 'awesome' power of the sun makes the solstice the perfect opportunity for 'personal transformation'.\n\n'The summer solstice is a celebration of the sun's energy at its peak, and it is an energy we all experience and share,' she said.\n\nJanis, who reads tarot professionally, explained that the sun tarot card 'represents a joyful celebration of life' and 'reminds us to see life clearly, without the shadow of fear'.\n\n'It tells us that \"Joy\" in life is not an optional extra,' Janis continued. 'It is, instead, a necessary component of an abundant life experience. The sun also connects us powerfully to the earth and its power.\n\n'The summer solstice is a celebration of the sun's energy at its peak, and it is an energy we all experience and share.\n\n'Have you noticed how everything seems more possible in the sun?\n\nStock image. Despite heavy downpours and weeks of grey clouds, the time has come for Britain to celebrate the longest day of the year today with the annual summer solstice\n\nIt is believed that solstices have been celebrated at Stonehenge for thousands of years. Stock image used\n\n'As the longest day of the year with the most sunlight, we can embrace the sun symbolically as a symbol of intuitive power and personal transformation.'\n\nTraditionally, solstice was marked by Celtic, Slavic and Germanic communities, who lit bonfires with the intention of increasing the sun's strength for the remainder of the crop season to ensure a healthy harvest.\n\nNature and sun are tightly woven in the belief that solstice can channel such power. To best utilise this, Janis advised planting a new seed outside in the midst of nature.\n\n'As your hands connect with the earth, perhaps reflect on that connection and how you, with the sun's energy, are a positive part of this magical process of life,' she suggested.\n\n'Promise yourself that you will stay conscious of this, nurturing both yourself and your life as you do this plant.'\n\nNext, she encouraged 'setting intentions'.\n\nThis can be done by writing our wishes on a piece of paper before burning them which 'releases your intention to the power of the energetic world to bring it to fruition'.\n\n'The Summer solstice is an energetically charged day and an important one to set intentions,' she added.\n\nThe expert also stressed that it is important 'feel gratitude' during this process.\n\nRead More Is your house haunted? Psychic medium TJ Higgs reveals the tell-tale signs of a ghostly presence in your home\n\n'An important part of the manifestation process is to feel gratitude for what we want before we even have it,' Janis stated.\n\n'When we do this, telling the universe we trust that our wishes will be fulfilled and that we are calling in the energy we desire and thanking the universe in advance,' she explained.\n\nA second spiritualist, American energy alchemist and Reiki reader, Julie Baldino, suggested spending as much as the day as possible outdoors.\n\n'In honour of the fiery and sunny energy of summer solstice, create an outdoor altar with candles, tune in to nature, soak up the sun while you meditate and journal,' she added.\n\n'Summer solstice should be about directing new energy and passion towards intentions, contemplating the progress made, and identifying action steps to aid in manifestation.'\n\nWhen writing intentions, she advised 'using direct \"I am\" statements as well as jotting down action steps that can be take to move towards those intentions manifesting'.\n\nDuring the long day of sunlight, the Arctic also will likely experience a 'polar day' of complete light for 24 hours.\n\nAs the Earth orbits the sun in its yearly cycle, it also turns on its axis exposing different parts to the sun's light - creating the cycle of days and nights.\n\nIt is this tilt which gives Earth the regular progression of the seasons and creates the solstice.\n\nThis year's summer has arrived almost a full day early, with today marking the earliest solstice since 1796.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tarot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midsummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediumship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leap year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wiltshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wiltshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germanic languages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bonfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/New_Age", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/New Age", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/14/86367647-0-image-m-21_1718890809064.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

To be more precise, when the solstice occurs, the sun will appear to be shining directly overhead for a point on the Tropic of Cancer (latitude 23.5 degrees north) in the eastern Pacific Ocean, roughly 1,100 statute miles (1,800 kilometers) southwest of Los Angeles.\n\nFrom mid-northern latitudes, we can never see the sun directly overhead, but (as an example) as seen from Boston at 12:46 p.m. EDT on solstice day, the sun will attain its highest point in the sky for this entire year, standing 71 degrees above the southern horizon. To gauge how high that is, your clenched fist held at arm's length measures roughly 10 degrees, so from the city known locally as \"The Hub,\" the sun will appear to climb more than seven fists above the southern horizon. And, since the sun will appear to describe such a high arc across the sky, the duration of daylight will be at its most extreme, lasting 15 hours and 17 minutes.\n\nBut this doesn't mean that we can stargaze for the nearly nine hours remaining on solstice day, because we also need to take twilight into consideration. Around the time of the June solstice, at latitude 40 degrees north, morning and evening twilight each last two hours, so the sky is fully dark for only five hours.\n\nFarther north, twilight lasts even longer. At 45 degrees, it lingers for 2.5 hours, and at 50 degrees, twilight persists through the entire night; the sky never gets completely dark. In contrast, heading south, the duration of twilight is shorter. At latitude 30 degrees, it lasts 96 minutes, while at the latitude of San Juan, Puerto Rico, it lingers for only 80 minutes. That's why travelers from the northern U.S. who visit the Caribbean at this time of year are so surprised at how quickly it gets dark after sunset, compared to back home.\n\nIncidentally, the earliest sunrise and latest sunset do not coincide with the summer solstice. The former occurred on June 14, while the latter does not come until June 27.\n\nRelated: The brightest planets in June's night sky: How to see them (and when)\n\nMost people are probably under the impression that Earth is closest to the sun in its orbit at this time of year, but actually, it's just the opposite. In fact, on July 5, at 1:06 a.m. EDT (0506 GMT), we'll be at that point in our orbit farthest from the sun (called aphelion), a distance of 94,510,539 miles (152,099,969 km). Conversely, it was back on Jan. 2 that Earth was at perihelion, its closest point to the sun. The difference in distance between these two extremes is 3,106,444 miles (4,999,337 km), or 3.3%, which makes a difference in radiant heat received by Earth of nearly 7%. Thus, for the Northern Hemisphere, the difference should warm our winters and cool our summers.\n\nHowever, in reality, the preponderance of large land masses in the Northern Hemisphere works the other way, generally making our winters colder and our summers hotter than those of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nInterestingly, it would be a much different story if we were on Mars. Compared to our nearly circular orbit, the Red Planet's orbit is noticeably more eccentric (elliptical). When Mars arrives at aphelion, it is receiving only 69% as much sunlight as it does at perihelion. This situation creates a seasonal asymmetry; Mars' southern hemisphere always experiences greater extremes between summer and winter than the northern hemisphere.\n\n-- 365 days of satellite images show Earth's seasons changing from space (video)\n\n-- Planet Earth: Everything you need to know\n\nAfter the sun arrives at its solstice point, it will begin to migrate back toward the south, and the amount of daylight in the Northern Hemisphere will begin to decrease. Consider this: After June 20, day length will not begin to increase again until three days before Christmas. But actually, if you think about it, the sun has been taking a high arc across the sky, and the length of daylight has been rather substantial since about the middle of May. And the lowering of the sun's path in the sky and the diminishing of the daylight hours in the coming days and weeks will, at least initially, be rather subtle.\n\nAug. 1 is marked on some Christian calendars as Lammas Day, whose name is derived from the Old English \"loaf-mass,\" because it was once observed as a harvest festival and was traditionally considered to be the middle of the summer season. In actuality, however, summer's midpoint -- that moment that comes exactly between the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox in 2024 -- will not occur until Aug. 6 at 12:47 p.m. EDT (1647 GMT). On that day, again, as seen from Boston, the sun will set at 7:56 p.m., with the loss of daylight since June 21 amounting to just 63 minutes.\n\nBut it is in the second half of summer that the effects of the southward shift of the sun's direct rays start becoming much more noticeable. In fact, when autumn officially arrives on Sept. 22, the sun for Bostonians will be setting well before seven in the evening (6:41 p.m.), while the length of daylight will have been reduced by more than two hours (two hours and 6 minutes, to be precise) since Aug. 6.\n\nBaseball Hall of Famer Yogi Berra mostly played catcher for the Yankees. He occasionally played left field, however, and said that he didn't mind the outfield, except during August and September. During that time of year, the shadows across the ballfield progressively lengthened in the afternoon, making it increasingly difficult for him to see a baseball hit in his direction. Yogi might not have been able to explain the science of why the altitude of the sun lowered so perceptibly during the latter half of the summer, but -- as only Yogi could do -- he was able to sum it all up in a simple Yogism: \"It's getting late early out there.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On the day of the winter solstice last year, the amount of daylight received in San Antonio was 10 hours, 15 minutes and 34 seconds. Fast forward six months, and the amount of daylight received on the day of the summer solstice measures 14 hours, 1 minute and 54 seconds.\n\nGoing forward from June 20, the daylight amount will start to decrease all the way up to the next winter solstice, which will occur on Saturday, December 21, 2024. And thus the cycle continues.\n\nGet weekly updates from the KSAT Weather Authority by subscribing to the free Whatever the Weather newsletter.\n\nEmail AddressSign up.\n\nSo how will this affect our sunrise and sunset times in South Central Texas?\n\nIn a general sense, sunset times will be at their latest in the immediate days ahead, and will slowly start to get earlier and earlier all the way up to the beginning of December.\n\nCheck out the table for San Antonio below:\n\nDaySunrise Times in San AntonioSunset Times in San AntonioJune 20, 2024 (Summer Solstice)6:34 AM8:36 PMJuly 1, 20246:38 AM8:37 PMAugust 1, 20246:54 AM8:25 PMSeptember 1, 20247:11 AM7:55 PMOctober 1, 20247:27 AM7:18 PMNovember 1, 20247:47 AM6:47 PMNovember 3, 2023 (Daylight Saving Time Ends)6:49 AM5:45 PMDecember 1, 20247:11 AM5:34 PMDecember 21, 2024 (Winter Solstice)7:24 AM5:40 PMDecember 31, 20247:28 AM5:46 PM\n\nAfter looking at this table you may be asking -- why doesn't the earliest sunset occur on the winter solstice, when the northern hemisphere is tilted the farthest away from the sun?\n\nIt all has to do with the fact that time measured by the sun is not exactly the same as time measured by our clocks.\n\nAfter the sun rises in the east and before it sets in the west, it passes over an invisible line that runs from north to south known as the meridian. This is when it is positioned highest in the sky, and when it reaches \"solar noon.\" The time between one solar noon to the next is the \"apparent solar day\" and can be measured by a sundial.\n\nWe would often think that the length of a solar day would be exactly 24 hours, but that's not the case. While the Earth's spin is never more than a few milliseconds faster or slower in a given day, a solar day can be up to 22 seconds shorter or 29 seconds longer than a 24-hour period.\n\nRead more from the meteorologists on the Whatever the Weather pageDownload KSAT's weather app for customized, accurate forecasts in San Antonio, South Texas or wherever you areFind the latest forecasts, radar and alerts on the KSAT Weather Authority page", "source": {"uri": "ksat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_montgomery@ksat.com", "name": "Mia Montgomery", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSAT-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KSAT-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daylight saving time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Synodic day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meridian (geography)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millisecond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars_and_Timekeeping", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars and Timekeeping", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/Q2VAZPX3GBE2ZBTNVDK5WYDWTU.png?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 690, "textEnd": 697}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The summer solstice occurs for Earth's upper half when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted most closely toward the sun. This also marks the longest day and shortest night of the year.\n\nAround the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is at its most extreme tilt away from the sun, entering winter solstice and its shortest day of the year.\n\nSix months later, the halves will switch it up: The Northern Hemisphere will experience a winter solstice, and the Southern Hemisphere will have a summer solstice.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The official solstice is planned for 4:51 p.m. The earth will be at its maximum tilt toward the sun, which will appear at its highest elevation in the sky.\n\nMarking the event will be a small group from Hofstra University, led by Professor Donald Lubowich, which will travel to Washington, D.C., Thursday in preparation for its annual Solstice Saturday program and Hofstra's Astronomy Festival on the National Mall. The program is designed to offer solar and nighttime telescope observations while promoting astronomy and science.\n\n\"The goal is to bring astronomy to the public and people coming to the National Mall,\" Lubowich said. \"It's significance is it's the longest day [of sunlight] of the year. Many cultures have celebrated it and it brings hands-on activities for kids of all ages and interest in careers in science.\"\n\nThe summer solstice has been a key date in traditions for Native American tribes and ancient cultures, including ancient Greece and the ruins at Stonehenge, Lubowich said.\n\nHe said he started the event with the Smithsonian Institution about 14 years ago, using a grant from NASA to co-sponsor an event of music and astronomy under the stars.\n\nOn Saturday, Lubowich and other local amateur astronomers will set up dozens of telescopes, puzzles and games on the National Mall.\n\nLubowich said although Thursday will mark the longest daylight opportunity of the year, the earliest sunrise occurred June 14 and the latest sunset will be June 28.\n\nAnd though the solstice marks the beginning of astrological summer, it's not always great for star gazing, said Jason Cousins, president of Amateur Observers' Society New York.

Long before Europeans arrived, the ancestors of Native Hawaiians were the world's greatest navigators.\n\nThey traveled vast distances across the Pacific Ocean, guided by their deep understanding of the natural world.\n\n\"Our ancestors were incredible observers of the stars, the sun, the weather, the winds and the waves,\" Blake said. \"They had a profound connection to what we call the language of nature.\"\n\nDuring the summer solstice, the sun reaches its furthest point north in the sky. Ancient Pacific Islanders knew this because they carefully tracked the sun's movement throughout the year. They understood that the Earth was round long before it was widely accepted by other cultures, thanks to their observations and travels.\n\nOne special place that holds great significance during the summer solstice is Mokumanamana, a small island located near the Tropic of Cancer at 23.5 degrees north latitude.\n\nThis line, known as ke ala polohiwa a K\u0101ne, marks the boundary between the world of humans and the realms of the gods and spirits. It is a place where ancient Hawaiians made important observations about the sun and the stars.\n\nBlake shared that Mokumanamana was not a permanent settlement but a site for significant rituals and observations. During the summer solstice, the sun would appear directly overhead at this latitude, making it a crucial marker for understanding the changing seasons.\n\n\"Our ancestors knew that this was the northernmost point the sun would reach,\" Blake explained. \"After the solstice, the sun begins its journey southward again.\"\n\nThis knowledge was essential for navigation and for understanding the cycles of nature. The summer solstice marked the beginning of the drier months in Hawai\u02bbi, a time known as kauwela. It was a period when the days were longest, allowing for more daylight to conduct important activities and ceremonies.\n\nBlake's passion for sharing this knowledge was evident as he spoke. He emphasized the importance of remembering and honoring these ancient traditions, which connect modern Native Hawaiians to their ancestors and the natural world.\n\nAs the summer solstice approached, Blake reflected on the wisdom of his ancestors. They had used their keen observations and understanding of nature to thrive in the vast Pacific Ocean. The solstice was more than just a day on the calendar; it was a reminder of the deep connection between the Hawaiian people and the world around them.\n\nWith the longest day of the year upon them, Blake and the people of Hawai\u02bbi looked forward to the changing seasons. Guided by the wisdom of their ancestors and the enduring language of nature, they celebrated the summer solstice with gratitude and respect for the natural world.\n\nBlake's story serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving and honoring cultural traditions. The summer solstice, with its rich history and significance, continues to inspire and connect the people of Hawai\u02bbi to their roots and the ever-changing world around them.", "source": {"uri": "khon2.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KHON2"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandy_harjo_livingston@khon2.com", "name": "Sandy Harjo-Livingston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Native Hawaiians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_Native_Hawaiians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culture of the Native Hawaiians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_Island_(Hawaii)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Necker Island (Hawaii)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Necker Island (Hawaii)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesian_navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polynesian navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesian_Voyaging_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polynesian Voyaging Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catamaran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catamaran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Navigator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honolulu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Honolulu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u0101ne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u0101ne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zenith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Islander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Hawaii"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropic of Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.khon2.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2021/05/HOKULEA-2-e1655773348913.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Honolulu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The first day of summer always falls on the Summer Solstice. The Summer Solstice is the day when the sun is the highest in the sky and when we see the most hours of daylight, but it is NOT the hottest day of the year.\n\nIn this weather blog, I'm going to explain why the longest day of the year isn't the hottest day of the year!\n\nYou can see from the graph above that the average temperature doesn't match up with the hours of daylight. The temperature lags behind the daylight. The hottest time is several weeks after the summer solstice and the coldest time is after the winter solstice.\n\nThis is what causes the large temperature differences between the equinoxes. The average temperature on the Spring Equinox is 54.5\u00b0, while the Fall Equinox is 72.6\u00b0. That's nearly a 20\u00b0 swing despite both days having the same amount of energy from the sun.\n\nThis temperature delay is called seasonal lag.\n\nThis temperature lag is caused by the time required to heat up the ground and the oceans.\n\nThis is the same thing that causes the hottest time of the day to be several hours after noon. During the morning hours, most of the sun's energy is used to heat up the surface, and during the afternoon the still-powerful sun continues to heat. The afternoon heating ends once the sun is low in the sky.\n\nParts of the day can be correlated to the seasons. The overnight would be winter, the morning hours would be spring, the afternoon Summer, and the evening Fall. Winter solstice would be midnight and Summer solstice would be noon.\n\nAll this to say that it's going to get even hotter here in Arkansas...", "source": {"uri": "fox16.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KLRT - FOX16.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_libby@fox16.com", "name": "Alex Libby", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Degree (angle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "March equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seasonal lag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://www.fox16.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/2024/06/Daylight-vs-Temperature.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 37, "textEnd": 46}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

People have been marking the summer solstice at the historic site of Tara for thousands of years.\n\nThe summer solstice is one of the eight sacred days in Ireland, the times when the old Celtic world stopped to celebrate. Others include Imbolc (St. Brigid's Day), Bealtaine (May Day), and Samhain (Halloween). The summer solstice is marked in parts of Ireland by bonfires on the side of the road.\n\nIt is celebrated on the longest day of the year, which this year falls on June 20. In rural Ireland, communities gather for their local bonfire and celebrate the longest day of the year with song and dance.\n\nBack in 2015, the events at the Hill of Tara, depicted in the video below, were led by local man J. P. Fay, who carried a horned staff and dressed in a gabardine cloak with a depiction of Morrigu, the Celtic Goddess of War, on the back.\n\n\"If you scratch the ground here, you are not too far away from our old pagan beliefs,\" said Fay, who offered gifts of fruit, meat, wine, and spirits to the ancestors.\n\nPaul Dolan, a practicing male pagan witch, said he never misses solstice celebrations at the Hill of Tara.\n\n\"This is the turning point of the year, one of our major festivals.

But astronomical summer starts for the northern hemisphere on Thursday, June 20, at 4:51 p.m. EDT.\n\nKnown as the summer solstice, the astronomical end of spring and start of summer, this will be the day with the longest period of sunlight (14 hours, 53 minutes, 42.5 seconds). It is the longest day of the year for us and marks the beginning of winter for the southern hemisphere.\n\nIf you watched the sun rise every day along the eastern horizon throughout the year, you would see it move daily. On the summer solstice, the sun has reached its farthest point northward on the horizon and its highest point in the sky at noon for your latitude. The very next day, the sun begins to move to the South along the horizon and lower in the sky at noon.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere June 20 marks the winter solstice, where the sun is at its lowest in the sky and farthest South on the eastern horizon and starts northward and higher each day.\n\nThe first full moon of summer, the full Strawberry Moon, occurs Friday at 9:08 p.m.\n\nWith the heat and humidity we are currently experiencing, I predict that it will be an impressively colored deep orange or reddish moonrise that will occur in the Southeast. Try to find a clear view of the horizon and/or a favorite landmark to watch the moon rise -- I don't think you will be disappointed! Take a picture too!\n\nThis Saturday make sure you get out and enjoy the Annual Astronomy Festival on the National Mall in D.C., which will be held from 6 to 11 p.m. on 7th and 9th streets in front of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.

Source: Created with the help of AI\n\nOn Thursday, June 20 this year, one of the main astronomical events takes place - the summer solstice. This is the day when the sun rises highest above the horizon and daylight hours are the longest. In all cultures, it is considered a magical date and an important holiday.\n\nDuring the solstice, it is believed that it is possible to attract good luck, love, wealth, health and other benefits into your life. OBOZ.UA tells how it was done in Ukraine and other countries. And what is customary to do now.\n\nHow the solstice is celebrated\n\nThe main symbol of the holiday in almost all cultures is a bonfire. Fire symbolizes the life-giving power of the sun and light. It is an element of the solar cult, which honors four main events: the two solstices - summer and winter, and the two equinoxes - spring and autumn.\n\nOn the longest day of the year, the peoples of the world celebrate some important holiday. For the Slavs, it was the Kupala holiday. It is the day when you can find a fern flower and thanks to it you can get extraordinary abilities - to see treasures in the ground, understand the language of animals, etc. It was also the day when young people looked for a mate. It was believed that if the relationship worked out, it would be happy and full of love, and the children born in this relationship would be healthy.\n\nAfter the advent of Christianity, Kupala merged in the popular consciousness with the church Christmas of John the Baptist. It still has the hybrid name of Ivan Kupala. Night has a special power during the celebration. No one should sleep at this time, but it is important to have fun and thank nature for its gifts.\n\nMagical rituals on the day of the solstice\n\nOne of the main rituals for our ancestors on this day was making a wreath. Flexible young tree branches, herbs, and flowers were woven into it. Together, they were supposed to give a person the power of nature, attract good luck and love.\n\nThe girls would tell fortunes on the wreaths and let them float on the water. The one whose wreath drowned or got stuck would have to be a virgin for another year. The boys stood downstream and caught the wreaths. Whichever one they pulled out was to become their mate for at least a holiday. Couples in love would try to leave each other some kind of sign, which one of the wreaths the boy should catch in order to be with his beloved.\n\nAnother important ritual was jumping over the Kupala fire. It was believed that anyone who jumped over it would be cleansed of sins and healed. People could jump in pairs. It was important not to break hands. This was to ensure a strong relationship between the couple.\n\nIt was also believed that on Kupala night, the night of the solstice, one should gather healing herbs. The longest day of the year was supposed to give them special powers. They were dried into decoctions and made into tinctures, which were then taken to cure ailments.\n\nModern esotericism, of course, has also developed its own rituals on the solstice. Here are some of them.\n\nCharging amulets with sunlight. You need to take an object that can serve as a talisman. Most often it is some kind of stone or crystal. You can take several objects. They are laid out on the sun so that they absorb as much solar energy as possible. At the same time, you can make a cherished wish. It is believed that such an amulet will charge its owner with positive energy throughout the year, protect him or her from trouble and help in the realization of the wish.\n\nThe ritual of visualizing a wish. At the moment of sunset, when the light from the sun becomes pleasing to the eyes, you need to look at the luminary and visualize your wish. You can ask the sun out loud to give you what you want. The main condition is that it should be positive, bring happiness, joy and prosperity.\n\nLighting candles. If you are unable to burn a fire all night, you can replace it with candles. Light one or more, meditate on the fire, think about good things and make a wish. You can write it down on a piece of paper and burn it on the flame of a candle. Do not forget to follow the fire safety rules!", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupala_Night", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kupala Night"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wreath", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wreath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bonfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artifact (archaeology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern_flower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fern flower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amulet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amulet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune-telling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortune-telling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Baptist", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John the Baptist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Christmas", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Christmas", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Floral", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Floral", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/6/20/image2023-06-2614-16-42.png?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 113, "textEnd": 120}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

It's the summer solstice, the longest day of the year north of the equator. When the summer solstice arrives at 3:50 this afternoon it will be the earliest in 224 years. The earth has a solstice every six months - in June, which has the most minutes of daylight, and in December, which has the fewest minutes of daylight. Thursday will show sunlight for over 14 hours.\n\nWhile the official start of summer is today, scientists say the solstice itself can happen any time between the 20th and the 22nd of June.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, however in the meteorological and climatological world, summer has already been in full swing for 20 days.\n\nSo why do meteorological and astronomical summer start on different days? In short, it's because the astronomical seasons are based on the position of the Earth in relation to the sun, whereas the meteorological seasons are based on the annual temperature cycle.\n\nPeople have used observable periodic natural phenomena to mark time for thousands of years. The natural rotation of the Earth around the sun forms the basis for the astronomical calendar, in which seasons are defined by two solstices and two equinoxes. Both the solstices and equinoxes are determined based on the Earth's tilt and the sun's alignment over the equator. The solstices mark the times when the sun's annual path is farthest, north or south, from the Earth's equator. The equinoxes mark the times when the sun passes directly above the equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice falls on or around June 21, the winter solstice on or around December 22, the vernal (spring) equinox on or around March 21, and the autumnal equinox on or around September 22. These seasons are reversed but begin on the same dates in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nBecause the Earth actually travels around the sun in 365.24 days, an extra day is needed every fourth year, creating what we know as Leap Year. This also causes the exact date of the solstices and equinoxes to vary. Additionally, the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit around the sun causes the lengths of the astronomical seasons to vary between 89 and 93 days. These variations in season length and season start would make it very difficult to consistently compare climatological statistics for a particular season from one year to the next. Thus, the meteorological seasons were born.\n\nMeteorologists and climatologists break the seasons down into groupings of three months based on the annual temperature cycle as well as our calendar. We generally think of winter as the coldest time of the year and summer as the warmest time of the year, with spring and fall being the transition seasons, and that is what the meteorological seasons are based on. Meteorological spring includes March, April, and May; meteorological summer includes June, July, and August; meteorological fall includes September, October, and November; and meteorological winter includes December, January, and February. These seasons were created for meteorological observing and forecasting purposes, and they are more closely tied to our monthly civil calendar than the astronomical seasons are. The length of the seasons is also more consistent for the meteorological seasons, ranging from 90 days for winter of a non-leap year to 92 days for spring and summer. By following the civil calendar and having less variation in season length and season start, it becomes much easier to calculate seasonal statistics from the monthly statistics, both of which are very useful for agriculture, commerce, and a variety of other purposes.", "source": {"uri": "ksal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsRadio 1150 KSAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "September equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth's rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leap year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Figure of the Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ellipse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars_and_Timekeeping", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars and Timekeeping", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.ksal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pool.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 544, "textEnd": 556}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 1598, "textEnd": 1605}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-22", "textStart": 1640, "textEnd": 1651}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-21", "textStart": 1694, "textEnd": 1702}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-22", "textStart": 1742, "textEnd": 1754}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

It brings the delight of long, sun-filled days and the freedom of school holidays. Yet, it also brings the challenge of enduring the intense heat, testing both physical and mental resilience.\n\nThis year, the summer is expected to be even more taxing, with temperatures already soaring in the weeks leading up to its official start. As the sun reaches its peak tonight, signalling the beginning of astronomical summer, Bahrainis gear up for a season that will push their endurance to the limit.\n\nRecent days have seen a significant rise in temperatures as Bahrain braces for the official start of summer, which begins today, Thursday, at 11:50 p.m. local time.\n\nYesterday's maximum temperature hit 46 degrees centigrade (114 F), exceeding the 45 degrees forecast by weather websites. The high temperatures were coupled with rising humidity, which surpassed 80% yesterday and is expected to climb further tomorrow, reaching over 85% along with a temperature of 44 degrees centigrade.\n\nTemperatures are predicted to continue rising in the coming days, with Sunday's high expected to reach 45 degrees centigrade.\n\nAstronomy researcher Mohammed Redha Al-Asfour explained that summer is the longest season of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, lasting 93 days, 15 hours, and 52 minutes. He noted that today marks the astronomical peak of summer in the Northern Hemisphere, featuring the longest day and shortest night of the year.\n\nDuring this period, daylight hours will start to gradually decrease, while in the Southern Hemisphere, this day marks the peak of winter, characterised by the shortest day and longest night. Night hours will also begin to gradually decrease.\n\nOn the first day of summer in Bahrain, the sun will rise at 4:45 a.m. from the farthest point of the northeast and set at 6:32 p.m. from the farthest point of the northwest. Midday will occur at exactly 11:39 a.m., marking the longest daylight period of 13 hours and 47 minutes and the shortest nighttime period of 10 hours and 13 minutes of the year.\n\nAl-Asfour highlighted that the first day of summer will witness the shortest shadow of the year as the sun reaches its zenith at noon, with its rays perpendicular to regions situated on the Tropic of Cancer.\n\nHe explained that the Earth's North Pole is inclined towards the sun, and owing to the Earth's axial tilt of 23.5 degrees, the sun's rays will be angled over areas situated on the Tropic of Capricorn, signifying the commencement of winter in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nWith the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, areas north of the Arctic Circle will experience 24 hours of sunlight daily, as the sun does not set there in a phenomenon known as the \"midnight sun.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Southern Hemisphere will witness the winter solstice, with some areas south of the Antarctic Circle experiencing a 24-hour night period as the sun remains unseen during this time of year, a phenomenon known as \"polar nights.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsofbahrain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DT News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antarctic Circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropic of Capricorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winter solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axial tilt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zenith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropic of Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midnight sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_night", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polar night"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arctic Circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Pole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.newsofbahrain.com/admin/post/upload/A_I6WpR5DMFB_2024-06-20_1718867218resized_pic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Even though the summer solstice happens every year, each year the energy in the skies is different than the previous. In order to capitalize on new summer beginnings, read on to find out what the summer solstice 2024 means for your zodiac sign.\n\nSolstices and equinoxes mark the start of the seasons. There are two solstices -- the summer solstice and winter solstice -- and two equinoxes -- the spring equinox and fall equinox -- every year. While the change of the seasons might feel like a regular phenomenon to you, if we tap into the astrology behind each one, each season is imbued with unique astrological markings that can help us prepare for the next season ahead.\n\nAs we leave the season of the spring equinox (and Aries season) -- which, in astrological terms, is the start of the \"New Year\" -- we enter the second season: the summer solstice. This period is marked by the moment the sun enters Cancer, on June 20 at 4:51 p.m. ET. Of course, this brings a completely different vibe than the spring equinox -- colored with Aries fire and intention. Being one of the more emotional cardinal signs, Cancer energy gives us the courage to feel our feelings, love without abandon, and embrace the comfort side of life.\n\nThe summer solstice is also the longest day of the year, which means that every day subsequent to June 20 will have longer and longer nights. This will bring Cancer season closer to Cancer's ruling planet -- the moon.\n\nThere are a few key moments happening during this solstice that will form its particular astrological makeup. On this day, right before the sun moves into Cancer, this planet will make a square to Neptune -- which guides our mindset into a world of fantasy and creativity. Just a few days prior, Mercury and Venus aligned and also made a square to Neptune. This sets the stage for a super dreamy summer setting, wherein we can find ourselves getting lost in family and summer days (sun), creativity and intuition (Mercury), and falling in love (Venus).\n\nRead below to see how the 2024 summer solstice will affect your zodiac sign. Make sure to read for both your sun sign and rising sign!\n\nThe summer solstice and all its dreamy energy is happening in your home and family house. This is a great time to host parties at home and gather your family around (either immediate or friend family). It's also a moment where you might reflect on how grateful you are to live where you do, or you might start daydreaming about places you would rather live. This is definitely the right moment to dream up the possibilities. Hold off on making any rash purchases. Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nThis tranquil season is falling under your communication house. Not only will your words become super sweet and loving (making it very easy to quell any arguments), but your mindset will shift toward speaking from the heart, to the heart. On a practical level, this is perfect for Taureans in sales, as you're able to reach people's core desires to make an emotional sale. But overall, sentimentality is huge right now. And with Mercury and Venus being activated -- particularly in the chatterbox house -- nostalgia and talking about the past is activated. Read your full monthly June horoscope here.\n\nThe summer season isn't the best time to be at work anyhow. This solstice and all that Cancer energy is happening in your house of earned income and personal assets. Cancer is watery, slippery, and non-direct. So, those \"direct deposits\" might get caught in a loop or may not feel so streamlined right now. That's especially true with the square to Neptune happening from your career house. Honestly, work won't feel all that important anyway. Spend your money on summer delights, rather than letting it pass by behind your office windows. Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nAh, what a great time to be a Cancer! With the planets of communication and love aligning, and also making that square to Neptune, the world is providing you with the opportunity to be your authentic, loving self. Share your feelings. Fall in love. Cuddle. Hug your friends. Spend quality time with family. Send cards and mushy texts. These are things you do anyway, but during this moment in time, the astrology is setting up the stage for your affections to be received well from those you give it too. Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nThis summer solstice, amidst all the possibilities for fantasy, is a great season for you. If it were placed in a more \"center stage\" house, you would be using this for things like performing or role playing. But since it's happening in your house of solitude and escapism, this could encourage you to really dive into the world of art. Go to art shows, see Midsummer Night's Dream live, watch a really great movie. Enjoy the escape! Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nFriendships and community is going to be important around this time, Virgo. Honestly, this is the perfect setting for a good-natured community summer gathering. Think: neighborhood block party, HOA get together, office potlucks, backyard BBQs with all the friends. Whatever you do to bring some community of yours together will automatically strengthen the bond. Use Cancer's \"homey\" energy to help you create a more connected or loving environment for that particular group. Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nAll of this fantasy action is happening in your house of publicity and career, Libra. You're probably thinking... fantasy and career, how does that work? Really, this gives you the opportunity to dream big in terms of what you want to do with your life. Anything is possible! Allow yourself to call in the best job, the most followers, the biggest sales year, any awards or accolades you've been seeking. The more you imagine, the more you manifest. Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nHappening in your house of travel and higher education, the fantasy behind this summer solstice isn't really conducive to travel plans that have a detailed schedule or practical element. So, those tickets to Fiji that you're about to buy, you might want to wait until the energy is a little more stable. But a spontaneous summer road trip? A trip to the lake? A long day at the beach? That's the perfect use of this lighthearted and watery season. Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nWhen we think of love (Cancer season) mixing with Neptune's fantastical vibes -- all in the house of sex, taboo, and dark depths -- this is an ideal time to get imaginative in the bedroom. Think: role play, BDSM, porn, sensual erotica. Get saucy with it! See where it takes you. Even if you don't continue these bedtime rituals after this season, the openness of Cancer's sexuality is definitely helpful to try new things, or at the very least, get the conversation going. Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nThis is love's finest opportunity, Capricorn! All this energy is happening in your house of love and partnership. While you're not the most romantic, Cancer season always tends to help you break from your desk and invest a little more into your love life. And thanks to both the summer solstice and Neptune's dreamy landscape, you're not only going to be more open to love... you may even get lost in it -- which is an entirely new thing for you. Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nOkay, Aquarius, the summer solstice is lighting up your house of daily duties, routine, and health. One might consider this house a bit \"boring\". It's grocery store trips, dieting, the way you take your coffee in the morning. It's the everyday things you do. But with the summer solstice hitting here, alongside Neptune's fantasy, suddenly these routines might change more to reflect what warms your heart rather than what feels most practical. Read your full June monthly horoscope here.\n\nAll of this energy is hitting your house of friendships, dating, and inner circles. Given Cancer's cuddly nature, and Neptune's delusion, there are two ways this could go: 1) You use this time to get closer to the ones who are important to you (and maybe even fall in love), or 2) You lose sight of the bigger picture and forget to keep your feet on the ground and head out of the clouds.

Summer's hottest days are still weeks away.\n\nThis year's summer solstice arrives as a dangerous heat wave affects millions across the country, with early-season extreme heat impacting parts of the Midwest and Northeast.\n\nBut the longest day of the year - which begins Thursday at 4:51 p.m. ET - is not typically associated with the hottest temperatures of the season in the U.S. The most scorching conditions typically occur much later in the summer, records show, with different regions of the country experiencing their warmest average temperatures at varying times. Brutal summer heat, however, will increase in frequency and duration for much of the country over the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe summer solstice marks the beginning of astronomical summer in the Northern Hemisphere, according to NASA. Astronomical seasons are determined by the Earth's tilt on its rotational axis and its orbit around the sun and do not take into account temperature data, which is what determines meteorological seasons.\n\nSolstices occur when the planet's tilt is most pronounced. The summer solstice occurs when Earth's tilt toward the sun is at a maximum, bringing the longest day of the year.\n\nOn the first day of astronomical summer, the sun is at its highest point in the sky and so delivers the most direct solar radiation to the hemisphere experiencing the summer season. However, it takes time for that solar radiation to begin warming the Earth's atmosphere and surface, especially the oceans.\n\nThis time difference creates a lag between the first day of summer and when the Earth experiences the hottest temperatures of the year.\n\nFor the contiguous U.S., records show July is the hottest month of the year, on average, with the majority of the country - including much of the Northeast, Midwest, and West - experiencing the hottest temperatures of the year during the second half of July and first half of August. However, some regions of the country don't typically experience their warmest average temperatures until August, or even September.\n\nMuch of the South typically experiences its peak average temperatures during the second half of August, while for some regions of the West Coast, the warmest temperatures of the year usually don't occur until September.\n\nFor this summer, overall above-average temperatures are forecast across much of the country, with several significant heat waves likely for parts of the Northeast and Southwest.\n\nEarth has experienced 12 months of record high temperatures, according to reports published earlier this month by the World Meteorological Organization and Copernicus, Europe's climate change service.\n\nThe record-breaking trend is expected to continue through June and could potentially last through the rest of the summer, forecasts show.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar irradiance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicolaus Copernicus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Meteorological Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Europe", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Advisory Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1f13b72a-3678-4dbe-8c86-c8d93588785d/usa-heat-01-gty-jef-240619_1718803905698_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

And it is welcomed as a spiritual moment for many.\n\nAncient monument Stonehenge - covered by powder paint by Just Stop Oil activists on Wednesday - is famously the place to be for the solstice sunrise and crowds will be gathering again this evening and into Friday morning. But the North East, we could argue, has the next best thing when it comes to atmospheric locations to celebrate the longest day of the year.\n\nRead more: Why does the moon have so many different names? The answer will intrigue you\n\nGet all the latest North East updates with our free What's On newsletter\n\nWith its miles of beaches, rolling countryside and dramatic castles, it offers plenty magical settings in which to take in the solstice sunrise and its sunset. After such a poor summer so far, many across the region were treated to evening sunshine followed by spectacular skies on Wednesday night.\n\nSo, it will be fingers crossed for more of the same this Thursday. Here is a top pick of North East locations where people might enjoy the solstice sunset at its best.\n\nHadrian's Wall\n\nThe Roman Wall in Northumberland has coast-to-coast opportunities to take in those sunset skies and it also conjures up an aura of peace and calm, away from hectic city life. Other local spots such as Steel Rigg offer elevated views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nWhitley Bay and Tynemouth\n\nThe whole North East coast, with its long stretch of beaches, provide plenty space and open vistas to enjoy the night-time skies. Following recent stunning images of the northern lights, seen at their best around Whitley Bay, crowds gathered on the North Tyneside coast again to watch the solstice sunrise this morning and similar scenes are expected this evening.\n\nNewcastle Keep\n\nYou don't have to escape the city to enjoy great sunset views. Business improvement district company NE1 suggests people mark the astronomically significant date in the heart of the city - and the top of the Castle Keep could be the ideal spot for those views. The historic castle is set to host two early evening tours culminating in a chance to step out onto the rooftop to enjoy the sights: check here for availability. Remember, the city also has a Solstice restaurant - a Kenny Atkinson Michelin star winner - to check out too.\n\nRural Durham\n\nTourist site This Is Durham is highlighting the regions' range of attractions for the summer solstice, from countryside and heather moorlands to its wildlife. There's a Nature & Wildlife Calendar featuring ideas for where to explore the great out doors - see here.\n\nThere's also an upcoming Summer Solstice Vegan Retreat & Eco-Festival Celebration Weekend set to take place at Dalton Moor Farm at Seaham, starting with a Full Moon Fire Circle on Friday evening which needs to be booked separately. Find out more here.\n\nSeaburn and Roker\n\nThe Sunderland coast offers its own opportunities to watch the vast sky and sea merge as one come sunset. As in many areas, a special event - a Summer Solstice Gathering - is advertised on Seaburn beach which will see people gather for socialising and meditation into the early hours of the morning. This one is showing up as fully booked but of course there's nothing to stop people packing up some food and drink and picking their own coastal spot to enjoy a sunset social.", "source": {"uri":

On this day, the sun appears to stand still as it makes its appearance farthest north from the equator and starting Friday it will ever so slowly begin moving south again.\n\nThe first day of summer is neither the earliest sunset or the latest sunrise. The earliest sunset was roughly a week ago and the latest sunset of the year is still five days away. Today is, however, the day with the greatest amount of daylight, or largest gap between sunrise and sunset at 15 hours 17 minutes and 12 seconds in Boston. There is more light to the north and less to the south.\n\nThe reason why it's the earliest summer solstice since 1796 is because 2024 is a leap year and because of the imperfect nature of our calendars. A year is never exactly 365 days long, according to TimeandDate.com, because the Earth actually takes longer to orbit the sun, more like 365.24 days, to be exact.\n\n\"Although a common year has 365 days in today's Gregorian calendar, we add a leap day nearly every four years to stay in sync with the tropical year\" (also known as a \"solar year,\" 365.24 days long), the experts at TimeandDate say.\n\nAlthough there is the most amount of light today, it's not the average warmest day of the year. That holds off until the third week of July because of something called \"seasonal lag.\" Seasonal lag occurs because the Earth is mostly water and that takes longer to heat up than the land.\n\nOver the next month, here in our spot in the Northern Hemisphere we will still be gaining more energy than is lost and the air temperature will go higher. As the angle of the sun and the amount of daylight continues to decrease in August, the average temperature will respond. This doesn't mean that the hottest summer temperature doesn't occur in the May-through-September timeframe. Indeed, the 98-degree high temperature yesterday (June 19) has a very good chance of being the hottest reading of the entire year.\n\nLooking ahead, we have the autumnal equinox on the morning of Sept. 22. This will mark the end of astronomical summer, although by then the kids will have been back in school for three weeks, morning lows are likely to be back at more comfortable levels and most, if not all, of the 90-degree days of the year will have already occurred.\n\nEach season brings its own unique weather and opportunity to appreciate this part of the world we live in and all the changes our spinning tilted planet affords each of us.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leap year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seasonal lag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer solstice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "September equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars_and_Timekeeping", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars and Timekeeping", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Academic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/HzsRkaTtmiJ-VGLFaRrpr6he3pQ=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/5APX6YAVQIH2QFQ4U7WQSFERDE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666052", "eventUri": "eng-9666052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 1936, "textEnd": 1943}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-22", "textStart": 2080, "textEnd": 2088}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

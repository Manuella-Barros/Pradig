newsreader remain under review, it is understood.\n\nThe Academy is reviewing seven individual presenter prizes handed to Edwards by the Bafta Cymru Awards between 2002 to 2017.\n\nA Bafta spokesperson said: \"Like everyone in the industry and country we were shocked by the news - given the seriousness of this abhorrent crime, we are reviewing.\"\n\nThe Bafta won by the BBC in 2012 for Edwards' coverage of Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding in 2011, will remain.\n\nThe state funeral of the late Queen Elizabeth II also won two Baftas for sound: factual and in the director: multi-camera category last year.\n\nThe coverage featured commentary from presenters including Edwards as well as David Dimbleby - who came out of retirement for the event.\n\nEdwards has won the best on-screen presenter prize at the Bafta Cymru awards numerous times over the years, the first being in 2002 for his Election Exchange show and he retained the prize the following year for The Exchange.\n\nHe also won it in 2004 for his programme The Story Of Welsh, in 2005 for his docuseries Bread Of Heaven and in 2010 for The Prince And The Plotter.\n\nLater in 2013, he picked up the best prize prize of his The Story Of Wales programme and he took home the same gong in 2017 for Aberfan - The Fight For Justice.\n\nThe Bafta Cymru presenter awards are peer voted for, while the honorary special awards are gifted by the Bafta board of trustees - Edwards has not received a special award in his career.\n\nThe veteran broadcaster admitted having indecent images of children last week, with seven of the 41 images being of the most serious type.\n\nBBC director general Tim Davie later defended his decision to employ Edwards until April, five months after he was told of Edwards' arrest in November over the most serious category of indecent images of children.\n\nEdwards resigned from the BBC in April \"on the basis of medical advice from his doctors\" after unrelated allegations that he paid a young person for sexually explicit photos.\n\nPolice found no evidence of criminal behaviour in the matter.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news",

It has been removed from iPlayer.\n\nIn the 2006 episode Fear Her, his voice was heard as a news commentator and it's been claimed BBC bosses will replace it with an actor's.\n\nA source told the Mirror: 'It's going to be hard for the BBC to airbrush Huw out of the news events he covered, but the Doctor Who episode should be straightforward.'\n\nIt has yet to be confirmed what will be happening to other footage and news coverage Edwards fronted, as well as an appearance on Would I Lie To You and a Christmas duet with Sir Tom Jones in 2013.\n\nOne insider told The Times, according to MailOnline: 'The bulletins will be full of archive footage of him which is obviously awkward.\n\n'There will have to be discussions about the archive but no-one was expecting him to plead guilty today, so that key issue is not one that has been solved yet.'\n\nIn a statement, following Edwards pleading guilty, the BBC said: 'In November 2023, whilst Mr Edwards was suspended, the BBC as his employer at the time was made aware in confidence that he had been arrested on suspicion of serious offences and released on bail whilst the police continued their investigation.\n\n'At the time, no charges had been brought against Mr Edwards and the BBC had also been made aware of significant risk to his health.'\n\nThe corporation added: 'The BBC is shocked to hear the details which have emerged in court today. There can be no place for such abhorrent behaviour and our thoughts are with all those affected.\n\n'Today we have learnt of the conclusion of the police process in the details as presented to the court.\n\n'If at any point during the period Mr Edwards was employed by the BBC he had been charged, the BBC had determined it would act immediately to dismiss him. In the end, at the point of charge he was no longer an employee of the BBC.\n\n'During this period, in the usual way, the BBC has kept its corporate management of these issues separate from its independent editorial functions.'\n\nLast month in a London court, Edwards pleaded guilty to three offences of making indecent images of children between December 2020 and April 2021.\n\nThe child abuse materials that were sent to Edwards by 25-year-old convicted paedophile Alex Williams included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, the court was told.\n\nHis guilty plea came after a year of headlines about Edwards, which started when he was named as the presenter at the centre of a scandal over payments to a young person for sexually explicit images.\n\nBefore Edwards resigned on medical advice in April, he was the broadcaster's highest-paid newsreader, with a pay bracket between \u00a3475,000 and \u00a3479,999 for the year 2023/24, according to the BBC's latest annual report.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted RTS, Tric and Bafta for comment.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : The 'problem' BBC could face deleting historic Huw Edwards TV footage", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_lawes@metro.co.uk", "name": "Ruth Lawes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Television_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Television Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Academy of Film and Television Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_and_Radio_Industries_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Television and Radio Industries Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Elizabeth_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Cymru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BAFTA Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Would_I_Lie_to_You?_(game_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Would I Lie to You?

It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat.\n\n\"Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else, and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nEdwards will be sentenced at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 16th September, where he faces possible jail time.", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katelyn_mensah@radiotimes.com", "name": "Katelyn Mensah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_and_Radio_Industries_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Television and Radio Industries Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Television_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Television Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Academy of Film and Television Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Cymru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BAFTA Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "B movie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Personalized", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Personalized", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/08/huw-edwards-feb0a4f.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798699", "eventUri": "eng-9798699", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1067, "textEnd": 1076}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-16", "textStart": 2508, "textEnd": 2522}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 1493, "textEnd": 1506}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Among his awards were a Bafta, the Royal Television Society (RTS), and the Television and Radio Industries Club (Tric). However, some of the organisations have now decided against rescinding his awards, much to the annoyance of online users.\n\nIt was reported the organisations awarded the presenter alongside the production team rather than just him. Many viewers didn't take kindly to the reports and let their feelings known on Twitter/X. One user fumed: \"Of course he will,\" alongside a rolling eyes emoji when replying to the news. Another wrote: \"Ridiculous and he should be jailed.\"\n\nAccording to Deadline, it's yet to be confirmed whether Bafta will remove his seven individual accolades from its its Welsh Bafta Cymru Awards. The Mirror has contacted the organisation who previously told Metro: \"Like everyone in the industry and country we were shocked by the news - given the seriousness of this abhorrent crime, we are reviewing.\"\n\nWhile Edwards never received an individual gong from RTS, the BBC won a Live Event award for the Queen's Funeral, which it will keep, the organisation told the publication. \"Our Live Event category for the RTS Programme Awards is presented to a programme as a whole and the team behind it. We are therefore not reviewing or rescinding this award from 2023,\" a spokesperson for RTS said.\n\nThe newsreader pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children last week, and it was later revealed that he had been arrested over serious allegations in November, 2023. This ignited a wave of backlash against Director-General Tim Davie - which the BBC had been made aware of at the time.\n\nNow, staff members at BBC have blasted \"flaccid\" bosses as they continue to demand retribution for failing to sack Edwards immediately following his arrest. A source said it \"impossible to overstate the rage\" felt by employees.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, employees were stunned he remained on the payroll for five months despite his arrest, before leaving his BBC News At Ten hosting duties. The publication cited sources who said it was an \"indefensible\" offence, particularly as Huw Edwards earned \u00a3200k of his bumper salary.\n\n\"It's always the same few men being protected but if an ordinary member of staff ran into half the trouble Huw did, they'd be toast,\" another unnamed BBC presenter argued. \"And flaccid BBC management yet again aren't on the front foot.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_roberts@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jamie Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Television_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Television Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British Academy of Film and Television Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Elizabeth_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_and_Radio_Industries_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television and Radio Industries Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Cymru", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BAFTA Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Davie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Davie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director-General_of_the_BBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director-General of the BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors_and_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors and Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33416585.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Royal-Television-Society-Programme-Awards-2023-VIP-Arrivals.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798699", "eventUri": "eng-9798699", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He will be sentenced in September.\n\nA scathing statement issued by the BBC board read: \"There is nothing more important than the public's trust in the BBC; the BBC Board is the custodian of that trust.\n\n\"The Board has met a number of times over the last week to review information provided by the Executive relating to Huw Edwards. The Board's focus has been principally around two issues. Firstly, what was known in the lead up to Mr Edwards being charged and pleading guilty last Wednesday to making indecent images of children; and, secondly, the specifics of the BBC's handling of the complaints and the BBC's own investigations into Mr Edwards, prior to his resignation on 22 April 2024.\n\n\"The Board has reviewed the details provided with regard to both series of events. On these, the Board supports the decisions taken by the Director-General and his team during this period. These decisions were based on taking into account a range of factors including: the BBC's legal and contractual obligations; the knowledge the BBC had at the time; duty of care concerns; and, due regard for the accountability that the BBC has for public money. The Executive has agreed to look at lessons from this period, including the BBC's approach to the rules surrounding payments when employees are suspended.\n\n\"Today, the Board has authorised the Executive to seek the return of salary paid to Mr Edwards from the time he was arrested in November last year. Mr Edwards pleaded guilty to an appalling crime. Had he been up front when asked by the BBC about his arrest, we would never have continued to pay him public money. He has clearly undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute.\n\n\"Whilst the nature of the charges against Mr Edwards is related to his own personal life, the Board believes these events have also put a spotlight on the question of power imbalances in the workplace. We remain concerned about the potential for inappropriate workplace behaviour, particularly in creative and editorial environments. Whilst challenges related to power imbalances in the workplace are a challenge for multiple employers, the BBC must hold itself to the highest standards.\"\n\nIt continued: \"The BBC has clearly articulated Values and a strong Code of Conduct and there has been much progress in recent years. That said, the Board will commission an independent review that will make recommendations on practical steps that could strengthen a workplace culture in line with BBC Values.

The Board's focus has been principally around two issues. Firstly, what was known in the lead up to Mr Edwards being charged and pleading guilty last Wednesday to making indecent images of children; and, secondly, the specifics of the BBC's handling of the complaints and the BBC's own investigations into Mr Edwards, prior to his resignation on 22 April 2024.\n\n\"The Board has reviewed the details provided with regard to both series of events. On these, the Board supports the decisions taken by the Director-General and his team during this period. These decisions were based on taking into account a range of factors including: the BBC's legal and contractual obligations; the knowledge the BBC had at the time; duty of care concerns; and, due regard for the accountability that the BBC has for public money. The Executive has agreed to look at lessons from this period, including the BBC's approach to the rules surrounding payments when employees are suspended.\n\n\"Today, the Board has authorised the Executive to seek the return of salary paid to Mr Edwards from the time he was arrested in November last year. Mr Edwards pleaded guilty to an appalling crime. Had he been up front when asked by the BBC about his arrest, we would never have continued to pay him public money. He has clearly undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute.\n\n\"Whilst the nature of the charges against Mr Edwards is related to his own personal life, the Board believes these events have also put a spotlight on the question of power imbalances in the workplace. We remain concerned about the potential for inappropriate workplace behaviour, particularly in creative and editorial environments. Whilst challenges related to power imbalances in the workplace are a challenge for multiple employers, the BBC must hold itself to the highest standards.\n\n\"The BBC has clearly articulated Values and a strong Code of Conduct and there has been much progress in recent years. That said, the Board will commission an independent review that will make recommendations on practical steps that could strengthen a workplace culture in line with BBC Values. The review will include work already being undertaken within the BBC, as well as working with the rest of the industry as appropriate. We will set out terms of reference and leadership of this review in early September.\n\n\"The review will report to the Board within months, and will be published.\"\n\n* This is a breaking showbiz news story.

the knowledge the BBC had at the time; duty of care concerns; and, due regard for the accountability that the BBC has for public money.\n\n\"The Executive has agreed to look at lessons from this period, including the BBC's approach to the rules surrounding payments when employees are suspended.\n\n\"Today, the Board has authorised the Executive to seek the return of salary paid to Mr Edwards from the time he was arrested in November last year.\n\n\"Mr Edwards pleaded guilty to an appalling crime.\n\n\"Had he been up front when asked by the BBC about his arrest, we would never have continued to pay him public money.\n\n\"He has clearly undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute.\n\n\"Whilst the nature of the charges against Mr Edwards is related to his own personal life, the Board believes these events have also put a spotlight on the question of power imbalances in the workplace.\n\n\"We remain concerned about the potential for inappropriate workplace behaviour, particularly in creative and editorial environments.\n\n\"Whilst challenges related to power imbalances in the workplace are a challenge for multiple employers, the BBC must hold itself to the highest standards.\n\n\"The BBC has clearly articulated Values and a strong Code of Conduct and there has been much progress in recent years.\n\n\"That said, the Board will commission an independent review that will make recommendations on practical steps that could strengthen a workplace culture in line with BBC Values.\n\n\"The review will include work already being undertaken within the BBC, as well as working with the rest of the industry as appropriate.\n\n\"We will set out terms of reference and leadership of this review in early September.\n\n\"The review will report to the Board within months, and will be published.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_goodwin@thesun.ie", "name": "Harry Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director-General_of_the_BBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director-General of the BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/newspress-collage-ctyngmxp7-1723201544577.jpg?1723205297&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798699", "eventUri": "eng-9798699", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

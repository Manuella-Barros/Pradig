Canada alleges Indian agents involved. Three Indians arrested\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) reiterated on Thursday that India has not received any \"specific or relevant evidence\" from Canada regarding the killing of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, for which three Indian nationals have been arrested.\n\nNijjar, who was designated as a terrorist by India, was killed in Surrey last June. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed in September that Indian government agents were involved in Nijjar's shooting. However, India strongly rejected these allegations and asked Canada to furnish proof. It also urged Ottawa to take measures to curb the increasing anti-Indian activities of Khalistani groups operating in the country with immunity.\n\n\"Let me first make it clear that no specific or relevant evidence or information has been shared by the Canadian authorities till date. You will therefore understand our view that the matter is being pre-judged. Obviously, there are political interests at work.

We have also pointed to the Canadian authorities that figures associated with organized crime with links with India have been allowed entry and residency in Canada.

Our job is to protect Canadians and we stand by the allegations that a Canadian was killed on Canadian soil by Indian agents,\" Joly told the media on Tuesday.\n\nJoly's statement follows Canada's arrest of three Indian nationals, accused of being part of an alleged hit squad responsible for Nijjar's murder in British Columbia last year. Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22, all Indian nationals, face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The Canadian foreign minister further said that the investigation into Nijjar's killing is being conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistani_groups", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalistani groups"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Permanent residency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9lanie_Joly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9lanie Joly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/hardeep-singh-nijjars-killers-combo-2024-05-086a85b2f00e649181e436012c252053-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553309", "eventUri": "eng-9553309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

To a poser on whether consular access had been granted, Mr Jaiswal only said that, in some countries, access is not given until the person or people who have been arrested specifically request for it.\n\nDiplomatic ties between India and Canada have remained tense since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed in the country's Parliament in September last year that his government had \"credible allegations\" linking the killing of Nijjar in June 2023 with the \"agents of the Government of India\".\n\nAsked whether India had been given any evidence of involvement in the killing, Mr Jaiswal reiterated the country's consistent stand.\n\nMincing no words, he said, \"Let me first make it clear that no specific or relevant evidence or information has been shared by the Canadian authorities in regard to this matter till date.

photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist, Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nAlong with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP had said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia

Last Friday, Canadian police announced the arrest and charging of the three Indians - Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karan Brar, both 22 - for the murder of Nijjar and said they were probing whether the men had ties to the Indian government, as reported by Hindustan Times.\n\nCanada Detains Trio for Khalistan Activist Nijjar's Murder Amid Diplomatic Tensions\n\n\"Canada has informed us about the arrests...We have been informed that three people have been arrested, and they happen to be Indian nationals,\" stated Jaiswal in response to questions.

India's high commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Verma, stated at an event held at the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations on May 7 that the two countries are using diplomatic channels \"not open to the public\" to try and find solutions to issues of concern to both sides, as reported by Hindustan Times.\n\nVerma highlighted that national security threats emanating from Canada and the pro-Khalistan activities of Canadian citizens are the \"two red lines\" for India. This is perhaps the first time that the Indian side has acknowledged these discussions. However, bilateral ties continue to be at an all-time low.\n\nNew Zealand Deputy PM Questions Evidence Of India Link In Nijjar Killing\n\nThe Canadian deputy high commissioner was summoned to the external affairs ministry last month for a protest over pro-Khalistan slogans being raised at an event in Toronto that was attended by Trudeau.

The three had reportedly entered Canada on student visas.\n\nThe three men face first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the Nijjar case.\n\nThe MEA spokesperson's statement comes as India on Tuesday hit out at Canada for providing a \"safe haven\" and political space to criminal and \"secessionist\" elements, after pro-Khalistan elements shouted anti-India slogans and displayed anti-India graffiti and posters at a religious parade in Ontario's Malton area.\n\nIn Tuesday's statement, India said that \"Celebration and glorification of violence should not be a part of any civilized society. Democratic countries which respect the rule of law should not allow intimidation by radical elements in the name of freedom of expression\", referring to the pandering of Khalistani elements by Canada.\n\nOn May 4, during an interaction with journalists in Odisha, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that Canada has been welcoming a number of gangland people with organised crime links from Punjab and ignoring Indian warnings against giving them visa, and therefore killings like that of separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar is an issue that Ottawa has to worry about.\n\nAsked about the arrest of three Indian nationals with regard to the killing of Khalistani separatist Nijjar in British Columbia last year, EAM Jaishankar said he had seen the report about the arrests: \"I also saw this report; okay somebody may have been arrested, their police may have done some investigation, but the fact is the number of gangland people, the number of people with organised crime links from Punjab, have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada that these are wanted criminals from India, you are giving them visa; many have come on false documentation, and yet you allow them to live there. If you decide to import people with negative backgrounds there will be issues. \"\n\nJaishankar also said that the Khalistani elements have organised themselves politically in Canada and become a political lobby.\n\n\"And in some of these democratic countries the politicians of those countries are made to believe that if they defer to these people or pander to these people, these people have some ability to get the community to support them,\" he said, in reference to Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, who has taken the support of NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who is a Khalistan sympathiser. Canada is known to have the second highest Sikh population in the world, after India, at over 770,000, or about two % of its total population.\n\nEAM said these separatist elements \"have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries\".\n\n\"At this time, I would say it is not so much of a problem in the US; our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, the party in power in Canada, other parties in Canada, have given these kinds of extremism, separatism and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy, in the name of free speech.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller denied External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's statement that Ottawa has been ignoring Indian warnings and welcoming a number of gangland people with organised crime links from Punjab into the country.\n\nAsked by journalists if the Justin Trudeau government has been lax about who it lets into the country as the EAM has said, Miller said: \"We are not lax and the Indian foreign minister is entitled to his opinion.\"\n\nAsked again, he said:\n\n\"Let him speak his mind, it is just not accurate.\"\n\nAsked if the three Indians arrested in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar were in Canada on student visas, he refused to confirm.\n\n\"I can't (confirm). This is information I can't share with you at this time. It is an ongoing police investigation. The questions lie properly with the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police),\" Miller said.\n\nUNI RN", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_News_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United News of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Permanent residency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Indian_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Indian sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

Canada has informed us about the arrest. But we have not got any formal communication...,\" MEA Spokesperson said on three Indians arrested in Canada in Nijjar killing.\n\n\"Therefore, understand a view that the matter is being prejudged when people say x or y. Obviously, there are political interests at work. We have long maintained that separatists, extremists and those advocating violence have been given political space in Canada,\" he said in a press briefing on Thursday.\n\n\"Our diplomats have been threatened with impunity and obstructed in their performance of duties. We have also pointed out to the Canadian authorities that figures associated with organised crimes with links in India have been allowed entry and residency. Many extradition requests are pending with them. We are having discussions at the diplomatic levels on all these matters with the Canadian side,\" he added.\n\nOn being asked if India has given consular access to the three Indians arrested in Nijjar Killing case, MEA spokesperson said that they have not received any request from the Canadian side for the same as those arrested have not asked for the consular access yet.\n\n\"In different countries, there are different norms. In certain countries, if a person of a certain country is apprehended, then it is for that national to make a request that please give consular access to my embassy and there after it is granted,\" he said.\n\nThe three men were taken into custody in Edmonton last week on Friday and are accused of first-degree murder and murderous conspiracy in connection with the June 2023 shooting of Nijjar, which severely damaged Canada's relations with India.\n\nNotably, ties between India and Canada have been strained after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused agents of the Indian government of killing Nijjar. However, India has dismissed the accusations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\".\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. The video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing.\"\n\nLast week, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist, Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nAlong with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP had said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Nijjar.

India has dismissed the accusation as \"absurd\" and maintained that Canada has shared no evidence to back up the allegation.\n\nAlso Read: Two of the three Indian suspects in Nijjar's killing came to Canada as students\n\nLast Friday, Canadian police announced the arrest and charging of the three Indians - Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar, both 22 - for the murder of Nijjar and said they were probing whether the men had ties to the Indian government.\n\n\"Canada has informed us about the arrests...We have been informed that three people have been arrested, and they happen to be Indian nationals,\" Jaiswal said in response to questions. He added that \"no formal communication\" on the matter had reached the Indian side.\n\n\"Let me first make it clear that no specific or relevant evidence or information has been shared by the Canadian authorities till date. You will, therefore, understand our view that the matter is being pre-judged,\" he said.\n\nPointing out that \"political interests\" are at work, Jaiswal said India has maintained that \"separatists, extremists, and those advocating violence have been given political space in Canada\".\n\nIndian diplomats have been threatened with impunity and obstructed from performing their duties, and the Indian side has informed Canadian authorities that figures associated with organised crime and with links to India have been \"allowed entry and residency in Canada\".\n\nJaiswal also said many of India's extradition requests are pending. At the same time, he acknowledged the two countries are having discussions at the diplomatic level on all these matters.\n\nIndia's high commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Verma, too had said at an event held at the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations on May 7 that the two countries are using diplomatic channels \"not open to the public\" to try and find solutions to issues of concern to both sides. Verma also said national security threats emanating from Canada and the pro-Khalistan activities of Canadian citizens are the \"two red lines\" for India.\n\nThis is perhaps the first time that the Indian side has acknowledged these discussions. However, bilateral ties continue to be at an all-time low. The Canadian deputy high commissioner was summoned to the external affairs ministry last month for a protest over pro-Khalistan slogans being raised at an event in Toronto that was attended by Trudeau. New Delhi also reacted strongly to a Khalsa Day parade at Malton on May 5 that depicted the Indian premier in chains and within a cage.\n\nAsked specifically about the possibility of India getting consular access to the three Indians arrested in Canada, Jaiswal said this would depend on the norms for such access.

Addressing a presser, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, \"No specific or relevant evidence or information has been shared by the Canadian authorities to date. You will therefore understand our view that the matter is being pre-judged. Obviously, there are political interests at work.\"\n\nJaiswal also expressed concern and alleged that Canada was providing political space to separatists, extremists, and advocates of violence. He further claimed that Indian diplomats faced threats with impunity in Canada and encountered obstacles while carrying out their diplomatic duties.\n\n\"We have also pointed to the Canadian authorities that figures associated with organised crime with links to India have been allowed entry and residency in Canada. Many of our extradition requests are pending. We are having discussions at the diplomatic level on all these matters,\" the MEA spokesperson said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, three Indian nationals accused of killing Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year appeared before a Canadian court through video for the first time to face homicide charges in a case that has soured Canada-India relations. Karan Brar, 22, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karanpreet Singh, 28, all Indian nationals residing in Edmonton, were arrested and charged on Friday with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThey appeared separately by video in front of a packed Surrey provincial courtroom on Tuesday to acknowledge the charges of first-degree murder and conspiring to commit murder and to agree to have their cases adjourned to May 21 to give them time to consult with their lawyers, the Vancouver Sun newspaper reported.\n\nThe three - believed to be connected to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang - appeared before the Surrey Provincial Court in British Columbia province, the report said.\n\nEach of them appeared separately from North Fraser Pretrial Centre wearing jail-issued red T-shirts or sweatshirts and sweatpants.\n\nTwo of the accused appeared in the morning while Kamalpreet Singh's appearance was delayed until after lunch to give him time to consult with a lawyer.\n\nAll three agreed to have the proceedings heard in English and each of them nodded that they understood the charges of first-degree murder and conspiring to murder Nijjar, the report said.\n\nThe court granted the Crown prosecutor's request for a no-contact order naming seven people under a Canada Criminal Code section that bans the accused from communicating directly or indirectly with any of them.\n\nThose named on the order are Nijjar's son Balraj Nijjar, 21, and Harjinder Nijjar, Mehtab Nijjar, Sarandeep Sehaj, Harsimranjeet Singh, Arshdeep Kapoor and Malkit Singh, the report added.\n\nThe three accused men had a brief appearance before an adjudicator on Saturday for an interim judicial release hearing, after which they were kept in custody.\n\nTheir next step would be to have their lawyers apply for bail, said Surrey criminal and immigration lawyer Affan Bajwa, who has no connection to the case.\n\nBajwa said their chances of being released on bail would depend on whether their lawyers could make a strong case to the judge.\n\n\"I think it may be difficult for them to be released on bail because of a possible flight risk and risk to public safety,\" he said.\n\nBajwa also said if the case goes ahead, the men would be tried in Canada and if found guilty of first-degree murder would have no chance of parole for at least 25 years.\n\nIf they are foreign nationals or permanent residents, as soon as they're released, they would face a deportation hearing by the Canada Border Services Agency, he said.\n\nIf found not guilty, they could still be deported, according to a Supreme Court of Canada ruling in September in which the nine judges unanimously ruled that a foreign national could be deemed inadmissible to Canada on security grounds under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of \"being a danger to the security of Canada,\" according to Canadian Lawyer Magazine, the Vancouver Sun report said.\n\nHundreds of local Sikhs carrying Khalistan flags and posters showed up at the courthouse. For the unversed, Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey on June 18, 2023.\n\n(With agency inputs)", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Obviously, there are political interests at work. We have long maintained that separatists, extremists and those advocating violence have been given political space in Canada,\" he said in a press briefing on Thursday.\n\n\"Our diplomats have been threatened with impunity and obstructed in their performance of duties. We have also pointed out to the Canadian authorities that figures associated with organised crimes with links in India have been allowed entry and residency. Many extradition requests are pending with them. We are having discussions at the diplomatic levels on all these matters with the Canadian side,\" he added.\n\nOn being asked if India has given consular access to the three Indians arrested in Nijjar Killing case, MEA spokesperson said that they have not received any request from the Canadian side for the same as those arrested have not asked for the consular access yet.\n\n\"In different countries, there are different norms. In certain countries, if a person of a certain country is apprehended, then it is for that national to make a request that please give consular access to my embassy and there after it is granted,\" he said.\n\nThe three men were taken into custody in Edmonton last week on Friday and are accused of first-degree murder and murderous conspiracy in connection with the June 2023 shooting of Nijjar, which severely damaged Canada's relations with India.\n\nNotably, ties between India and Canada have been strained after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused agents of the Indian government of killing Nijjar. However, India has dismissed the accusations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\".\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. The video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing.\"\n\nLast week, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist, Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nAlong with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP had said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Nijjar.

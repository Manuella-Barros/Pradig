The normally beloved Majorca holiday resort appears to be suffering from a drastic drop in the number of tourists, with many local businessowners worried about the dwindling crowds. Photographs taken on May 27 show deserted sunbeds on the town's beaches and rows of unoccupied tables outside bars. This comes just days after demonstrators marched through Majorca's capital, Palma, demanding the government take 'immediate measures' to address the island's housing crisis and tourist overcrowding. Bar owners are now worried that the \"wishes of anti-tourism protesters [have been] granted\". Local newspaper, the Majorca Daily Bulletin, also expressed its concern that Magaluf seemed \"unusually quiet\" on Monday, stating it was \"half empty if that\". It reported a sense of unease among business owners about the scarcity of tourists, while others maintained it was still bustling during the weekends. Have you been put off from visiting Spain because of the protests? Email us at webtravel@reachplc.com Following the gathering of thousands in Palma on Saturday, organisers of the protest warned they would persist in their demonstrations until the Balearic government takes action. One of the protest leaders, Javier Barbero, said: \"This has only just begun. If the reality is denied and still no measures are taken, we will take to the streets until they act.\" He clarified that their stance was not anti-tourism, but stressed: \"We have to rethink the tourism model.\" The demonstrators are now urging the local government to cap the soaring rental prices \u2014 a move that Balearic president Marga Prohens has openly refused to consider. They're also pushing for a regulation that would require individuals to reside in Majorca for a minimum of five years before they could purchase property there. Tourism accounts for 45% of the islands' revenue, as reported by Exceltur. The ongoing protests have prompted some British tourists to consider boycotting the destination. One frequent visitor commented online: \"They should be careful what they wish for. Meanwhile, another holidaymaker remarked: \"Stop going to Spain for 12 months and they will be begging us to come back.\" Despite its small permanent population, Magaluf has been favoured as a party destination as it is home to many nightclubs and bars. Many popular DJs have played at the resort, including David Guetta, Calvin Harris and Martin Garrix. Popular British culture has led to the island often adopting the nickname 'Shagaluf'. Pictures of the 'empty' resort come after the island's mayor looked to assure potential visitors that the island was a great place to visit. \u201cMy message is all the British are really welcome in Calvia, that is very important... it\u2019s not the same message you have heard in the other government,\" he said, Daily Mail reported. \u201cWe want the people to enjoy [their holidays] with respect between tourists and the residents... this situation now is creating \u2018tourism-phobia\u2019 coming from these behaviours from some tourists, not all tourists.\u201d With harmony between holidaymakers and local residents running thin, it is unclear how the summer season ahead will play out for the holiday island.

Park\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol and the leaders of NATO condemned the enhanced military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, which they viewed as posing a greater threat to not only South Korea, but also the international community.\n\nTheir joint concerns and protest came during Yoon's meetings with some of the leaders of the countries participating in the 2024 NATO summit in Washington, D.C., as well as in the joint declaration announced by the NATO member states, Wednesday (local time).\n\nYoon, who is attending the NATO gathering as the head of Indo-Pacific Partners 4 (IP4) along with Japan, Australia and New Zealand, shared his concerns over Moscow and Pyongyang's strengthened military and economic partnership, during a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\n\"Russia and North Korea recently signed a comprehensive strategic partnership and are speeding up economic ties, and these moves are causing serious concerns over security of not only East Asia but also the whole world,\" Yoon said.\n\nYoon's comments follow Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's June summit, during which they agreed to provide military assistance without delay to each other if one of them is attacked.\n\nYoon emphasized the importance of maintaining trilateral security cooperation between South Korea, Japan, and the U.S., as well as with NATO countries.\n\n\"I hope South Korea and Japan, in close cooperation with NATO member countries, will strengthen our unified response, demonstrating that the security of the North Atlantic and Northeast Asia is inseparable,\" Yoon said.\n\n\"The participation of South Korea and Japan in the NATO summit, as part of the IP4, for three consecutive years carries significant strategic implications amid the increasingly severe international security situation,\" Yoon noted.\n\nKishida also expressed grave concerns over the growing Russia-North Korea military cooperation that is posing threats to the regional security, according to the presidential office.\n\nYoon and Kishida agreed to jointly address any potential challenges through close coordination with the international community, the office said.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stand with visiting heads of state and other guests at the South Lawn of the White House before attending a state dinner at the NATO 75th anniversary summit celebration in Washington, D.C., Wednesday (local time). AFP-Yonhap\n\nWashington Summit Declaration\n\nThe NATO leaders also issued a joint declaration, strongly condemning North Korea's weapons exports to Russia.\n\nTheir response come as the North is expected to increase its arms provision to Russia to assist the latter's invasion of Ukraine -- although Moscow and Pyongayng deny such provision -- following their enhanced partnership.\n\n\"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Iran are fuelling Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine by providing direct military support to Russia, such as munitions and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which seriously impacts Euro-Atlantic security and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,\" the Washington Summit Declaration read. DPRK is the official name of North Korea.\n\n\"We strongly condemn the DPRK's exports of artillery shells and ballistic missiles, which are in violation of numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions, and note with great concern the deepening ties between the DPRK and Russia,\" the statement added.\n\nThe leaders also urged China to cease all its support to Russia's war effort, saying China's strategic partnership with Russia is causing a threat to the rule-based international order.\n\nFrom left, Prime Minister of New Zealand Christopher Luxon, South Korean first lady Kim Keon Hee, President of the Republic of Korea Yoon Suk Yeol, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska and Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida pose for a photo at the White House, Wednesday (local time). Yonhap\n\nYoon also held bilateral meetings with the leaders of six countries -- Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Finland.\n\nDuring his meetings with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Yoon stressed close security cooperation, emphasizing that North Korea's threats extend beyond the Korean Peninsula and affect the security of the Indo-Pacific as well as Europe.\n\nBesides reaffirming the mutual security commitments, the South Korean president also discussed defense cooperation with Germany and Canada, while solidifying semiconductor collaboration with the Netherlands.", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yoon and Kishida were invited to the NATO summit this year as leaders of IP4 countries.\n\nYoon also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday at the NATO summit during the welcome dinner reception hosted at the White House.\n\nYoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee met with Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska and exchanged greetings, according to reports.\n\nThe South Korean and Ukrainian leaders are likely to meet again on Thursday after attending NATO-related events. Some experts speculate that Zelensky could request expanded arms support from South Korea when he meets again with Yoon.\n\nThis observation follows the South Korean government's statement that it would review sending lethal weapons to Ukraine after North Korea and Russia signed the comprehensive strategic cooperation treaty equivalent to a military alliance.\n\nYoon also met with the leaders of Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland and the Czech Republic on the sidelines of the NATO summit, which kicked off on Tuesday and runs until Thursday.\n\nBY LIM JEONG-WON

Smith. \"To protect our freedom, democracy and economic prosperity from such reckless forces, solidarity between countries that share values along with strong power is essential.\"\n\nThis marks the first visit to the command, which was renamed the Indo-Pacific in 2018, by a South Korean president in 29 years. Then-President Kim Young-sam visited the Pacific Command, its predecessor, in 1995.\n\nYoon was greeted by Adm. Samuel Paparo, commander of Indo-Pacific Command, and Gen. Paul LaCamera, commander of U.S. Forces Korea (USKF) and other American military brass at the command.\n\nHe was first received in a welcome ceremony and later given a security briefing at the United States' oldest and largest unified combatant command on the security situation and defense posture on the Korean Peninsula from Paparo.\n\nYoon was also given a classified tour of the Joint Operations Center.\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Command is one of the U.S. military's six geographic combatant commands. It is responsible for security in the Indo-Pacific region, including overseeing the 28,500-strong U.S. troop presence in South Korea.\n\nYoon also awarded Paparo, a U.S. Navy admiral, the Tongil Medal, the highest class in the Order of National Security Merit, on Tuesday, the presidential office said.\n\nPaparo was awarded for his \"contributions to strengthening the combined defense posture while serving as commander of the Pacific Fleet\" ahead of becoming chief of the Indo-Pacific Command.\n\nYoon stressed as he presented the metal, \"North Korea's advancement of nuclear and missile capabilities and continuous provocations are harming the security of the Korean Peninsula and the region, thus a firm joint defense posture between Korea and the United States is more important than ever.\"\n\nIn a speech to encourage some 400 troops at the command, Yoon stressed the importance of trilateral cooperation between Seoul, Washington and Tokyo in response to Pyongyang and Moscow's closer relations.\n\nYoon noted that last month, Pyongyang and Moscow signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty strengthening military and economic cooperation, further deepening the concerns of the international community.\n\n\"The North Korean regime has advanced its nuclear and missile capabilities and legislated the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons while ignoring the misery of its people,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed that steadfast combined defense readiness between South Korea and the United States, along with cooperation with other partners, is more critical than ever in light of the North's growing security threats.\n\nYoon said that \"strong capabilities based on solid commitments and cooperation are the driving force that firmly protects a rules-based regional order\" and that the command provides the foundation for this.\n\nHe recalled Freedom Edge, the first multi-domain military exercise between South Korea, the United States and Japan, held in waters off the coast of Jeju Island last month, was a result of the historic trilateral summit in Camp David in August last year.\n\nLikewise, the U.S.-led Rim of the Pacific Exercise, or Rimpac, the largest annual international maritime exercise involving some 29 countries, including South Korea, is underway in waters around Hawaii.\n\nSouth Korea's Navy deployed warships, including the Aegis-equipped destroyer ROKS Yulgok Yi I and ROKS Lee Beom-seok submarine, as well as some 840 troops, for the drills, which began on June 26 and runs to Aug. 29.\n\nYoon, during the visit, discussed regional security cooperation and \"evaluated the operational activities in the Indo-Pacific\" during a classified tour of the Joint Operations Center, the command said in a statement.\n\nIt added that the visit to its headquarters was one of several engagements \"demonstrating the deep friendship between the two countries and reaffirming the ironclad commitment\" to the South Korea-U.S. alliance.\n\nOn Monday, Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee arrived in Hawaii for a five-day visit to the United States, marking their second overseas trip this year.\n\nThey later departed for Washington, where Yoon is scheduled to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit and bilateral and multilateral meetings on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nOn the sidelines of the NATO events, Yoon plans to hold bilateral meetings with more than 10 countries, including Japan, Germany and Britain, according to the presidential office. These meetings may provide an opportunity for Yoon to share his concerns about military cooperation between North Korea and Russia.\n\nBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Indo-Pacific_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Indo-Pacific Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_combatant_command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unified combatant command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Paparo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Paparo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_LaCamera", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul LaCamera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_H._M._Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camp H.

(Yonhap)\n\nMembers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on Wednesday expressed \"great concern\" about the deepening ties between North Korea and Russia, shown in the pact signed in June, and condemned North Korea's weapons exports to Russia, as President Yoon Suk Yeol, who traveled to the United States to attend the NATO summit, is moving to bolster security cooperation with NATO member states and other allies.\n\nIn a communique released on Wednesday, the Washington Summit Declaration, the 32 NATO countries stated in Article 25 that North Korea, together with Iran, is \"fuelling Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine by providing direct military support to Russia.\"\n\nThe article also states that North Korea's military support of Russia \"seriously impacts Euro-Atlantic security and undermines the global (nuclear) non-proliferation regime.\"\n\n\"We strongly condemn the DPRK's exports of artillery shells and ballistic missiles, which are in violation of numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions, and note with great concern the deepening ties between the DPRK and Russia,\" it reads. The DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is North Korea's official name.\n\n\"The Washington Summit Declaration reaffirmed that the close ties between Russia and North Korea pose a threat to global security,\" Kim Tae-hyo, the first deputy director of the presidential National Security Office, said in a briefing in Washington on Wednesday.\n\n\"Seoul will continue its cooperation with NATO member states and their Indo-Pacific partners to stand up to the threats to all of us which share core values together,\" Kim said.\n\nUpon his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Yoon held bilateral talks with his counterparts from seven countries who attend the NATO summit this week, including Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Dick Schoof, Prime Minister of Sweden Ulf Kristersson, President of the Czech Republic Petr Pavel, President of Finland Alexander Stubb and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nThe leaders in the bilateral talks \"discussed current affairs related to global security such as the continued war in Ukraine and the situation on the Korean Peninsula,\" Kim said. They also touched upon \"ways to team up with each other to address the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.\"\n\nYoon will meet more leaders attending the summit Thursday, according to the presidential office, Yoon plans to hold talks with his counterparts in the United Kingdom, Norway, Luxembourg and Poland.\n\nThe leaders agreed that the arms trade between Pyongyang and Moscow poses a security threat to both Indo-Pacific region and Europe, and pledged to take \"bold actions\" against the Pyongyang-Moscow ties, according to Kim of the National Security Office.\n\nYoon and Kishida agreed to cooperate closely with countries on friendly terms to counter the North Korea-Russia ties. Yoon has met his Japanese counterpart 11 times since his inauguration in May 2022. He is third among South Korea's leaders since 1948 in the number of bilateral talks he has had with Japan so far, two years and two months into his five-year term.\n\nWhile all eyes are on whether Yoon would meet US President Joe Biden for talks, Kim said Wednesday evening the White House and South Korea's presidential office \"reached a mutual understanding\" over the need to sit down for bilateral talks, albeit briefly. Whether Yoon would actually meet Biden has yet to be confirmed as of press time.\n\nMeanwhile, the communique also highlighted in Article 30 the role of NATO's Indo-Pacific partner countries -- namely South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand -- in dealing with common security challenges.\n\nNATO and the four partner countries will team up with each other \"through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation and technology,\" read the article.\n\nThese efforts came as Yoon and the leaders of Australia, Japan and New Zealand were invited to the annual multilateral summit for a third consecutive year.\n\nA senior official of the presidential office said on condition of anonymity that one of the outcomes in this year's summit are efforts towards institutionalizing cooperation between the NATO member states and the four Indo-Pacific partners, adding that works are underway to examine which projects NATO members and its partners would jointly take part in.\n\nThe official also said that South Korea will \"soon be able to establish\" a new intelligence-sharing mechanism with NATO authorities that will allow South Korea to keep track of Russia's use of North Korean ammunition or weapons in Ukraine.\n\nBut the official added that it would be \"unnatural\" for South Korea to announce a new set of plans to aid Ukraine during the NATO summit. Yoon had announced a $2.3-billion aid package for Ukraine, including $300 million in humanitarian aid, during the Group of 20 summit in September 2023. In July 2023 after a summit with Zelenskyy in Kyiv, he also pledged $150 million in humanitarian and non-lethal military aid for Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "koreaherald.com", "dataType": "news",

Samuel Paparo, commander of the Indo-Pacific Command, Gen. Paul LaCamera, commander of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), and Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi took part in the wreath-laying ceremony at the National Memorial Cemetery alongside Korean security and foreign affairs officials.\n\nYoon and Kim also exchanged greetings with six Korean War veterans who attended the event and expressed gratitude for their services.\n\nOver 10,000 Korean War veterans are buried at the National Memorial Cemetery, located at Punchbowl Crater and established in 1949 to honor troops who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Thus, it is considered a symbolic site representative of the decades-old Korea-U.S. alliance forged in blood.\n\nThe presidential office said the visit to the Punchbowl Cemetery and wreath-laying ceremony \"reflects the historical significance of our alliance and shows the highest respect to veterans.\"\n\nHundreds of unknown soldiers who have yet to be identified and have their remains returned to their families are buried under stone slabs engraved with the words, \"US UNKNOWN KOREA.\"\n\nPreviously, three former Korean presidents -- Syngman Rhee, Lee Myung-bak and Moon Jae-in -- visited the cemetery.\n\nYoon and Kim visited the grave of Benjamin Wilson (1921-1988), an American veteran who received the Medal of Honor, the highest U.S. military decoration, for his outstanding achievements in the Korean War, fighting in the Battle of Hwacheon in Gangwon in 1951.\n\nOn Tuesday, Yoon was scheduled to receive a security briefing at the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and give words of encouragement to the soldiers there.\n\nThe Pacific Command was renamed the Indo-Pacific Command in 2018 and is the United States' oldest and largest unified combatant command with some 380,000 service members.\n\nThe command, responsible for security in the Indo-Pacific region, is one of six geographic combatant commands of the U.S. military. It integrates U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps forces, covering more of the globe than the other five commands and oversees the 28,500-strong U.S. troop presence in South Korea, where American forces have been stationed since the outbreak of the Korean War over seven decades ago.\n\nYoon's visit to the command could send a powerful message to the international community on the strength of the Seoul-Washington alliance amid growing security threats due to the mutual defense pact signed between Pyongyang and Moscow following last month's summit between the two countries' leaders.\n\nThe presidential office noted this will be the first visit by a Korean president to the command since late President Kim Young-sam did so 29 years ago.\n\nYoon heads to Washington on Wednesday for the second leg of his U.S. trip to participate in the NATO summit, where he is expected to focus on concerns over budding military cooperation between North Korea and Russia.\n\nOn the margins of the NATO summit, Yoon is expected to hold bilateral talks with some 10 countries, including possibly Japan, according to the presidential office Monday.\n\nYoon's summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, currently being arranged, could discuss countermeasures against North Korea-Russia military cooperation, which has been upgraded to the level of a quasi-alliance after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new comprehensive strategic partnership treaty last month.\n\nYoon told Reuters in a written interview Monday that South Korea would decide on weapons support for Ukraine based on how the new defense pact between North Korea and Russia plays out.\n\nIt is unclear if Yoon will hold separate bilateral talks with U.S. President Joe Biden, who has a tight schedule as host of the NATO summit.\n\nOn Thursday, Yoon will attend the NATO summit, meet with the other Indo-Pacific NATO partner countries and speak at the NATO Public Forum.\n\nSouth Korea was invited to the NATO summit for a third consecutive year as one of four NATO partners in the Indo-Pacific region, or IP4, which also includes Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Yoon will also meet with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

M. Smith in Honolulu, Hawaii, Tuesday. (Yonhap)\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol stressed the United States Indo-Pacific Command's role in taking the alliance between Seoul and Washington to a new height, amid growing geopolitical tensions beyond the Korean Peninsula.\n\nYoon on Tuesday local time visited the headquarters of the Indo-Pacific Command at Camp H. M. Smith in Honolulu, Hawaii, for the first time as the South Korean head of state in 29 years after President Kim Young-sam.\n\n\"Among many other important missions, the Indo-Pacific Command supports ROK-US combined combat readiness and plays a central role in providing US augmentation in case of contingency on the Korean Peninsula. It's indeed the central pillar of the ROK-US alliance,\" Yoon told some 400 US troops stationed in Honolulu, Hawaii, referring to South Korea as its official name Republic of Korea.\n\n\"Strong capabilities undergirded by rock-solid commitment and close cooperation are the true driving force defending the rules-based order and the region based on values and norms, and US Indo-Pacific Command is at the very heart of this effort,\" he said.\n\nYoon also pointed to the growing geopolitical tension on the Korean Peninsula, with the speculation of military exchanges between North Korea and Russia, which the West suspects have allowed Russia to use North Korean ammunition and weapons in its war against Ukraine.\n\n\"I stand here amid a wave of global geopolitical situations and instability on the Korean Peninsula, because visiting no other place can better demonstrate and strengthen our ironclad alliance and robust combined defense posture than coming to the Indo-Pacific Command,\" Yoon said.\n\nYoon added that strength based on international solidarity is key to fighting \"reckless actors.\"\n\n\"Last month, Pyongyang signed a treaty on a comprehensive strategic partnership with Moscow and pledged to strengthen their military and economic cooperation, raising concerns of the international community,\" Yoon said.\n\n\"In order to defend our freedom and democracy and prosperity from those reckless actors, we need strength, and countries with shared common values must unite in solidarity.\"\n\nThis came as Yoon was quoted as saying by the presidential office during his meeting with Adm. Samuel Paparo, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, that the combined defense readiness posture of South Korea and the United States is more important than ever amid North Korea's continued nuclear capability advancement and provocations.\n\nPaparo, who Yoon awarded the Tongil Medal of the Order of National Security Merit on Tuesday, was quoted as saying by Yoon's spokesperson Kim Soo-kyung that the president's decision to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine \"drew a clear insight that the security in Ukraine and the security in Indo-Pacific region are interconnected.\"\n\nSpokesperson Kim also said that first lady Kim Keon-hee visited the Korean Christian Church in Honolulu. Kim thanked overseas Koreans in Hawaii for their contribution to the South Korea-US alliance, according to the presidential office.\n\nYoon departed from Hawaii Tuesday afternoon to fly to Washington to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit later this week, as Yoon represents one of the four Indo-Pacific partners, along with Japan, Australia and New Zealand.", "source": {"uri": "koreaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "son_ji_hyoung@koreaherald.com", "name": "Son Ji-hyoung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Indo-Pacific_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Indo-Pacific Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_H._M._Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camp H.

In his remarks on Tuesday to open the event, the president emphasized NATO's support for non-member Ukraine - whose president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is in attendance - and NATO's wish to see Russia defeated in its invasion of the country. He recognized the presence of NATO's \"Indo-Pacific Partners\" in passing, but did not mention North Korea as a threat of particular concern to NATO.\n\nYoon, a conservative, has spent much of his tenure making the case that North Korea is more than a regional threat. The expanding ties between Russia and North Korea, he told Reuters, make the communist regime an increasingly visible threat to Europe. North Korea has long maintained ties with Russia and the former Soviet Union, but dramatically expanded the nature of its defense ties with Moscow by signing a \"comprehensive partnership\" on security in June. The deal, signed during Russian strongman Vladimir Putin's visit to Pyongyang that month, requires either party to offer military support in the event that the other is attacked. It remains unclear at press time if either party will interpret Ukrainian self-defense operations against Russian forces as an attack that requires North Korean intervention.\n\n\"Military co-operation between Russia and North Korea poses a distinct threat and grave challenge to the peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Europe,\" Yoon told Reuters in remarks published on Tuesday. The South Korean president said he would raise the issue of North Korea complicating the already challenging war theater in Ukraine with other world leaders at the NATO summit.\n\n\"North Korea is clearly a menace to the international society,\" Yoon continued. \"I hope that Russia will sensibly decide which side - the South or the North - is more important and necessary for its own interests.\"\n\nYoon added that his government is open to maintaining relations with Russia but \"the future of ROK [South Korea]-Russia relations depends entirely on Russia's actions.\"\n\nThe newspaper Korea JoongAng Daily reported on Wednesday that Yoon is expected to hold meetings with \"more than 10 countries, including Japan, Germany, and Britain,\" during his time at the NATO summit. Yoon is one of four non-NATO states - the others being Australia, New Zealand, and Japan - attending the summit in their capacity as Indo-Pacific NATO partners. He has attended NATO summits consecutively since 2022, when he became the first South Korean president to do so.\n\nYoon made a stop in Hawaii before traveling to Washington, delivering remarks on Tuesday expressing commitment to improving military cooperation with America.\n\n\"North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile capabilities and continued provocations are threatening security on the Korean Peninsula and in the region. A steadfast combined defense readiness is more critical than ever,\" Yoon said in Hawaii, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap.\n\n\"Strong power and solidarity among countries that share values are essential to protecting our liberal democracy and economic prosperity from these reckless forces,\" he continued.\n\nYoon will be facing a Washington particularly ill-prepared to handle the threat of communist North Korea when he attends NATO meetings on Wednesday. Biden has clearly failed to prioritize keeping Pyongyang's nuclear threat at bay, focusing most of his foreign policy efforts on Ukraine and pressuring Israel to limit its self-defense operations against Hamas.\n\nThe State Department's top official on North Korea, Senior Official for the DPRK [North Korea] and Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs Jung Pak, resigned sometime in the past week, Yonhap revealed on Tuesday. Pak's State Department biography still shows her at press time as an employee of the federal government, but Yonhap cited anonymous sources who confirmed that she had resigned. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller later confirmed that Pak \"stepped down\" and the Biden administration has not formally appointed a replacement.\n\nPutin's visit to North Korea in June, while not explicitly related to Ukraine, has raised the possibility of greater support from the communist dictatorship for the Russian invasion. North Korean state media described Putin as enthusiastic about growing ties with North Korea, celebrating an \"unprecedentedly high level of comprehensive strategic partnership\" between the two countries.\n\nThe South Korean government responded to North Korea cutting a military deal with Russia by threatening to arm Ukraine. While an ally of Kyiv's - Yoon paid a surprise visit to the capital in July 2023 - South Korea has offered only humanitarian aid to Ukraine, refusing to arm it. Yoon and Zelensky are expected to discuss their bilateral ties in Washington this week.\n\n\"As for the supply of lethal weapons to the combat zone in Ukraine, it would be a very big mistake,\" Putin told reporters in June, responding to South Korea. \"I hope it will not happen. If it does, then we too will then make the respective decisions, which South Korea's current leadership is unlikely to be pleased with.\"\n\nYoon's government has since insisted that it would make no moves prior to observing Russia's behavior regarding the North.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com",

(Sergei Supinsky, AFP/Getty Images/TNS)\n\nOne of the most influential people attending the NATO summit in Washington leads a country that is not a member. Yet it holds vast stores of weapons sought by the bloc to help Ukraine fight off Russia, and perhaps tip the battle in Kyiv's favor.\n\nUkraine needs artillery shells. South Korea has millions, and there is a push to convince its President Yoon Suk Yeol to change a government policy that prohibits Seoul from sending lethal aid to countries at war.\n\nYoon is attending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit this week for the third time, but this visit is different. Just weeks before it opened, his government said a defense pact signed between Russia and North Korea in June has made it consider whether it's time to start sending weapons to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's forces.\n\nZelenskyy, who has been seeking weapons from South Korea since Russia's full-scale invasion started in 2022, will be attending the summit in Washington aimed at proving that NATO is as strong as ever in its 75th year. He is expected to speak at a meeting of the Indo-Pacific Four partners -- Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea -- the Yomiuri newspaper reported, where he could again lay out his case for weapons.\n\n\"The types of weapons South Korea can provide Ukraine are the ones that can make breakthroughs in the current stalemate on the front lines,\" said Park Won Gon, a professor at South Korea's Ewha Womans University specializing in international relations.\n\nApart from the appeals from Zelenskyy, leaked intelligence obtained by the New York Times last year indicates Washington has been seeking to have Yoon send artillery to help Ukraine. Yoon's aides were worried about pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden, a document showed, and the Yoon government has denied the claims.\n\nCongress finally approved $61 billion in funding in April, helping shift the balance of firepower, but the U.S. and its European partners still need to ramp up their ability to make artillery shells.\n\nThe European Union missed a pledge to provide Ukraine with 1 million rounds of artillery by the end of March, and any munitions from South Korea could help fill shortfalls. Ukraine is estimated to need at least 200,000 rounds a month.\n\nAn unnamed senior NATO official said anything that South Korea provides to help Ukraine defend itself would be welcome, Yonhap News reported.\n\nSouth Korea has 155-millimeter artillery shells that are the NATO standard used by Ukraine. The stock is estimated to be at over 3 million shells, Yonhap reported.\n\nSeoul may be less worried now about drawing down its inventory after seeing North Korea sending to Russia what Yoon's government believes could be nearly 5 million shells. These arms transfers translated into Kyiv's troops being outgunned by as much as 10-1 by President Vladimir Putin's forces, as military aid to Ukraine was delayed in the U.S. Congress this year.\n\nSouth Korea could also consider sending 105mm artillery shells, which have less range but are fired from howitzers that are lighter and more mobile, the Center for Strategic & International Studies said in a report in March. South Korea has as many as 3.4 million shells that can be used by Ukraine, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, countries bordering Russia have been buying weapons from the likes of South Korea's leading defense contractor, Hanwha Aerospace Co. Its tanks and howitzers are seen as less expensive than those from U.S. makers and able to defeat Russian systems.\n\nYoon has said any decision on sending weapons would depend on Russia's action. Lawmaker Kim Gunn, who served under Yoon as a chief nuclear envoy until February, said the threat to supply arms to Ukraine is leverage to deter Russia from providing military support to North Korea.\n\nOfficials in Seoul have indicated a red line would be material, particularly technology that enhances Kim Jong Un's ability to make weapons of mass destruction. Putin has said he can't exclude providing Kim with high-precision weapons in response to Western military assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\"From Seoul's point of view, Russia's cooperation with North Korea is a direct threat to its national security,\" said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a senior fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center. She said it not only aids in advancing North Korea's weapons development but helps Pyongyang \"manage and even improve its national economy by reviving the munitions industry.\"\n\nLee, who worked as an analyst for the CIA's Open Source Enterprise, said South Korea has been able to deflect pressure by promoting other ways to contribute to NATO, such as cybersecurity, and Seoul should move cautiously.\n\n\"Direct provision of weapons to Ukraine is a major step, and that decision should be made based on South Korea's national interest, which should also take into consideration its longer-term interest vis-a-vis Russia,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_herskovitz@stripes.com", "name": "Jon

South Korea currently adheres to a strict government policy prohibiting the export of lethal military equipment to nations engaged in armed conflict.\n\nHowever, a defence deal between inked between Russia and North Korea last month has forced Yoon government to consider whether it's time to start sending weapons to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy forces in Ukraine.\n\nAll eyes on Yoon\n\nAll eyes will be on Yoon, who is attending the Nato summit this week for the third time, as bloc leaders are expecting something positive from the South Korean President.\n\n\"The types of weapons South Korea can provide Ukraine are the ones that can make breakthroughs in the current stalemate on the front lines,\" Bloomberg quoted Park Won Gon, a professor at South Korea's Ewha Womans University, specialising in international relations, as saying.\n\nZelenskyy, who has been seeking weapons from South Korea since Russia's full-scale invasion started in 2022, will be attending the summit in Washington aimed at proving that Nato is as strong as ever in its 75th year.\n\nZelenskyy is also likely to speak at a meeting of the Indo-Pacific Four partners -- Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea -- where he could again lay out his case for weapons, reported Yomiuri newspaper.\n\nAccording to New York Times, citing a leaked intelligence obtained last year, Washington has been seeking to have Yoon send artillery to help Ukraine. Yoon's aides were worried about pressure from US President Joe Biden, a document showed, but the Yoon government has denied the claims.\n\nIn April, Congress approved $61 billion in funding, which has helped tip the scales, but both the US and its European allies must still enhance their capacity to produce artillery shells.\n\nThe European Union failed to meet its commitment to supply Ukraine with 1 million rounds of artillery by the end of March. Additional munitions from South Korea could help address these shortages, as Ukraine reportedly requires at least 200,000 rounds monthly_._\n\n\"Any support from South Korea to bolster Ukraine's defence capabilities would be greatly appreciated,\" Yonhap News Agency quoted n unnamed senior NATO official as saying.\n\nYoon has said any decision on sending weapons would depend on Russia's action.\n\nLawmaker Kim Gunn, who previously worked as Yoon's chief nuclear envoy until February, had said that the threat to supply arms to Ukraine serves as leverage to deter Russia from sending military assistance to North Korea.\n\nOfficials in Seoul have indicated a red line would be material, especially technologies that could enhance Kim's capability to produce weapons of mass destruction.\n\nPutin has indicated the possibility of providing Kim with high-precision weapons in response to Western military aid to Ukraine, although he did not rule it out.\n\n\"From Seoul's point of view, Russia's cooperation with North Korea is a direct threat to its national security,\" Bloomberg quoted Rachel Minyoung Lee, a senior fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center, as saying.\n\nShe said it not only aids in advancing North Korea's weapons development but helps Pyongyang \"manage and even improve its national economy by reviving the munitions industry.\"\n\nLee, who worked as an analyst for the CIA's Open Source Enterprise, said South Korea has been able to deflect pressure by promoting other ways to contribute to Nato, such as cyber security, and Seoul should move cautiously.\n\n\"Direct provision of weapons to Ukraine is a major step, and that decision should be made based on South Korea's national interest, which should also take into consideration its longer-term interest vis-a-vis Russia,\" she added.\n\nSouth Korea weapon stockpile\n\nAccording to Yonhap, South Korea possesses over 3 million 155 millimeter artillery shells, which are NATO standard and used by Ukraine.\n\nSeoul may be less worried now about reducing its stockpile, given reports that North Korea may have sent nearly 5 million shells to Russia. This influx has left Kyiv's forces at a severe disadvantage, potentially facing a ten-to-one firepower imbalance against President Vladimir Putin's troops due to delays in US congressional military aid to Ukraine this year.\n\nThe Center for Strategic & International Studies suggested in a March report that South Korea could consider supplying 105 mm artillery shells. Although these have shorter range, they are fired from lighter and more mobile howitzers.\n\nThe report estimates South Korea has up to 3.4 million such shells available for potential use by Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, countries bordering Russia have been buying weapons from the likes of South Korea's leading defence contractor Hanwha Aerospace Co. Its tanks and howitzers are seen as less expensive than those from US makers and able to defeat Russian systems.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"},

A firmer combined defense posture is more important than ever,\" Yoon said on Tuesday in a visit to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.\n\nYoon, a vocal critic of Pyongyang, was the first South Korean president to visit the U.S. military's largest unified combatant command since 1995, his office said, in line with his strong backing of the Mutual Defense Treaty between Seoul and Washington.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has doubled down on ballistic weapons tests prohibited by multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, and his recent closeness with Russian President Vladimir Putin has increased Western concerns about North Korea's effect on security in Europe.\n\nNorth Korea's \"illicit arms deals with Russia\" and Kim's signing of a mutual defense pledge with Putin have deepened international concerns, Yoon said, according to a news release prepared by his spokesperson.\n\n\"Strong force and solidarity among countries that share our values are essential to defend our freedom, democracy and economic prosperity from these reckless forces,\" South Korea's president was quoted as saying.\n\nAdmiral Sam Paparo, the commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said Yoon had demonstrated \"clear insight that Ukraine's security and the Indo-Pacific's security are interconnected,\" Yoon's office said.\n\nPaparo also praised Yoon for advancing bilateral ties with Japan, another U.S. ally, at the expense of political capital at home, the statement added.\n\nSouth Korea hosts 28,500 American troops as part of U.S. Forces Korea, while U.S. Forces Japan is 54,000 strong -- the largest number of forward-deployed U.S. military personnel anywhere in the world outside U.S. territory.\n\nNewsweek contacted the U.S. Department of Defense, North Korean Embassy in Beijing and Russian Foreign Ministry for comment by email.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea have jointly accused Pyongyang of supplying ballistic missiles and millions of rounds of artillery shells to Russia for use in its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"I think we have made quite clear our great concern about increased collaboration between the DPRK and Russia,\" U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a news briefing on Monday, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name.\n\n\"We've seen ... the DPRK supporting Russia's war machine that is targeting and killing innocent civilians in Ukraine and violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of another United Nations member in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, and we will continue to work with our allies and partners to counter that relationship,\" Miller said.\n\nWhile Kim consolidates power among loyal party members at home, his neighbors believe he can have a destabilizing effect in Europe.\n\nThat is the message South Korea's Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida plan to carry to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday when they attend NATO's annual summit as representatives from the Indo-Pacific.\n\nSeparately this week, Pyongyang

Yet it holds vast stores of weapons sought by the bloc to help Ukraine fight off Russia, and perhaps tip the battle in Kyiv's favor.\n\nUkraine needs artillery shells. South Korea has millions and there is a push to convince its President Yoon Suk Yeol to change a government policy that prohibits Seoul from sending lethal aid to countries at war.\n\nYoon is attending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit this week for the third time but this visit is different. Just weeks before it opened, his government said a defense pact signed between Russia and North Korea in June has made it consider whether it's time to start sending weapons to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's forces.\n\nZelenskyy, who has been seeking weapons from South Korea since Russia's full-scale invasion started in 2022, will be attending the summit in Washington aimed at proving that NATO is as strong as ever in its 75th year. He is expected to speak at a meeting of the Indo-Pacific Four partners -- Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea -- the Yomiuri newspaper reported, where he could again lay out his case for weapons.\n\n\"The types of weapons South Korea can provide Ukraine are the ones that can make breakthroughs in the current stalemate on the front lines,\" said Park Won Gon, a professor at South Korea's Ewha Womans University, specializing in international relations.\n\nApart from the appeals from Zelenskyy, leaked intelligence obtained by the New York Times last year indicates Washington has been seeking to have Yoon send artillery to help Ukraine. Yoon's aides were worried about pressure from US President Joe Biden, a document showed, and the Yoon government has denied the claims.\n\nCongress finally approved $61 billion in funding in April, helping shift the balance of firepower, but the US and its European partners still need to ramp up their ability to make artillery shells.\n\nThe European Union missed a pledge to provide Ukraine with 1 million rounds of artillery by end-March and any munitions from South Korea could help fill shortfalls. Ukraine is estimated to need at least 200,000 rounds a month.\n\nAn unnamed senior Nato official said anything that South Korea provides to help Ukraine defend itself would be welcome, Yonhap News agency reported.\n\nSouth Korea has 155-millimeter artillery shells that are the Nato standard used by Ukraine. The stock is estimated to be at over 3 million shells, Yonhap reported.\n\nSeoul may be less worried now about drawing down its inventory after seeing North Korea sending to Russia what Yoon's government believes could be nearly 5 million shells. These arms transfers translated into Kyiv's troops being outgunned by as much as 10-1 by President Vladimir Putin's forces as military aid to Ukraine was delayed in the US Congress this year.\n\nSouth Korea could also consider sending 105 mm artillery shells, which have less range but are fired from howitzers that are lighter and more mobile, the Center for Strategic & International Studies said in a report in March. South Korea has as many as 3.4 million shells that can be used by Ukraine, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, countries bordering Russia have been buying weapons from the likes of South Korea's leading defense contractor Hanwha Aerospace Co. Its tanks and howitzers are seen as less expensive than those from US makers and able to defeat Russian systems.\n\nYoon has said any decision on sending weapons would depend on Russia's action. Lawmaker Kim Gunn, who served under Yoon as a chief nuclear envoy until February, said the threat to supply arms to Ukraine is leverage to deter Russia from providing military support to North Korea.\n\nOfficials in Seoul have indicated a red line would be material, particularly technology that enhances Kim's ability to make weapons of mass destruction. Putin has said he can't exclude providing Kim with high-precision weapons in response to Western military assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\"From Seoul's point of view, Russia's cooperation with North Korea is a direct threat to its national security,\" said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a senior fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center. She said it not only aids in advancing North Korea's weapons development but also helps Pyongyang \"manage and even improve its national economy by reviving the munitions industry.\"\n\nLee, who worked as an analyst for the CIA's Open Source Enterprise, said South Korea has been able to deflect pressure by promoting other ways to contribute to Nato, such as cyber security, and Seoul should move cautiously.\n\n\"Direct provision of weapons to Ukraine is a major step, and that decision should be made based on South Korea's national interest, which should also take into consideration its longer-term interest vis-a-vis Russia,\" she said.

10) to bolster security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization amid deepening military cooperation between North Korea and Russia.\n\nYoon and Kishida shared the view as they met bilaterally on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Washington, where they were invited as leaders of the four Indo-Pacific partner nations, which also include Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe Nato summit came just weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un produced a sweeping security cooperation agreement.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Nato leaders issued a summit declaration strongly condemning North Korea's weapons exports to Russia.\n\n\"The recent moves by Russia and North Korea are causing serious concern not only in East Asia but also for global security,\" Yoon said at the start of the talks with Kishida.\n\n\"I hope that South Korea and Japan will cooperate closely with Nato member countries and reaffirm that the security of the North Atlantic and Northeast Asia cannot be separated.\"\n\nYoon said Moscow's close alignment with Pyongyang highlights the importance of the trilateral security cooperation among South Korea, the United States and Japan, as outlined in their Camp David summit in August 2023.\n\n\"The two leaders shared concerns over the strengthening of military and economic cooperation between Russia and North Korea through the signing of the 'comprehensive strategic partnership' treaty,\" Yoon's office said in a statement.\n\n\"They agreed that South Korea and Japan will closely cooperate and work together with the international community to address the Russia-North Korea military cooperation that violates UN Security Council resolutions,\" it added.\n\nKishida also said the security of the two regions is \"inseparable.\"\n\n\"The security of the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific is inseparable.\n\n\"This summit provides an opportunity to deepen cooperation between Nato and our Indo-Pacific partners,\" Kishida said through a translator.\n\nYoon and Kishida last met in Seoul in May as part of a trilateral summit with China. - The Korea Herald/ANN", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType":

(Yonhap)\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Yoon Suk Yeol arrived in Washington on Wednesday to attend a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit with a strong message against North Korea's military cooperation with Russia amid the prolonged war in Ukraine.\n\nSouth Korea was invited to the NATO summit for the third consecutive year as one of the Indo-Pacific partners, alongside Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDuring his two-day stay, Yoon is expected to have a series of bilateral meetings with leaders from over 10 countries, including Japan, Britain, Germany, Canada, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden and the Czech Republic.\n\nLater in the day, Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee are scheduled to join a welcome dinner hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden.\n\nOn Thursday, the president will have a four-way meeting with his counterparts from Japan, Australia and New Zealand and attend a session of the NATO allies and partners to boost cooperation between the transatlantic military alliance and the Indo-Pacific.\n\nHe will also deliver a speech at the NATO Public Forum, an event co-organized by five think tanks in Europe and the United States.\n\nStakes are higher for this year's summit as South Korea has said it would consider supplying arms to Ukraine after Russia signed a mutual defense treaty with North Korea last month.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned it would be a \"big mistake\" if Seoul sent arms to Ukraine, while President Yoon insisted Seoul's decision would depend on Moscow's approach to its military cooperation with Pyongyang.\n\nSeoul officials are concerned that Moscow could provide technological assistance to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program in return for its munitions and weapons support for Russia's war in Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "koreaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The event celebrates the military alliance's 75th anniversary. The summit is being held at a delicate time for the world. US President Joe Biden, who has offered military aid to Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression for the past three years, cannot guarantee he will serve another term. While Yoon should proactively support the NATO alliance, he should absolutely refrain from offering lethal weapons to Ukraine, a move that would bring about disastrous consequences for Korea's national security.\n\nAhead of the NATO summit in Washington, DC, Yoon visited Hawaii. During Yoon's conversation with Adm. Samuel Paparo of the US Indo-Pacific Command, he referred to the recent military pact between Russia and North Korea -- a restoration of a Cold War alliance -- as \"reckless elements.\"\n\n\"In order to protect our freedom and democracy and economic prosperity from these reckless elements,\" Yoon said, \"solidarity among countries that share values as well as strength is essential.\"\n\nIt's inappropriate for the president to personally step into the spotlight to make provocative statements regarding Russia and North Korea at every opportunity. It is true, however, that the recent pact to establish a \"strategic partnership\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed in Pyongyang on June 19 brings spillover from the war in Ukraine directly to South Korea's doorstep.\n\nThe leaders of South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand -- a group of non-member NATO partners in the Indo-Pacific -- will hold a separate summit on Thursday. The summit is expected to yield a joint document that clarifies NATO's expanded cooperation with its four partners in the region. Such cooperation is likely to include support for Ukraine, military and strategic use of AI technology, efforts to fight misinformation and disinformation spread by strategic enemies, and upgrading joint cybersecurity. The Indo-Pacific 4 are likely to serve as NATO's Indo-Pacific foothold when the alliance formalizes its framework in East Asia. When this cooperative framework officially steps forward, it is obvious that not only Russia, but China, will step in to oppose it.\n\nNATO has continually stressed that support for Ukraine is the main agenda of this summit. In a July 9 statement addressed to South Korea, a senior NATO official said that \"anything\" Korea can provide to help Ukraine upgrade its defensive capacity will be \"warmly welcomed.\"\n\nOn the same day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed NATO members in Washington, urging them to \"step out of the shadows, to make strong decisions work, to act and not to wait for November or any other month.\" Considering South Korea's recent statements regarding support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy may have made additional requests to Yoon to approve weapons shipments.\n\nYet if South Korea sends lethal weapons to Ukraine, Russia may retaliate via North Korea -- and the consequences may be too much for us to bear. We ask that the president not focus so deeply on Western alliances and cooperative networks that he makes a rash decision. Sending lethal weapons to Ukraine is primarily the responsibility of NATO. South Korea needs to focus on humanitarian and non-lethal aid.", "source": {"uri": "english.hani.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

South Korea has millions. Will a Nato summit deal deliver?", "body": "Ukraine needs an estimated 200,000 rounds a month, at least. North Korea is believed to have sent Russia nearly 5 million shells so far\n\nOne of the most influential people attending the Nato summit leads a country that is not a member. Yet it holds vast stores of weapons sought by the bloc to help Ukraine fight off Russia, and perhaps tip the battle in Kyiv\u2019s favour.\n\nUkraine needs artillery shells. South Korea has millions, and there is a push to convince its President Yoon Suk-yeol to change a government policy that prohibits Seoul from sending lethal aid to countries at war.\n\nYoon is attending the transatlantic security alliance\u2019s summit this week for the third time but this visit is different. Just weeks before it opened, his government said a defence pact signed between Russia and North Korea in June has made it consider whether it\u2019s time to start sending weapons to President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s forces.\n\nZelensky, who has been seeking weapons from South Korea since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion started in 2022, will be attending the summit in Washington aimed at proving that Nato is as strong as ever in its 75th year. He is expected to speak at a meeting of the Indo-Pacific Four partners \u2013 Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea \u2013 the Yomiuri newspaper reported, where he could again lay out his case for weapons.\n\n\u201cThe types of weapons South Korea can provide Ukraine are the ones that can make breakthroughs in the current stalemate on the front lines,\u201d said Park Won-gon, a professor at South Korea\u2019s Ewha Womans University, specialising in international relations.\n\nApart from the appeals from Zelensky, leaked intelligence obtained by The New York Times last year indicates Washington has been seeking to have Yoon send artillery to help Ukraine. Yoon\u2019s aides were worried about pressure from US President Joe Biden, a document showed, and the Yoon government has denied the claims.Direct provision of weapons to Ukraine is a major stepRachel Minyoung Lee, Stimson Centre\u2019s 38 North Programme\n\nCongress finally approved US$61 billion in funding in April, helping shift the balance of firepower, but the US and its European partners still need to ramp up their ability to make artillery shells.\n\nThe European Union missed a pledge to provide Ukraine with 1 million rounds of artillery by the end of March, and any munitions from South Korea could help fill shortfalls. Ukraine is estimated to need at least 200,000 rounds a month.\n\nAn unnamed senior Nato official said anything that South Korea provides to help Ukraine defend itself would be welcome, Yonhap News agency reported.\n\nSouth Korea has 155-millimetre artillery shells that are the Nato standard used by Ukraine. The stock is estimated to be at over 3 million shells, Yonhap reported.\n\nSeoul may be less worried now about drawing down its inventory after seeing North Korea sending to Russia what Yoon\u2019s government believes could be nearly 5 million shells. These arms transfers translated into Kyiv\u2019s troops being outgunned by as much as 10-1 by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces as military aid to Ukraine was delayed in the US Congress this year.\n\nSouth Korea could also consider sending 105mm artillery shells, which have less range but are fired from howitzers that are lighter and more mobile, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said in a report in March. South Korea has as many as 3.4 million shells that can be used by Ukraine, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, countries bordering Russia have been buying weapons from the likes of South Korea\u2019s leading defence contractor, Hanwha Aerospace Co. Its tanks and howitzers are seen as less expensive than those from US makers and able to defeat Russian systems.\n\nYoon has said any decision on sending weapons would depend on Russia\u2019s action. Lawmaker Kim Gunn, who served under Yoon as a chief nuclear envoy until February, said the threat to supply arms to Ukraine is leverage to deter Russia from providing military support to North Korea.\n\nOfficials in Seoul have indicated a red line would be material, particularly technology that enhances Kim\u2019s ability to make weapons of mass destruction. Putin has said he can\u2019t exclude providing Kim with high-precision weapons in response to Western military assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFrom Seoul\u2019s point of view, Russia\u2019s cooperation with North Korea is a direct threat to its national security,\u201d said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a senior fellow with the 38 North Programme at the Stimson Centre. She said it not only aids in advancing North Korea\u2019s weapons development but helps Pyongyang \u201cmanage and even improve its national economy by reviving the munitions industry\u201d.\n\nLee, who worked as an analyst for the CIA\u2019s Open Source Enterprise, said South Korea has been able to deflect pressure by promoting other ways to contribute to Nato, such cybersecurity, and Seoul should move cautiously.\n\n\u201cDirect provision of weapons to Ukraine is a major step, and that decision should be made based on South Korea\u2019s national interest, which should also take into consideration its longer-term interest vis-\u00e0-vis Russia,\u201d she said.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Korea, Russia while speaking at US Indo-Pacific Command", "body": "President Yoon Suk-yeol speaks at the US Indo-Pacific Command at Camp HM Smith in Hawaii on July 9, 2024, (local time). (Yonhap)\n\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol said that North Korea \"threatens peace not only on the Korean Peninsula but also globally by engaging in illegal weapons trade with Russia\" during a visit to the United States Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii ahead of attending the NATO summit in Washington.\n\nThe president denounced North Korea while offering words of encouragement to military personnel at the military command on Tuesday (local time). \"The North Korean regime is advancing its nuclear and missile capabilities and legislating the preemptive use of nuclear weapons while ignoring the miserable lives of its people,\" he said. \"The signing of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and stronger economic cooperation with Russia is deepening the concerns of the international community.\"\n\nYoon directed sharp remarks at North Korea and stressed the importance of Seoul's alliance with Washington and cooperation between Korea, Japan and the US, stating, \"To defend our freedom, democracy and economic prosperity against such imprudent forces, both potent power and solidarity between nations who share common values is essential.\"\n\nAfter mentioning the trilateral summit meeting between Korea, Japan and US at Camp David last August and the 2024 Rim of the Pacific, an international maritime training exercise currently taking place in Hawaii with the Korean Navy in attendance, Yoon said, \"Strong capability based on robust commitment and cooperation is the driving force that steadfastly upholds rules-based order in the region.\"\n\nThe president explained the reason behind his visit to the command was \"to shore up the ironclad KORUS alliance and our combined defense readiness amid dire international circumstances and the security situation on the Korean Peninsula.\" Yoon referred to the Indo-Pacific Command as \"a pillar of the KORUS alliance that supports combined defense readiness and plays a central role in the US Key Resolve strategy in the event of an emergency on the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\n\"The dedication and hard work of Indo-Pacific Command staff are the true strength that drives the powerful KORUS alliance, trilateral Korea-Japan-US cooperation and solidarity in the international community,\" he added.\n\nThis is the first time a South Korean president has visited the US Indo-Pacific Command in 29 years. Chun Doo-hwan paid a visit to the facility in 1981, while President Kim Young-sam visited the Pacific Command, the predecessor of the current command, in 1995.\n\nThe presidential office stressed the significance of this visit, noting that the US Indo-Pacific Command \"covers the largest area (approximately 100 million square miles, or 52% of the planet's surface) among the six US regional commands (Northern, Southern, Indo-Pacific, European, Middle East and Africa), and plays a crucial role in the security of the Korean Peninsula, including commanding the US Forces Korea.\"\n\nYoon presented Adm. Samuel Paparo, the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, with the Order of National Security Merit Tongil Medal in recognition of his contributions to bolstering combined defense readiness during Paparo's three years as the commander of the US Pacific Fleet. Yoon and Paparo also took a commemorative photograph and chanted \"We go together,\" the slogan of the KORUS alliance, in unison.\n\nYoon arrived in Washington on Wednesday to attend the NATO summit. During the event, he is also scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with ten or so countries, including Japan.", "source": {"uri": "english.hani.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Indo-Pacific_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Indo-Pacific Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Young-sam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Young-sam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Korea_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camp David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Paparo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Paparo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_National_Security_Merit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Order of National Security Merit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Key Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chun_Doo-hwan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chun Doo-hwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Korea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Forces Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Pacific_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Pacific Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Korea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of South Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Hapkido", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Hapkido", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://flexible.img.hani.co.kr/flexible/normal/640/427/imgdb/original/2024/0711/771720686202535.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719825", "eventUri": "eng-9719825", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Yet it holds vast stores of weapons sought by the bloc to help Ukraine fight off Russia, and perhaps tip the battle in Kyiv's favor.\n\nUkraine needs artillery shells. South Korea has millions, and there is a push to convince its President Yoon Suk Yeol to change a government policy that prohibits Seoul from sending lethal aid to countries at war.\n\nYoon is attending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit this week for the third time but this visit is different. Just weeks before it opened, his government said a defense pact signed between Russia and North Korea in June has made it consider whether it's time to start sending weapons to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's forces.\n\nZelenskyy, who has been seeking weapons from South Korea since Russia's full-scale invasion started in 2022, will be attending the summit in Washington aimed at proving that NATO is as strong as ever in its 75th year. He is expected to speak at a meeting of the Indo-Pacific Four partners - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - the Yomiuri newspaper reported, where he could again lay out his case for weapons.\n\n\"The types of weapons South Korea can provide Ukraine are the ones that can make breakthroughs in the current stalemate on the front lines,\" said Park Won Gon, a professor at South Korea's Ewha Womans University, specializing in international relations.\n\nApart from the appeals from Zelenskyy, leaked intelligence obtained by the New York Times last year indicates Washington has been seeking to have Yoon send artillery to help Ukraine. Yoon's aides were worried about pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden, a document showed, and the Yoon government has denied the claims.\n\nCongress finally approved $61 billion in funding in April, helping shift the balance of firepower, but the U.S. and its European partners still need to ramp up their ability to make artillery shells.\n\nThe European Union missed a pledge to provide Ukraine with 1 million rounds of artillery by the end of March, and any munitions from South Korea could help fill shortfalls. Ukraine is estimated to need at least 200,000 rounds a month.\n\nAn unnamed senior NATO official said anything that South Korea provides to help Ukraine defend itself would be welcome, Yonhap News agency reported.\n\nSouth Korea has 155-millimeter artillery shells that are the NATO standard used by Ukraine. The stock is estimated to be at over 3 million shells, Yonhap reported.\n\nSeoul may be less worried now about drawing down its inventory after seeing North Korea sending to Russia what Yoon's government believes could be nearly 5 million shells. These arms transfers translated into Kyiv's troops being outgunned by as much as 10-1 by President Vladimir Putin's forces as military aid to Ukraine was delayed in the U.S. Congress this year.\n\nSouth Korea could also consider sending 105 mm artillery shells, which have less range but are fired from howitzers that are lighter and more mobile, the Center for Strategic & International Studies said in a report in March. South Korea has as many as 3.4 million shells that can be used by Ukraine, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, countries bordering Russia have been buying weapons from the likes of South Korea's leading defense contractor, Hanwha Aerospace Co. Its tanks and howitzers are seen as less expensive than those from U.S. makers and able to defeat Russian systems.\n\nYoon has said any decision on sending weapons would depend on Russia's action. Lawmaker Kim Gunn, who served under Yoon as a chief nuclear envoy until February, said the threat to supply arms to Ukraine is leverage to deter Russia from providing military support to North Korea.\n\nOfficials in Seoul have indicated a red line would be material, particularly technology that enhances Kim's ability to make weapons of mass destruction. Putin has said he can't exclude providing Kim with high-precision weapons in response to Western military assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\"From Seoul's point of view, Russia's cooperation with North Korea is a direct threat to its national security,\" said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a senior fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center. She said it not only aids in advancing North Korea's weapons development but helps Pyongyang \"manage and even improve its national economy by reviving the munitions industry.\"\n\nLee, who worked as an analyst for the CIA's Open Source Enterprise, said South Korea has been able to deflect pressure by promoting other ways to contribute to NATO, such cybersecurity, and Seoul should move cautiously.\n\n\"Direct provision of weapons to Ukraine is a major step, and that decision should be made based on South Korea's national interest, which should also take into consideration its longer-term interest vis-a-vis Russia,\" she said.\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News&Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We expect the membership to be finalized soon.\"\n\nThe 17-member UNC was established in 1950 to enforce the armistice and serve as a headquarters for potential troop contributions by U.N. sending states in the case of a crisis.\n\nGermany provided medical assistance to South Korea from 1954-1959 but it was not recognized as a UNC member state because the armistice agreement was signed in July 1953.\n\nDuring the talks, Yoon and Scholz expressed \"grave concerns\" over North Korea's continued provocations and deepening cooperation with Russia through a sweeping military agreement last month, vowing to expand security cooperation between NATO and South Korea.

He said Russia should consider who is more important to Russia between South and North Korea.\n\nHe then warned that South Korea's possible provision of weapons to Ukraine depends on the level and content of cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded on the same day that Russia has never agreed with Yoon's approach and that Russia supports building good relations with all countries in the region. It looks like the two countries have equally exchanged punches.\n\nBut it is a huge disgrace to South Korea because of the big difference in status between the president of Korea and the Russian presidential office spokesperson in diplomatic relations.\n\nThe humiliation is regrettable in that the diplomatic disasters have repeated since the launch of the Yoon administration. In early February, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry disparaged Yoon's view as biased. In April last year, the Chinese foreign minister insulted that somebody playing with fire would burn to death, indicating Yoon.\n\nIn January last year, the Iranian Foreign Ministry bluntly criticized him for being ignorant about the situation in the Middle East.\n\nThe repeated diplomatic disasters and the deteriorated security situation on the Korean Peninsula raise concerns that foreign policy is not effectively implemented. Why is the Yoon administration subject to a series of diplomatic blasphemy? One reason might be that the Yoon government failed to distinguish between diplomacy and security, and was also excessively focused on security rather than diplomacy.\n\nThe concepts of foreign policy, diplomacy and security sound similar but differ. Foreign policy is an upper-level concept that refers to a strategy, guideline or action one country uses to exchange with another or international organization. Diplomacy is part of foreign policy and refers to resolving various tasks that arise in relations with foreign countries through dialogue and negotiation. Security is also a part of foreign policy, but it refers to a strategy or measure that protects the lives and property of the people against various types of external threats, including foreign military aggression.\n\nDiplomacy and security are the same in that they deal with common situations of foreign affairs, but the two are complementary in opposite directions. Since security aims to protect lives and property from external threats, it assumes the worst and emphasizes thorough preparedness. Diplomacy assumes the best, and emphasizes the efforts to seize opportunities to maximize the national interest through dialogue and negotiations with foreign countries.\n\nCompared to soccer, security officials specialized in defense, while diplomacy officials specialized in attack. Defenders and strikers are both soccer players but differ in their missions and roles. Diplomacy and security operate in the opposite direction but are directly connected, like one body. You cannot avoid a fiasco if you focus on only one thing and ignore the other.\n\nIf you look at the foreign policy of the Yoon Suk Yeol government, there are some movements related to security, but diplomacy is hard to find. For example, Yoon recently emphasized peace by force rather than words. However, maintaining peace can only be achieved by both diplomacy and security simultaneously.\n\nIf security is emphasized without diplomacy, the quality of security will decline because it increases external military threats. The same is true of the opposite case. So, there is no problem with emphasizing peace through strength. The problem is the rejection of peace by words. It is like a soccer coach who gives up attack and focuses only on defense. Without attack, there are no goals and no victories. Without diplomatic words, there is no peace and prosperity. If attack and defense, diplomacy, and security are not used in parallel with a sense of balance, soccer or foreign policy cannot avoid a complete failure.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol is attending the NATO summit again this time, and there is a problem in this area where diplomacy and security are not distinguished. Strengthening military preparedness against North Korean threats through cooperation with NATO is positive.\n\nHowever, we have to consider that the South Korea-US alliance possesses overwhelming war capabilities. North Korea, China and Russia will increase their military posture, judging that the strategic balance in Northeast Asia is destroyed as NATO becomes a military supporter of South Korea. The recent signing of a treaty between North Korea and Russia reflected this flow of atmosphere.\n\nTo address security concerns, it is natural to focus on increasing military power or securing alliances. However, there is no way out of security unrest if the military threat is not reduced through dialogues and negotiations with adversaries. As a result, the state's ability to reduce external threats affects the level of security posture.\n\nThrough negotiations, nations with excellent diplomatic capabilities drastically reduce the level of threats themselves. Since the end of the Cold War, all South Korean governments have tried to strengthen the alliance with the US and also improve relations with North Korea, China and Russia, laying structural foundations for peace and prosperity. However, since the inauguration of the Yoon Suk Yeol administration, the security situation has deteriorated due to unnecessary conflicts with North Korea, China, and Russia. The administration ignored that efforts to reduce threats through diplomacy are as crucial as strengthening military power or securing alliances.\n\nIf South Korea develops its foreign policy in a way that combines diplomacy and security with the geopolitical characteristics of a divided nation, the security situation in South Korea will shift in a positive direction. The dire situation in which the president is ridiculed and verbally abused by medium-level officials of foreign nations will also not happen again.\n\nWang Son-taek\n\nWang Son-taek is an adjunct professor at Sogang University.

He also pointed to its abundant resources.\n\n\"Despite the global crises, I believe this is an opportunity to deepen economic cooperation between our countries, including in key minerals and supply chains,\" said Yoon, who is in Uzbekistan on the final leg of a three-nation Central Asia tour that first took him to Turkmenistan and then to Kazakhstan.\n\nHe added: \"During this visit, we plan to discuss ways to substantively develop bilateral relations in various fields, such as energy and infrastructure, health care, climate and environment, science and technology, and education.\n\n\"Korea hopes to build a Central Asian hub for advanced science and technology with Uzbekistan.\"\n\nYoon also reflected on Mirziyoyev's commendable record as a reformer and bridge builder, saying: \"The Republic of Korea, which was once a country of absolute poverty, achieved economic and social development by opening up to the outside world, liberalising its economy, and fighting corruption in close cooperation with the international community. Building on this experience, the Republic of Korea supports Uzbekistan's efforts in implementing reforms and, being a special strategic partner, will continue to collaborate closely in the social, economic, and democratic development of Uzbekistan.\"\n\nHe also noted: \"Although geographically we are far from each other, nevertheless, we are connected by a long and friendly history of exchanging advanced scientific achievements and technologies.\"\n\nUzbekistan-South Korea trade moved up from $1.9bn in 2021 to $2.3bn in 2022 and 2023. South Korean investments in Uzbekistan have exceeded $7bn. Around 170,000 Koreans live in the country, Central Asia's most populous with a population of more than 35mn, while over 500 Korean companies operate there, including household names such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai. The two countries have also established several free economic zones, such as in Navoi and Angren.\n\nAccompanied by First Lady Kim Keon Hee and representatives from over 60 Korean companies, Yoon will on his visit attend a bilateral business forum. The visit is important to the launch of the Korea-Central Asia Initiative, also known as the K-Silk Road. Its programme includes efforts to secure the development of a trans-Korean railway (TKR) that would connect South Korea to the broader Eurasian Land Bridge, reducing overland shipping costs and boosting South Korea's export capabilities.\n\nOn the eve of the summit of the two presidents, Uzbekistan Railways signed an agreement with Hyundai Rotem for the purchase of electric trains.\n\nAlso on June 13, Uzbek Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov met with the heads of a number of leading Korean companies who will participate in the business forum. One of those was Shin Dong Ba, chairman of major conglomerate Lotte Group. Discussions centred on expanding joint projects.\n\nAt the meeting with the president of Exim Bank of Korea, Hee-sung Yoon, promising projects to expand cooperation in transport, green energy, mineral resources, education and medicine were discussed.\n\nAripov also held a meeting with the CEO of the Korea District Heating Corporation, Jeong Yongki. On the agenda were introducing cogeneration technologies and improving district heating systems, modernising existing plant and managing facilities according to the principles of public-private partnership (PPP).\n\nOn June 15, Yoon will visit the historic town of Samarkand on the ancient Silk Road.", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intellinews

Biden, Jr. briefly met today with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon of New Zealand, and Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles of Australia.\n\nThe leaders discussed the increasing connectivity between Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific security, noting that challenges in one region affect the other. They strongly condemned Russia's war against Ukraine, and each pledged to continue to support Ukraine in its self-defense. President Biden welcomed the courageous support to Ukraine offered by each of NATO's Indo-Pacific Partners. The leaders also strongly condemned the unlawful arms transfers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to Russia, which undermine peace and stability in both the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions. They expressed grave concern over the increasing military and economic cooperation between Russia and the DPRK, which violates multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions.

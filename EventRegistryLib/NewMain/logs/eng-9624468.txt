LeBron James praised Irving for his growth and skills. Irving faces the Boston Celtics with better emotional control.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks are set to compete for their first NBA title since 2011 when they face off against the Boston Celtics over the coming weeks.\n\nThe Mavericks' run to the NBA Finals was led by the superstar duo of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, with both dynamic guards stepping up their play to another level in the postseason.\n\nWhile Don\u010di\u0107 has spent all six seasons of his NBA career in Dallas, Irving is a newer addition, acquired at the trade deadline last year. Irving's initial run with the Mavericks didn't work out, with Dallas missing the postseason altogether in 2023, but given a full year to gel with his new teammates, Irving has blossomed into the best version of himself the NBA has seen since his initial run with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nIrving's former teammate LeBron James had high praise for the Mavericks guard ahead of the NBA Finals. Speaking with J.J. Redick on their podcast, \"Mind the Game,\" James explained how awestruck Irving would sometimes leave him on the court.\n\n\"I would call Kyrie 'The Wizard' all the time. All the time. There was nothing on a basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do,\" James said. \"Sitting here watching it, I'm so f -- -- happy and so f -- -- -- proud to watch his growth. At the same time, I'm so f -- -- -- mad that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nJames pointed to the opening game of the Western Conference finals, when Irving went off for 30 points, five rebounds, and four assists as a moment where he thought the rest of the basketball world woke up to the true potential of the Mavericks.\n\n\"What he did in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals, that was like, 'oh s -- , they may be able to not only win the Western Conference finals, they might be able to win the whole thing,' because of that wild card.\"\n\nJames saved his highest compliment for Irving for last.\n\n\"I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with absolutely none. He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen. He has the best gifts I've ever seen from any NBA player.\"\n\nIrving Has Also Spoken About How Much He's Grown in Recent Years The last time Irving faced the Celtics in the postseason, things got a bit testy.\n\nIn the 2022 postseason while a member of the Brooklyn Nets, Irving got into it with the crowd in Boston during a playoff series. Celtics fans still hold a bit of a grudge against Irving, as his short-lived stint in Boston did not go according to plan.\n\nBut speaking ahead of the NBA Finals, Irving said he's grown a lot since that last encounter.\n\n\"I think I'm better at consolidating kind of the emotions now or being aware of what it's going to be like. We call it animosity, we call it hate, we call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.' I mean, there are real, live circumstances going on in the world that are bigger than the basketball, kind of the competitive side of things and answering those questions.\"\n\nIt's clear that James sees the improvements that Irving has made as well.\n\nGame 1 of the NBA Finals tips off Thursday night in Boston.\n\nRelated Why the Golden State Warriors Are Still Poised for Success in 2024-25 Between their areas of strength, young talent and potential for offseason moves, here's why the Warriors are still poised for success in 2024-25.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lebron-kyrie.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

The two led the way in capturing the city of Cleveland its first championship in 52 years, winning the 2016 NBA Finals in a dramatic 3-1 comeback against the heavily favored Golden State Warriors, who had set the record for most regular-season wins (73) in NBA history that season.\n\nHowever, James and Irving split up one year later after Irving requested a trade and was ultimately sent to the Boston Celtics. A rift developed between the two at the time, but was later patched up. It was rumored that Irving could rejoin James on the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency in 2019, but he joined Kevin Durant on the Brooklyn Nets instead. Irving then reportedly attempted to force a trade to the Lakers in 2022 but eventually wound up with the Dallas Mavericks via another trade in 2023.\n\nRegardless of how their three-year run ended, James seems to dearly miss being Irving's teammate.\n\n\"I would call Kyrie 'the wizard' all the time. There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do, and sitting here watching it, I'm so f****** happy and so proud and to watch him continue his growth or whatever the case may be, and at the same time, I'm so f****** mad that I am not his running mate anymore,\" James said while laughing on the latest edition of the \"Mind the Game Pod w/LeBron James and JJ Redick.\" \"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card, that's like having a 'Draw 4' in your hand every time someone deals you cards in UNO.\"\n\nJames later opined that Irving is \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nThe Lakers reportedly tried one more time to land Irving by attempting to convince him to sign with them in free agency last summer at well below market value, but he ultimately re-signed with the Mavericks on a three-year, $126 million deal.\n\nBoth James and Irving have new star duos. James and Anthony Davis have been together for five seasons on the Lakers, with them winning the 2020 NBA Finals; Irving and Luka Don\u010di\u0107 have been paired together for the past year-plus on the Mavericks, leading them to the 2024 NBA Finals against the Celtics -- Irving's former team where he also had an acrimonious departure. That series begins with Game 1 in Boston on Thursday.\n\nIn the regular season, Irving averaged 25.6 points, 5.2 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game, while shooting 49.7/41.1/90.5.

The two star players paired up to bring the Cleveland Cavaliers their first franchise title over the Golden State Warriors in 2016. Irving has a chance to make more history with the Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals, and James revealed a roller coaster of emotions for his former teammates' opportunity.\n\n\"[I'm] so f**king happy...and to watch him continue his growth... and at the same time, I'm so f**king mad that I am not his running mate anymore... He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen,\" James revealed, via the Mind the Game podcast.\n\nJames continued to praise Irving, saying there is \"nothing he can't do,\" and describing him as a \"wizard on the basketball court.\" Furthermore, the Lakers forward drew an intriguing analogy to capture Irving's impact on the Mavericks amid the team's NBA Finals journey.\n\n\"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card, that's like having a 'draw four' in your hand every time someone deals you cards in UNO. Because he has the ability to [completely change the momentum of the game].\"\n\nJames alluded to Irving's stellar performance in Game 1 of the Mavs' Western Conference Finals matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Irving came alive in the second half and ended with 30 points, five rebounds, and four assists. Game 1 is not the only time the star guard has reached 30 or more points alongside Luka Doncic.\n\nIrving's shot-creating and ability to take over could allow the Mavericks to beat the odds and win their second franchise championship. James would know Irving's abilities, considering he watched him nail a Game 7 dagger that helped the Cavs beat the Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals.\n\nCan Irving make a similar impact against the Boston Celtics in 2024?\n\nWill Kyrie Irving prove Lakers' LeBron James right?\n\nLeBron James was arguably the best player in the NBA in 2016. Yet, he faced one of his toughest challenges that summer against Golden State. The 15-16 Warriors had come off a historical 73-9 season and were the favorites to repeat as Finals champions. The trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green wanted to drown the Cavaliers' hopes.\n\nJames did everything he could, but after his team went down 3-1, things looked grim. One of the reasons Cleveland was able to advance to the Finals and make a comeback against the Dubs was because of Kyrie Irving. In addition to his clutch shot-making, Irving put up the numbers to back his impact. He averaged 25.2 points and shot a red-hot 44 percent on three-pointers throughout the 2016 postseason.\n\nEight years later, Irving is putting up similar numbers with the Mavericks. The 32-year-old has averaged 22.8 points on 42.1 percent point accuracy through 17 playoff games. He has helped Dallas push their ceiling, and with Luka Doncic by his side, the sky is truly the limit.\n\nOf course, things will not be easy against their final opponent. The Boston Celtics arguably have the best starting five in the NBA. Thus, Irving and Dallas will need to lock in on both sides of the ball to come away victorious.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Why-LeBron-James-is-f-king-happy-mad-about-Kyrie-Irvings-NBA-Finals-trip.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

After clinching the championship in 2016, Irving continued as James' right-hand man but showed interest in becoming the main player on another team.\n\nAhead of the 2017-18 season, Irving was traded to the Boston Celtics, where he played for two seasons before moving to the Brooklyn Nets in free agency to form a superteam with Kevin Durant. After spending three and a half seasons in Brooklyn, he was traded to the Mavericks to join forces with Luka Doncic.\n\nNow paired with Doncic, whose playing style is reminiscent of James, Irving finds himself back in the NBA Finals - a stage he has been yearning to return to since his Cleveland days. Achieving this feat with a player akin to James speaks volumes about Irving's talent and prowess.\n\nMeanwhile, James has spent the last six seasons in Los Angeles, leading the Lakers to an NBA championship during the shortened 2019-20 season. Despite achieving his success away from Irving, he couldn't resist praising his former teammate once more. \"He's remarkable,\" James concluded.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jarrod_castillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jarrod Castillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u201320_Oklahoma_City_Thunder_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019\u201320 Oklahoma City Thunder season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article32962084.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_screenshot-2024-06-04-at-94118-pm.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Will Jayson Tatum and the Celtics surpass the Lakers for most titles won, or will Luka and the Mavs bring home Dallas' first championship since 2011?\n\nThe branches have branches, and the extensive roots come from all directions.\n\nWith his rebound from turbulent seasons for the Brooklyn Nets where his refusal to get the COVID-19 vaccine sidelined him for multiple games and his dissemination of anti-Semitic media earned him an eight-game suspension?\n\nWith him turning out to be the right star to play alongside MVP candidate Luka Doncic?\n\nWith LeBron James' extraordinary praise?\n\nWherever we start, Irving remains among the best players in the league - an elite shotmaker who has elevated the Mavericks.\n\n\"I would call Kyrie the wizard all the time,\" NBA star LeBron James said Tuesday on an Instagram post. \"There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do, and sitting here watching it, I'm so (expletive) happy and so proud. And to watch his growth, and at the same time, I'm so (expletive) mad that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nThen James added: \"He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nIrving is in his fourth NBA Finals, which starts Thursday (8:30 p.m. ET, ABC). \"So grateful to be here with my teammates,\" Irving said.\n\nHe played in his first three with the Cleveland Cavaliers (2015, 2016 and 2017), and his game-winning 3-pointer against Golden State in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals is one of the biggest made shots in Finals history.\n\nHe has played a major role in Dallas' season and the Mavs' Western Conference championship. He has rekindled his career and reshaped his story this season. And if Dallas wins the title, Irving will have played a major role.\n\nMORE: Jason Kidd won NBA title as a Mavericks player; now he tries to win as coach\n\nIrving brings thoughtfulness to the matchup against Boston.\n\n\"Definitely don't take this moment for granted because of how hard we had to work to get here and we had to earn our spot into the NBA Finals,\" Irving said, adding, \"And as a kid that's what you dream of getting to - the Finals and being able to play against the best of the best with the whole world watching.\"\n\nWhen the series starts, Irving is not welcomed in Boston, at least by Celtics fans. Following Cleveland's 2017 Finals appearance, Irving wanted a trade, and he ended up in Boston. He was supposed to be the missing piece that helped the Celtics, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown win a title.\n\nIrving was injured for the 2018 playoffs, and the Celtics lost to Cleveland in the conference finals, and Milwaukee eliminated Boston in the 2019 conference semifinals.\n\nInstead of re-signing with Boston - as he once indicated he wanted to do - he left for Brooklyn and a partnership with Kevin Durant. Irving said he enjoyed his time with the Celtics but \"I wasn't my best self during that time.\"\n\nIrving revealed that the death of his grandfather at the start of the 2018-19 season made him reconsider priorities and he wanted to be closer to family and friends in New Jersey.\n\n\"After he passed, basketball was the last thing on my mind,\" Irving said nearly five years ago. \"There was a facial expression that I carried around with me throughout the year. Didn't allow anyone to get close to me in that instance, and it really bothered me. I didn't take the necessary steps to get counseling or get therapy or anything to deal with someone that close to me dying. I've never dealt with that anything like that.\"\n\nHe also on Monday hinted at other reasons. \"I know in due time a lot of that full story will come out and when it's appropriate,\" Irving said.\n\nIt wasn't his only cryptic comment: \"When I was a little bit younger, I wanted to strive to be one of the best in the world, and that's all I thought about every single day. And that's why I had all my eggs in the basket. So there was no normal life outside the game of basketball other than doing what young NBA players do, which is getting into some stuff they shouldn't be getting into and being around people that don't necessarily reflect the moral values that you want to have embodying as a person.\"\n\nThe Nets' situation never worked out as expected on the court. It almost did. They were close to beating eventual champion Milwaukee in the East semis, but lost in seven games in 2021. Because of New York's vaccine mandate, Irving played in just 29 games in 2021-22, and at the beginning of the 2022-23 season, Irving publicized on social media an anti-Semitic \"documentary\" and initially declined to say he was anti-Semitic. The Nets and the league were furious.\n\nThe Nets called him \"unfit to be associated with the Brooklyn Nets.\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said, \"I am deeply disappointed that he has not offered an unqualified apology and more specifically denounced the vile and harmful content contained in the film he publicized.\"\n\nIrving eventually apologized, but by the trade deadline last season, Irving wanted out, and the Nets, not unhappily, obliged, trading him to Dallas. The Mavs took a low-grade risk. They gave up two players, a 2029 first-round draft picks and two second-round picks.\n\nThe Mavs missed the playoffs last season, but in 2023-24 Irving had an unappreciated season and just missed a spot in the respected 50-40-90 club. He shot 49.7% from the field, 41.1% on 3s and 90.5% on free throws and averaged 25.6 points, 5.2 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals. It was the fifth time in his career he averaged at least 25-5-5, and by the end of the regular season, the Mavs were among the best teams. Irving and Doncic excelled in the postseason, becoming the only backcourt pair to score 30 more points in the same game in a single playoffs.\n\nHe has the support of the Mavs' locker room, too. Doncic understands Irving's value to him and the team. Irving's ability alleviates pressure on Doncic making Doncic even more difficult to defend. The celebratory hug they shared after beating Minnesota in the conference finals revealed the appreciation.\n\n\"He brought that calmness to our team, to me, the maturity, and it's been unbelievable to have him on our team,\" Doncic said. \"Learning from him every day, positive energy always, just a blessing having him on our team.\"\n\nHumans are complicated, imperfect and conflicted.

Though the four-time MVP is excited about his former teammate's success, he recently admitted that he misses playing with him.\n\n\"I'm so f**king happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth,\" James said during the latest episode of his Mind The Game podcast with JJ Redick. \"At the same time, I'm so f**king mad at the same time that I'm not his running mate anymore.\" He spoke about how he calls Irving \"the wizard\" because there is \"nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do.\"\n\n\"I just remember those times,\" he continued in his celebratory rant about the Dallas Mavericks guard. \"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card, that's like having a Draw Four in your hand every time someone deals you cards in UNO. [...] 'Oh sh*t, Dallas may be able to not only win the Western Conference Finals, they might be able to win the whole thing [...] I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with absolutely none [...] He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks, led by Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic, prepare to take on the Boston Celtics in the 2024 NBA Finals on Thursday (June 6). LeBron James' Los Angeles Lakers, on the other hand, were ousted in the first round by the defending champions, the Denver Nuggets, in five games. James hasn't made an NBA Finals since leading the Lakers to a championship victory in 2020, the same year Kobe Bryant passed away.\n\nIrving, on the other hand, hasn't been back to the NBA Finals since 2017 when he played with James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Together, the duo led the Cavs to three straight NBA Finals from 2015 to 2017, all against the Golden State Warriors. They lost in 2015 and the next year they made history as the first team to overcome a 3-1 deficit and defeat Golden State in seven games.\n\nIrving is lauded as the hero in that series for his game-winning three-point shot in the final seconds of the fourth quarter. In 2017, they lost in five games to a strengthened Warriors team that added Kevin Durant to their roster. That following summer, the New Jersey hooper shocked the world and requested a trade from the Cavs, which was granted, as he was sent to the Boston Celtics.\n\nLeBron James sought a reunion with Kyrie Irving as recently as last NBA season. ESPN reported that the Los Angeles Lakers offered Russell Westbrook and two future first-round picks to Irving's former team the Brooklyn Nets, which was declined. Irving was ultimately traded to the Dallas Mavericks, where he is now thriving.\n\n\"I can't sit here and say I'm not disappointed on not being able to land such a talent, but [also] someone that I had great chemistry with, and know I got great chemistry with on the floor, that can help you win championships, in my mind, in my eyes,\" James told ESPN in February 2023.", "source": {"uri": "vibe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vibe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "armon_sadler@vibe.com", "name": "Armon Sadler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-2024-06-05T121818.703.png?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1267, "textEnd": 1273}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Irving praises the Mavericks' organization and credits their support and positive culture for his growth as a leader. Irving's image has transformed positively during the 2024 playoffs, showcasing his joy, freedom, and potential for a second championship.\n\nDallas Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving exuded an inner peace as he addressed the media on Monday during Irving's lead-up interview to the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nThe interview turned into somewhat of a career retrospective for Irving, 32, who has played for four franchises in his Hall of Fame career. When Irving steps onto the parquet floor inside TD Garden on Thursday evening for Game 1 of the Finals, it will mark his fourth appearance in an NBA Finals in 13 seasons played, an inconvenient figure for those who have accused Irving of detracting from winning in the past.\n\nAmong the many personal reflections that Irving expressed on Monday, perhaps the most pertinent was the notion that, in Irving's eyes, his stint with the Mavericks has been the best part of his entire career, as Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports detailed.\n\nSuch was quite a statement coming from a player who has already won an NBA Finals in 2016 playing alongside LeBron James, not to mention the fact that it was Irving himself who hit perhaps the most iconic shot in NBA Finals history to clinch Cleveland's historic victory, immortalizing a then 24-year-old Irving.\n\n\"This has been the greatest ... portion of my career. To be able to now give wisdom and also speak from a place of experience. When you're a young person, again, you're trying to speed through life, you're trying to get through everything.\" - Kyrie Irving\n\nFor Irving, greatness in Dallas has been about more than hitting shots. Rather, Irving's growing capacity as a leader has given him an added fulfillment that he never experienced as a younger player in Cleveland.\n\nIrving's thoughts on coming into the NBA at the tender age of 19, and all the expectations and pressures that came with this reality, spoke to more than just his own history but to the difficulty that many impossibly young NBA players face in having to mature under the spotlight.\n\n\"I think sometimes people still saw me as the young man coming into the league like as if I don't have other responsibilities and other things that matter to me ... So I think that's been part of the evolution of just helping people realize that I'm matured.\" -Kyrie Irving\n\nIn speaking candidly about his time spent in Boston and Brooklyn, Irving alluded to the sense that his leadership skills were still under construction during those years and that only now in Dallas has his identity as a leading voice fully bloomed.\n\nThe 4 Eras of Kyrie Irving\n\nCategory\n\nCLE\n\nBOS\n\nBKN\n\nDAL\n\nSeasons played\n\n6\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n\nTenure\n\n2011-17\n\n2017-19\n\n2019-22\n\n2022-present\n\nReg. season PPG\n\n21.6\n\n27.1\n\n24.1\n\n26.0\n\nReg. season record\n\n200-181\n\n78-49\n\n82-61\n\n47-31\n\nPlayoff PPG\n\n23.9\n\n21.3\n\n22.2\n\n22.8\n\nPlayoff record\n\n39-13\n\n5-4\n\n6-7\n\n12-5\n\nNBA Finals apps.\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nKyrie Irving Shows Mavericks Organization Love Irving had plenty of positive things to say about his current team\n\nIrving's talent as a leader is a testament to his own personality and strength, but also to the organization that has empowered him. Irving did much on Monday to praise the Mavericks organization for its culture, specifically general manager Nico Harrison and head coach Jason Kidd, who have been instrumental in creating opportunities for Irving to lead.\n\n\"[Dallas] is a supportive environment, and there's a lot of energy positivity ... it's all about organizational structure, and it's all about how you treat your veterans. It's all about how you treat your star players. It's all about how you treat people with respect.\" - Kyrie Irving\n\nThere is no doubt that Irving has found a peace in Dallas that has alluded him in recent years. It is not only Irving's calm demeanor which belies an inner happiness and tranquility, but also his performance on the court, which has lately reached, in some people's view, its highest level in Irving's career.\n\nIrving's rehabilitated image in the eyes of the national basketball media has been one of the most interesting narratives of the 2024 playoffs. Less than two years ago, Irving found himself stuck in a whirlwind of controversy as he navigated a suspension doled out by the Brooklyn Nets for Irving's engagement with antisemitic material online.\n\nAs Irving now finds himself face-to-face with a potential second NBA championship ring, all of his controversies appear to be remnants of a deep past. He is playing with joy and freedom, and he is playing for a franchise that, by giving Irving a second chance when others would not, has been handsomely rewarded for its faith.\n\nIrving's legacy has completely changed over the past six months, and an NBA title in the next two weeks would only add to his legend.\n\nRelated LeBron James Praises Kyrie Irving As a 'Gifted Player' LeBron James is proud of how his former teammate has developed with the Mavericks.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-27-may-2024-01-30-pm-4340.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball. The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nIrving appears to have found a stable basketball environment on Dallas head coach Jason Kidd's roster after burning his bridges in Cleveland, Boston and Brooklyn. After shooting his way out of Cleveland and out from under colossal shadow of LeBron James, Irving was given a savior's welcome when he came to Boston.\n\nIrving appeared to be the missing piece the Celtics needed while coach Brad Stevens was building his program around rising young stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Irving appeared to be on solid standing with his teammates, but his relationship with the Boston fans soured by the end of the 2019 season.\n\nNo tears were shed on Causeway Street when Irving decamped for Brooklyn, where his stay in the big borough ended the same way it did in Cleveland and Boston. Cleveland, Boston and Brooklyn are the NBA venues where Irving is the most vilified player on the floor. The bad feelings of betrayal die hard and that malignancy that surrounds Irving will take on a greater dimension under the hot lights of the NBA Finals.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, I've experienced Boston twofold,\" said Irving. \"My first few years being in the NBA playing for the Cavs, then coming here to Boston, then being right down the street in Brooklyn, now being here in the Finals playing against them in a potential four-to-seven game series.\n\n\"You just got to breathe through it. To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions, what they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it.\"\n\nFor two seasons, Irving presided over the budding Celtics nucleus that has gotten them to this point. Irving had friends in the Celtics' locker room where he was respected as a person and admired as a basketball player. Four seasons and one global pandemic later, Irving is genuinely impressed by what has become of his former teammates and their young coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\n\"Playing against my former brothers, yeah, no, I'm excited,\" said Irving. \"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So, I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\n\n\"They have a great team over there, led by a great coach. So, we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough series. They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more.\n\n\"This is what I've been preparing for since last summer or when our season ended last year of putting in the time to prepare for moments like this.\"\n\nIrving has been a force in the playoffs as the Mavericks outlasted the Clippers, Thunder and Timberwolves in the Western Conference. In 17 postseason games, Irving has averaged 40.2 minutes, 22.8 points, 5.2 assists and 3.9 boards per game. Irving scored 36 points in 40 minutes in the closeout game against the Timberwolves.\n\nBrown will likely find himself opposite Irving and All-NBA first team point guard Luka Doncic at some point. Brown considered Irving a good teammate, but forces beyond their control placed them on the same stage in opposite camps.\n\n\"I think it was great,\" said Brown. \"Definitely learned a lot from Kyrie while he was here. It's been great to see his journey, see where he's at, all the stuff he's going through, stuff like that, to be where he's at it's amazing, it's dope to see.\n\n\"How to stop him? That's a great player over there, so it's going to be a full-team effort. Him and Luka. Making sure we're alert, making sure we're back in transition, and do the best we can.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rich_thompson@bostonherald.com", "name": "Rich Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/finalsms004.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Reddick, James was asked about his favorite part about Irving as a player and gushed about the influence the Dallas Mavericks guard can have in a game.\n\nThe 32-year-old Irving, an eight-time NBA All-Star, has played for the Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets and now Mavericks since an Aug. 2017 trade from the Cavaliers. His production has improved but this will be his first trip back to the NBA Finals having only played 22 playoff games since leaving Cleveland.\n\nDespite the breakup, James has watched Irving flourish elsewhere and remained proud of his former teammate's game.\n\nReddick chimed in expressing his own admiration of Irving's game, calling it \"aesthetically pleasing\" and \"beautiful.\"\n\nOne attribute of Irving's that James is fond of is his ability to shoot with his weak hand. James said that if Irving is having an off night with his right hand he will be use his left for the rest of the game.\n\nThose talents has helped Irving lead the Mavericks to the NBA Finals in his first full season in Dallas.\n\nIrving and the Mavericks will take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of the NBA Finals Thursday night (8:30 p.m. ET; ABC) .", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3jq5anhYsscQefpSjztJ4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/d4fadca0-2290-11ef-ba57-25a5797180e9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-", "textStart": 772, "textEnd": 781}], "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

I just remember those times.\"\n\nIrving, 32, is back in the NBA Finals for the first time since 2017, when he, James and the Clevland Cavaliers lost to the Golden State Warriors. The Boston Celtics host Irving's Dallas Mavericks in Thursday's Game 1. James and Irving played in Cleveland together for three seasons, from 2014 to 2017, winning a championship in 2016 and making three straight finals.\n\n\"I would call Kyrie 'The Wizard' all the time,\" James said of their time together. \"There was nothing on a basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do.\"\n\nJames, previewing the Celtics-Mavericks championship series with Redick, referred to Irving as the \"ultimate wildcard.\"\n\n\"It's like having a Draw 4 in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno,\" James said.\n\nThrough 17 playoff games, Irving is averaging 22.8 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.2 steals. The eight-time All-Star is shooting 48.5 percent overall and 42.1 percent on 3s.\n\nJames noted that Irving's performance in the first half against the Minnesota Timberwolves of Game 1 of the Western Conference finals -- when Irving scored 24 of his 30 points -- was the first time he believed that the Mavericks had the potential to win the championship.\n\n\"That was like, 'Oh, s -- , Dallas may be able to not only win the Western Conference finals, they might be able to win the whole thing,'\" James said. \"Because of that (Irving) wildcard. I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with none, because it's just ... He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nThis is not the first time James has acknowledged his preference to reunite with Irving. James made his opinion clear when asked days before the 2023 trade deadline if Irving, who had just requested a trade from Brooklyn, would boost the Lakers' title chances.\n\n\"Obviously, that's a -- what's the word you use -- 'duh' question when you talk about a player like that,\" James said then.\n\nThe Lakers were one of several teams to pursue Irving at the 2023 trade deadline. They offered the Nets a package including Russell Westbrook and two future first-round picks in 2027 and 2029, The Athletic reported then. The primary concern from the Lakers' end, at the time, was Irving's impending free agency and his potential departure during the 2023 offseason. The Lakers wanted Irving to agree to a two-year extension, but he preferred to test free agency and sign a longer-term deal.\n\nShortly after Irving was dealt to Dallas for a package that included Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, an unprotected first-round pick in 2029 and two second-round picks, James tweeted, \"Maybe it's me,\" which almost certainly was in direct reference to Irving landing elsewhere.\n\nIrving requested a trade out of Cleveland in the summer of 2017 and was dealt to the Celtics. He and James reconnected a couple of seasons later when Irving reached out to James for advice about how to lead the Celtics.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jovan_buha@nytimes.com", "name": "Jovan Buha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Dinwiddie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Dinwiddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_Finney-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dorian Finney-Smith"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/04161515/gettyimages-2150273183-594x594-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Placing another star guard beside Luka Doncic didn't pay immediate dividends and it was hard to see a path from missing the play-in game to competing for a title in just one season.\n\nDallas has since made a number of cagey moves to quickly build a title contender from drafting Dereck Lively II in the lottery, to signing Derrick Jones Jr. in free agency to acquiring P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford from the Charlotte Hornets and Washington Wizards in February.\n\nAll these moves helped Dallas reach this point. But make no mistake, the biggest and most impactful move was bringing Irving to Dallas when his value and standing in the NBA was never lower. Without Irving buying in on and off the court, none of the other moves work with the same effectiveness.\n\nNow it's only fitting that Irving returns to the place where his career began to take a turn for the worse.\n\nA journey of growth\n\nAfter falling to the Kevin Durant-led Golden State Warriors in the 2017 Finals, Irving asked out of Cleveland and eventually landed with the Boston Celtics. At the time it was a no-brainer move for the Celtics as they upgraded over Isaiah Thomas for the taller and more talented Irving.\n\nIrving's tenure in Boston wasn't as problematic as his stint in Brooklyn, but when he left the Celtics in free agency there was a prevailing feeling that not only did Boston underachieve, but Irving could've been the biggest reason for it. The Celtics had two playoff runs while Irving was there.\n\nIn the first run, Irving was hurt and the Celtics still made the Eastern Conference finals. The next year Irving was available, but Boston crumbled in the playoffs against Milwaukee and Irving was gone soon.\n\nIt was at that point that Irving began to develop a reputation of being a bad teammate, which was only heightened with the repeated missteps in Brooklyn. However, much time has passed since then and Irving is nowhere near the same player or person he was.\n\nA big portion of that growth he credits to his time in Boston where he was thrust into a leadership role with such a young team.\n\n\"We had a great opportunity to do some special things, but it was cut short based on personal reasons on my end,\" Irving said. \"The one thing I look back on in my time in Boston, the greatest thing I learned was being able to manage not only my emotions, but just what's going on on a day to day basis as a leader of a team.\"\n\nIrving said it was difficult to leave players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford and Marcus Smart (now with the Grizzlies) as they were able to form real bonds during his time with the Celtics.\n\nHe was in the midst of his own spiritual journey that included him diving deeper into his heritage and that of his parents plus the natural maturation process even young man goes through. The conversation regarding his departure stung Irving and learning to let go was a major lesson he took from the fallout these past few seasons.\n\n\"I didn't mind after a few years of taking the brunt of the blame,\" Irving said. \"I'm one of the best players in the world, so I know what comes with that fair criticism. But a little more grace could've been extended my way especially with what I was dealing with at the time as a human being.\"\n\nWhat followed in Brooklyn has been well documented. Injury riddled seasons, a suspension for posting a link to a documentary with anti-semitic views and missing games due to his stance on people \"losing their jobs\" because of the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic.\n\nThe weight of the past few seasons played out in the 2022 playoffs when Irving and the Nets met the Celtics in the first round and Irving clashed with a fan resulting in him throwing up the middle finger and being fined $50,000 for the gesture. It's not something this version of Irving is proud of.\n\n\"The last time in Boston when everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (expletive), that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete,\" Irving said. \"It wasn't a great reflection to the young generation on controlling your emotions no matter what they're yelling at you.\n\n\"I've been able to grow since then. Of course it's going to be a hectic environment and I see it as a healthy relationship I have with the fans. I almost think about a gladiator winning the crowd over, it's good to hear the T.D. Garden silent when you're playing well.\"\n\nThat type of perspective isn't something Irving had just a few years ago, but now that he has it he also has the necessary emotional tools to withstand the outside noise. Irving said he's ready to take the brunt of the yells and remarks from the Boston fanbase and it's that type of attitude that has helped Irving win over the Dallas locker room.\n\n\"He's been able to be a vocal leader,\" Mavs forward P.J. Washington said. \"He's been in every position when it comes to the NBA, he's an icon. So everybody looks up to him and everybody listens when he talks. Just him being able to calm everybody down and be a great leader, a great vet I think it's been good for all of us.\"\n\nTo become the person he is now wasn't as simple as just letting the days go by while he grew older. Irving put in the work, though he actually got some help from the state of Texas.\n\nThe impact of Dallas\n\nIt's after Game 3 of the Western Conference finals and the Dallas Mavericks all but know they'll be playing in the NBA Finals soon. Irving is coming off a spectacular performance where he scored 33 points to help lead Dallas to 116-107 win.\n\nIrving is in a particularly good mood as expected, with a cheerful demeanor and his wife and children off to the side. Irving is asked how much the Dallas organization and the community at large means to him.\n\nIn typical Irving fashion, he ponders for a second and then offers a thoughtful, emotional answer.\n\n\"I feel like it's a great chapter being written right now, I'm enjoying every step of the way,\" Irving said. \"I'm enjoying the hot weather right now. I'm enjoying the Dallas community and the fans here. I've talked about how I felt embraced, but I think it goes a little deeper than that.\n\n\"It's really helped me grow as a human being and find my peace out here. It's good to breathe fresh air and get outside. Seasonal depression when you're growing up north. I've been in three cold cities, but you come out here you're able to get outside and ground yourself a little bit more.\"\n\nThe gray skies and concrete jungle feel of Boston and New York City can wear on any person, especially one as in tune with his emotions as Irving.\n\nAs much Irving has enjoyed the constant sunshine, his family is enjoying it even more.\n\n\"You watch your kids run outside, your wife is happy,\" Irving says with a smile. \"You know what they say about a happy wife? A happy life. I don't take those things for granted, just being able to grow and understand all these things don't happen without a lot of the work that goes unseen. The inner work, the spiritual work and enjoying the game and putting that in perspective.\"\n\nIt's at that moment that Irving's wife enters the press conference from the side with one child in her arms and the other clinging to her leg staring intently at their father finishing up his press conference. They're a big reason Irving has found his maturity and peace.\n\nThis is who Irving is now. A mature family man, that still has these intriguing and different views on everything from basketball to religion and mental health.\n\n\"What he's doing is rewriting his journey,\" coach Jason Kidd said earlier this postseason. \"It's a beautiful thing what he's doing. He's worldly, which is a beautiful thing too. Most of us aren't, we're stuck in our sport. He can talk about other things and sometimes that scares people.\"\n\nNow the only terror Irving is inflicting is on opposing defenses while still being true to himself and maintaining the emotions that make him the man and the player he is today. Irving is the best version of himself and as a result the Mavericks are also the best version of themselves.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth

Game 1 tips off Thursday night in Boston (8:30 p.m., ABC).\n\n\"I'm so f---ing happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth,\" James told his co-host, JJ Redick, on an episode of their \"Mind the Game\" podcast released Tuesday, per ESPN. \"I'm so f---ing mad at the same time that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nJames and Irving, of course, won an NBA championship together with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, and reached the Finals a year later, losing to Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors.\n\n\"I just remember those times,\" James said.\n\nIrving, the West Orange, N.J. native once viewed by many in the NBA as \"damaged property\" due to off-the-court situations like his refusal to get vaccinated for COVID-19 and his retweeting of a film with anti-Semitic tropes, has now rehabilitated his image and can win a second NBA championship as the Robin to Luka Doncic's Batman.\n\nAfter being traded to the Mavericks by the Brooklyn Nets in 2023, Irving was then linked to James and the Lakers in free agency, but there were no takers and he signed a three-year, $120-million deal with Dallas.\n\nNow the trade is suddenly being viewed as one of the best -- if not the best -- in recent memory because Irving has flourished alongside Doncic, an MVP finalist. Through the first three rounds of the playoffs, Irving is averaging 23.8 points, 5.2 assists and 3.9 rebounds.\n\n\"I can't sit here and say I'm not disappointed on not being able to land such a talent, but [also] someone that I had great chemistry with, and know I got great chemistry with on the floor, that can help you win championships, in my mind, in my eyes,\" James told ESPN's Michael Wilbon last February.\n\nMeantime, Irving has seemingly matured off the court. He will return to Boston, another team from which he demanded a trade, with a more self-aware sense of how he behaved during his last playoff appearance there.\n\nThe Nets eliminated the Celtics in five games in the 2021 first round and then got swept in the first round a year later. That ended up being Irving's final postseason appearance for Brooklyn.\n\n\"I think I'm better at consolidating kind of the emotions now or being aware of what it's going to be like,\" Irving told reporters this week. \"We call it animosity, we call it hate, we call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.' I mean, there are real, live circumstances going on in the world that are bigger than the basketball, kind of the competitive side of things and answering those questions\n\n\"But I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s--- a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level. It wasn't a great reflection on my end towards the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment, no matter what people are yelling at you.\"\n\nIf people are yelling at Irving this week, it likely means he and the Mavericks are doing damage in Boston. Very few people expected the No. 5 Mavericks to come out of the West, which was loaded with the reigning NBA champioon Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nBut now it is Irving, Doncic and the Mavericks who have a chance to make history as perhaps the most unlikely team to win an NBA championship in recent memory.\n\nAnd LeBron believes his old running buddy gives Dallas a legitimate shot to upset the favored Celtics.\n\n\"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card,\" James said. \"It's like having a Draw 4 in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno.\"\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

The Mavericks won 124-103, taking the series 4-1 and moving on to the NBA Finals. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)\n\nBefore jilting Boston fans by signing with the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019, Irving was already a polarizing player.\n\nThen came the COVID-19 pandemic and Irving's refusal to get vaccinated, which meant he couldn't play home games for Brooklyn because of New York City's vaccine mandate for employees.\n\nNext was Irving's social media post of a link to a movie containing antisemitic material, which led to a suspension from the Nets and the end of his longtime business relationship with Nike.\n\nUltimately, Irving asked out of Brooklyn, and he and Durant were traded days apart last year, giving Irving a new co-star in Mavs point guard Luka Doncic.\n\nThe former No. 1 overall pick out of Duke had never been anywhere near Texas in his career but was greeted by two familiar faces. Mavs general manager Nico Harrison used to work for Nike, and coach Jason Kidd was the point guard of the then-New Jersey Nets when Irving was growing up in that area.\n\nIrving caught up with the team in Los Angeles after the trade, and the Mavericks won their first two games with him.\n\n\"You could see the smile,\" Kidd said. \"You could see the relief, or you could see that he was ready to have fun and play the game that he loves.\"\n\nThe partial season together didn't work out for Irving and Doncic. Dallas missed the playoffs. The first full season together was what the Mavs expected when they pulled off Harrison's first blockbuster trade.\n\nA late-season surge lifted the Mavs to fifth in the West, although they've been the lower seed throughout these playoffs.\n\nDallas beat the Los Angeles Clippers in six games in the first round, ousting Tyronn Lue, Irving's coach from his championship season alongside LeBron James in Cleveland in 2016.\n\n\"He\u00b4s very, very patient,\" Lue said after that series of the difference between the Irving he coached and today's version. \"You couldn\u00b4t get this Kyrie when I had him. He wants to kill you every moment, every second. But now you can see, he\u00b4s just letting the game come to him.\"\n\nThe Mavs beat top-seeded Oklahoma City in six games before knocking out No. 3 Minnesota in five games in the Western Conference finals, the clincher giving Dallas a five-game road winning streak in the playoffs.\n\n\"I feel like it\u00b4s a great chapter that\u00b4s being written right now,\" Irving said. \"I\u00b4m enjoying every step of the way. I\u00b4m not taking anything for granted. I\u00b4m enjoying the hot weather right now. I\u00b4m enjoying the Dallas community. We talked about this early in the season, just how much I felt embraced.\"\n\nIrving went on to say it went deeper than that, reminding reporters of an entire career spent in the other conference.\n\n\"Seasonal depression is real when you\u00b4re growing up in the north,\" Irving said. \"I spent 12 years in the Eastern Conference in three cold cities that deal with four seasons. So you come out here and you\u00b4re able to get outside and ground yourself a little bit more and spend some time with your family. Watch your kids run outside.\"\n\nIrving and Doncic have at least another season together. Irving has a player option for 2025-26, Doncic for the season after that.\n\nKidd believes a preseason trip to Madrid, where Doncic grew as a teenaged pro in the EuroLeague, helped the two superstars bond.\n\nNow, winning is cementing that bond, one of the most poignant moments for the pair coming in the final seconds of Game 3 against the Timberwolves, after the Mavs knew they had clinched a 3-0 lead.\n\n\"When we were winning by nine on that last possession, I told (Irving), 'I\u00b4m tired,\u00b4 and he told me, 'That\u00b4s the way it\u00b4s supposed to be,\u00b4\" Doncic said. \"He brought the calmness to the team and to me. He brought the maturity. I\u00b4m learning from him every day.\"\n\nThere might not have been many teammates lining up to say those things in Irving's first three stops, and the magnitude looms larger with the words coming from the face of the Dallas franchise.\n\nEven though his relationships with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and some of his other former Boston teammates are fine, Irving believes he is a better teammate now than he was then.\n\n\"The greatest thing I learned from Boston was just being able to manage not only my emotions, but just what\u00b4s going on on a day-to-day basis of being a leader of a team or being one of the leaders and having young guys around you that have their own goals,\" Irving said. \"You have to learn how to put the big picture first.\"\n\nA more introspective Irving is on the big stage again, and knows what's coming from the crowd in Boston.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\n\nDallas Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving answers questions during a news conference after the Mavericks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 5 of the NBA basketball Western Conference finals, Thursday, May 30, 2024, in Minneapolis.

Irving's time in Boston did not end in favorable fashion for anyone involved. Kyrie knows that fans are likely going to boo him, but he's always ready for a challenge.\n\n\"I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that,\" Irving said of playing in Boston while speaking to reporters on Monday. \"I've been able to grown since then. Of course it's going to be a hectic environment. I'm looking forward to it. I see it as a healthy relationship to have with the fans.\"\n\nIrving has played well in the NBA postseason. There were times during the 2024 playoffs where he was not quite as aggressive on offense, though. With the environment expected to be \"hectic\", as Irving said, one has to imagine he will enter the series with some added motivation.\n\nAnd when great scorers like Kyrie Irving have any extra motivation, all defenses can do is cross their fingers and hope he misses some shots. He may end up having multiple 40-point games in the series, but look for at least one huge offensive explosion on the road from the Mavs star.\n\nIrving plays lockdown defense all series long\n\nAnother area where added motivation can be channeled is on the defensive end of the floor. Irving has played well on defense in the postseason so far. It would not be surprising to see Kyrie take another step forward on that end of the floor during the series.\n\nIn the end, Kyrie is known for his offensive dominance. That is the part of his game that receives the attention.\n\nOne important note to make is that Irving said he's \"healthy\" heading into this year's NBA Finals. As a result, his defensive productivity will likely see an increase.\n\nDallas will need an all-around respectable defensive effort to upset Boston. The Celtics feature the offensive potential to run away with games if opposing defenses struggle to make impactful plays. Irving understands, so we can expect him to step up and have a big series on both ends of the floor.\n\nKyrie makes at least one game-winning shot\n\nMotivation, motivation, motivation. It's a word we have probably used too much but it's the perfect way to describe what we will see from Kyrie Irving against the Celtics in the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Mavericks have two closers on the roster in Irving and Luka Doncic. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are terrific players, but I would take Irving and Doncic as the preferred duo to close games.\n\nEither player can make a game-winning shot, but the prediction here is that Kyrie will connect on at least one attempt to send Mavericks fans home happy.\n\nThe NBA Finals is going to be a back-and-forth series. But I believe Kyrie Irving is poised to perform at an elite level. And if you don't believe me, maybe you will have more faith based on what former NBA star Jamal Crawford recently said about Kyrie.\n\n\"He's definitely going to average 25 (points per game in the NBA Finals)... I think if Dallas wins this series, I think this championship can mean more to Kyrie than the one he got in Cleveland,\" Crawford said on Bully Ball, via All the Smoke Productions.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_mistretta@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Joey Mistretta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kyrie-Irving-bold-predictions-for-Mavericks-vs.-Celtics-NBA-Finals.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

It ultimately led to a run of three consecutive NBA Finals appearances and a Larry O'Brien Trophy for the two in Cleveland.\n\nAs you likely already know, this marriage devolved big time. It led to Irving requesting a trade from Cleveland following the 2016-17 season. He eventually landed with the aforementioned Celtics. The rest is pretty much history.\n\nRelated: Ranking the 10-best NBA Finals series ever\n\nIt sure does seem that any bad feelings that came with Irving's departure from Cleveland in 2017 has faded. James was openly recruiting him to Southern California last summer.\n\nHe's now praising Irving while showing some anger that the two are no longer teammates.\n\n\"I'm so f**king happy, and so proud, to watch him continue his growth and whatever the case may be. And at the same time, I'm so f**king mad at the same time that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nJames expanded on what he's seen from Irving since the star guard made his way to Dallas midway through last season.\n\n\"I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with absolutely none,\" James said. \"He is the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen. He has the best gifts I've ever seen of any NBA player.\"\n\nIrving, 32, seems to have found a home with Luka Doncic in Big D after drama-filled stays with the Cavaliers, Celtics and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nHe was absolutely brilliant in his first full regular season with the Mavericks, averaging 25.6 points to go with 5.0 rebounds and 5.2 assists. Irving also shot 50% from the field, including 41% from three-point range.\n\nAs for the Lakers, they are coming off a first-round exit at the hands of the Denver Nuggets in the NBA Playoffs.

LeBron James wanted to reunite with the guy he won a ring with in Cleveland, Irving wanted it, but the two teams could not agree on a deal. Ultimately, Irving ended up traded to Dallas (and while the Lakers speculated last summer about a trade for Irving with the Mavericks, Dallas had no real interest).\n\nThat trade to Dallas worked out for Irving. With he and his Mavericks tipping off the NBA Finals on Thursday night and Irving looking like a mature elder statesman, LeBron had the highest praise for Irving on the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron and J.J. Redick that dropped Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm so f****** happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth. I'm so f****** mad at the same time that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nLeBron also referenced Irving scoring 24 points in the first half of Game 1 against the vaunted Minnesota Timberwolves defense.\n\n\"That was like, 'Oh s***, Dallas may be able to not only win the Western Conference finals, they might be able to win the whole thing. Because of that [Irving as a] wild card. ... He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nHigh praise -- and Irving will have to live up to it if Dallas is going to upset Boston and become NBA champions. Most likely, Boston will start with Jaylen Brown on Luka Doncic and Jrue Holiday on Irving -- and Holiday has had success in the past at least keeping Irving in check (Irving is too skilled to be stopped, but Holiday slows him and makes him work for his points). Boston's five-out offense is going to get points against the Mavericks. The challenge for Dallas is for their offense to keep up, and that starts with Irving.\n\nIrving is locked in with Dallas (one more season at $41 million, then a player option for 2025-26 at nearly $44 million), and he's at the heart of their chances to win a title in the next couple of years with Luka Doncic entering his prime. Irving has been a model teammate and citizen in Dallas, and seems comfortable and happy there.\n\nFor LeBron, all he can do is watch and imagine what might have been.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e053048/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4413x2482+0+230/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F91%2Fb3%2F2ece882343af8a65d0889c7673ad%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1813808872", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Reflecting on his time with the Celtics, Irving explained that he would not be the man he is today without having experienced his time there.\n\n\"I would not be here without Boston, literally and figuratively just because without me going through what I went through here, I would not be who I am today,\" said Irving in a chat with ESPN's Malika Andrews.\n\nIrving, age 32, did not hide from his controversial past. In fact, he was open and honest about his \"ups and downs\" with the franchise and has come to embrace it as a part of his learning process.\n\n\"I'm grateful that I have history here,\" said Kyrie. \"But I've accepted it and I think that's the most beautiful part about this journey.\"\n\nThe 8x NBA All-Star went on to say that he's found closure with his past and has absolved anyone from blame for his previous decisions.\n\n\"It's just accepting what I've gone through, who I was, forgiving that person, forgiving myself. I've done my best not to play the blame game,\" said Irving. \"It's so easy to blame others or blame what's going on outside of you but once you go inside and you figure out who you are it's pretty easy to navigate.\"\n\nIn two seasons for the Celtics, just 127 games, Irving delivered on the court with averages of 24.1 points, 6.1 assists, and 4.4 rebounds per game on 48% shooting. The farthest the Celtics ever got under his watch was the East Semi-Finals and by the time he left in 2019, the entire situation had become borderline toxic.\n\nBetween calling out his own teammates, distancing himself in the locker room, and making false promises to the fans, it's no wonder why the fans in Boston still hold a grudge against the 8x All-Star and it's expected to get loud every time he touches the ball.\n\nKyrie Irving Says He's Happy With The Mavericks\n\nAlongside Luka Doncic, Kyrie has found success with the Mavericks and he says that he's here to stay. Despite his connection with LeBron James and his ties to the Celtics and Nets, Irving is fully committed to his new team and wherever they go from here.\n\n\"The future is still being written, said Irving. \"But I can tell you that with all the extensions that are going around... I don't mind being complimentary if we're gonna continue to put this band together... I am enjoying my time here [with the Mavs].\"\n\nWith Luka Doncic running the show, Irving has taken on more of a sidekick role for the Mavericks, similar to how it was with LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nBut as the Mavericks close in on a championship, Irving has embraced the role and he's decided to accept whatever conditions are needed to result in success for the team. If Irving can stay consistent and continue to support Doncic as he has been, I think the Mavs will be a tough team to beat in the Finals and this may only be the first of a long line of successful playoff runs.\n\nRelated: Dereck Lively II Gets Real On Luka Doncic And Kyrie Irving As Leaders: \"Their Voice Is Law\"\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

These two organizations have a chance to win a championship, and there are various storylines that tie into what could become a historic matchup. Perhaps the greatest headline revolves around Kyrie Irving going up against his former team. As many would expect, the city of Boston won't be kind to Kyrie, nor will they embrace him back once this series tips off. But for Irving, this championship series against Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and the Celtics is sort of like a reunion.\n\nIrving has never been the type of person to hold grudges. He especially has no ill feelings towards Tatum or Brown, who were both young players in Boston during Kyrie's two seasons with the team. When questioned about what it feels like going up against his former teammates in the NBA Finals during media day on Wednesday, Irving made it clear that he's proud of everything Tatum and Brown have achieved.\n\n\"I'm excited,\" Irving told reporters at media day. \"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best. They have a great team over there, led by a great coach. So we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough\n\nseries.\n\n\"They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more.\"\n\nIrving, Tatum, and Brown shared the court with one another in Boston during the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons. These three stars were able to advance to the 2018 Eastern Conference Finals with one another, where they lost in seven games to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nDespite all the backlash he has received in his career from Boston, Irving has not let that impact his relationship with either Tatum or Brown. Even though these two stars are Irving's enemies ahead of the NBA Finals, he is still proud of what they have been able to accomplish, given the types of players Tatum and Brown were earlier in their careers when Kyrie was their teammate.\n\nKyrie Irving ready for Boston return in NBA Finals\n\nThe Mavericks roll into the NBA Finals with Irving on a hot streak. He recently had 36 points and five assists in the team's Game 5 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals, marking his third 30-point performance in his last five games.\n\nIrving has won a championship before, and he knows the type of mentality it takes to achieve greatness on the NBA's biggest stage. Fans and the environment are always factors in how games play out, but Kyrie isn't about to let all of the outside noise get in the way of his ultimate goal.\n\n\"You just got to breathe through it. To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions, what they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is,\" Irving explained. \"Don't overthink it. Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball. The fans are going to say what they're going to say.\n\n\"I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game, but it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nThis NBA Finals series in particular is going to be heavily focused on the players and the matchups that will exist. Not only do the Mavericks present Luka Doncic and Irving from their side of things, but the Celtics have been the best team in the league all season.\n\nIn addition to Tatum and Brown, they have other star-quality players like Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, and Kristaps Porzingis. Boston is an experienced, veteran team that has had the NBA Finals circled on their calendars before the season even began. While many did not expect Dallas to be in this spot, Irving has known all along that this is where the Mavericks belonged. Now, it is time for Kyrie to prove to everyone that the Mavs are the best team in the NBA.\n\n\"This is what I've been preparing for since last summer or when our season ended last year. Putting in the time to prepare for moments like this.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_siegel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brett Siegel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jayson-Tatum-Jaylen-Brown-get-eye-opening-Kyrie-Irving-praise-ahead-of-NBA-Finals.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Once Kyrie Irving took the podium, the first question he received was about his former teammate LeBron James.\n\n\"Is that the first question?\" Kyrie Irving chuckled. \"Oh, God, I love it. Got to love this, man.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Celtics' Jrue Holiday Gets Brutally Honest About Guarding Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving\n\nJames gave high praise to Irving on his \"Mind The Game\" podcast, calling him a \"wizard\" and that he's \"so f*****g mad that I am not his running mate anymore.\" He's probably feeling a little disappointed that his Lakers lost in the first round while Irving is about to play in the NBA Finals.\n\nIrving saw the comments and when asked about his thoughts, he responded \" I mean, I have a great reaction. It's appreciated. There's a lot of gratitude there, as well. I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now. Definitely miss him. Playing out there, just making things easier, being able to run up and down the floor, just throw the ball to somebody like that, throw it in the air, as athletic as they come... Shout-out to LeBron for that. Knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us. Yeah, I'm looking forward to the future and getting this series started now.\"\n\nBoth players have come a long way since Irving was traded to the Boston Celtics in 2017. James departed for the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2018 offseason, winning a championship in the 2020 Bubble, and became the NBA's all-time leading scorer, passing the great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Irving, meanwhile, signed with the Brooklyn Nets after two seasons in Boston and wore out his welcome in Brooklyn. After three and a half seasons there, he was traded to Dallas at the 2023 trade deadline, where is now thriving alongside Luka Doncic.\n\nAt the time Irving was traded away from Cleveland, he wanted to prove he could lead a team without being in the shadow of LeBron James.

Lebron James admits he is still \"F**king mad\" at Kyrie Irving ahead of the NBA Finals\n\nDuring a recent podcast with J.J. Reddick, LeBron James said Kyrie Irving is the most gifted player he has ever seen. Leading up to the NBA finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics, Kyrie was asked about those comments coming from his former teammate at the Cleveland Cavaliers. Irving clearly seemed like he would've loved to play alongside LeBron James again and even admitted he misses the Lakers star. Keep in mind that Irving was a potential option to play for the Lakers last year before he ultimately decided to play alongside Luka Doncic at the Dallas Mavericks. Kyrie went on a long response when asked about James' recent praise directed towards him.\n\nIrving said: \"I appreciatd his sentiments. Obviously, I'm in a different age, different place in my life. So is he. I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish,\" Irving said. \"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now. Definitely miss him. Man, when he says comments like that, I think back to us having those moments where we're down in a series, up in a series, we're really demanding greatness from each other. Off the court, our families meshing well. ... I definitely think about those times.\"\n\nFortunately for Kyrie Irving, he is not alone at the Dallas Mavericks. In fact, he is playing this series alongside one of the young talents with the most unreal proyection in the entire league. Luka Doncic arrived at the NBA without realizing the tremendous impact he would have so early in his career. Irving is no longer the young buck he once was when the Cavaliers were dominant in the Eastern Conference. Today, Irving is a much more experienced player who is helping the Mavs tremendously with his still intact ball handling skills. He may not play with LeNron again but he is not doing terribly at the Dallas Mavericks with Luka Doncic by his side.

Recently he had some interesting thoughts on one of his former teammates this week leading up to the NBA Finals. James on this week's \"Mind the Game\" podcast with J.J. Redick, had high praise for his former teammate Kyrie Irving.\n\n\"I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I ended up with absolutely none because he's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen,\" James said. \"He has the best gifts I've ever seen of any NBA player.\"\n\nRedick even chimed in on Irving's game, calling it \"aesthetically pleasing and beautiful.\"\n\nLeBron James Gives High Praise To Former Teammate\n\nLeBron and Kyrie History\n\nJames and Irving played together for three years from 2014-2017 on the Cleveland Cavaliers, making it to three straight NBA Finals and winning just one in 2016. Both players benefited from each other and enjoyed playing with each other. However, Irving forced his way out and was traded to the Boston Celtics. Fast forward seven years and Irving is now on the Dallas Mavericks and helped lead them to the NBA Finals.\n\nWhen Irving left Cleveland there was some bad blood between him and James. Over time that bad blood went away and there were even talks this past offseason about him potentially playing with LeBron again in LA. Since LeBron is no longer teammates with Irving, he has to admire his talents from afar. One attribute in particular that LeBron is fond of is his ability to shoot with his weak hand. James said that if Irving is having an off night with his right hand he will just use his left for the rest of the game.\n\nWhat Makes Irving So Great\n\nA lot of people are probably wondering why Lebron said this about his former teammate. Besides the fact that he can shoot with his weak hand, he is also one of the best ball handlers in the NBA. Some of the moves he can pull off are just eye-dropping of how he can do them. He can shoot from all three levels, and he is also one of the best if not the best finishers ever in the NBA. Pretty much anything you can do offensively he is great at. Irving is also extremely clutch. Notably in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals, he hit one of the biggest shots in league history. There is a reason why LeBron said what he said about Irving and his admiration for his former teammate.\n\nThe Last Word\n\nIf it wasn't because of injuries and the Golden State Warriors creating the ultimate superteam by adding Kevin Durant. There is a real argument to be made that the Cavaliers could have won three straight NBA Finals. Irving may have never left and who knows how many rings they could have gotten together, that is how good this duo was. However, that is in the past as LeBron is going to have to sit and watch his former teammate take on the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals.", "source": {"uri": "lastwordonsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Last Word on Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/USATSI_23134328_168404824_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Since then, he's likened the Boston faithful to a 'scorned girlfriend,' accused the fans of 'subtle racism,' burnt sage at the city's TD Garden to 'cleanse the energy' in the arena, stomped on the Celtics' mid-court logo, and famously flipped off the raucous crowd during last year's playoffs.\n\nNow in his first full season with the Mavs, Irving says he regrets the obscene hand gesture: 'When we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s*** a little bit, that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level.'\n\nBut to Celtics fans, the moment was rewarding: The man who broke his promise to stay in Beantown in 2019 was clearly rattled, and by responding with an obscene hand gesture, he gave Bostonians ample motivation to continue the abuse throughout the upcoming Finals.\n\nKyrie Irving throws his arm around teammate Luka Doncic during Dallas' ongoing playoff run\n\nA Boston Celtics fan mocks Kyrie Irving with a t-shirt during a 2022 game at TD Garden\n\nOf course, things weren't always so rocky for Irving in the Massachusetts capital, where his father, Drederick, once played college ball for Rick Pitino at Boston University.\n\nIrving arrived in a 2017 trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the initial returns were promising.\n\nDespite a season-ending injury to All-Star acquisition Gordon Hayward in the opener, the young Celtics overachieved in 2017-18 by finishing with the East's second-best record.\n\nThey would ultimately fall to LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the conference finals as Irving sat with knee problems, but Irving was nonetheless embraced in Boston. One fan had the All-Star's likeness shaved into the back of his head. Others pleaded for Irving's discarded wrist bands and sneakers after games, while a few had their clothing personally autographed by the former Duke star.\n\nAnd when Irving dismissed talk of his impending free agency at the onset of the 2018-19 season, instead predicting a long-term deal for himself in Boston, Celtics fans were positively overjoyed.\n\n'Obviously, a lot of great players have come before me, but to grow my name in Boston Celtics tradition and history is something I'm glad I can do, and I plan on,' Irving told reporters.\n\n'I do not want to uproot my family and just be dealing with anything new again,' he continued. 'No disrespect to other organizations, but here is perfect for me.'\n\nA Kyrie Irving fan shows off his favorite player's likeness on the back of his head in 2018\n\nKyrie Irving was happy to meet with fans and have his picture taken during his stint in Boston\n\nOne Kyrie Irving fan tried to goad the All-Star into signing an autograph for him in 2018\n\nUnfortunately, things began to unravel for Irving in 2018-19 as the Celtics fell to fourth in the East before losing to the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nWorst of all, Irving was dismal in the fifth and final game, making just 6 of 21 field goals for 15 points, while finishing with a -25 plus-minus rating for the night.\n\nAs it turns out, Irving's tenure in Boston had been worsening for months.\n\nAlthough it wasn't known at the time, he'd been the subject of 2019 trade talks between the Celtics and rival New York Knicks, according to a recent report by Yahoo! Sports. The deal was never completed, but Irving was reportedly offered to New York in exchange for Kristaps Porzingis, the versatile 7-foot-3 center who was ultimately sent to Dallas and now starts for Boston.\n\nWhether Irving knew of the trade talks remains a mystery, but by the summer of 2019 he was reportedly looking to leave the Celtics in an effort to join friends Kevin Durant and DeAndre Jordan in Brooklyn. Soon thereafter, Irving confirmed his defection in early July by signing a four-year, $141million deal with the Nets.\n\nDejected Celtics fans responded by burning Irving jerseys on social media, but Boston's animosity towards the mercurial point guard didn't stop there. In the coming seasons with the Nets, Irving would be booed mercilessly by Celtics fans every time he touched the ball in Boston.\n\nThen, in June of 2021, a Celtics fan was arrested and ordered to stay away from the city's TD Garden after throwing a water bottle at Irving during a playoff game.\n\nThe hectic scene was eerily reminiscent of the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, when Celtics focused their intense hatred New Jersey Nets All-Star Jason Kidd and his family.\n\n'You have to win with class and lose with class, and hopefully somebody will learn that,' Kidd, now the Mavericks head coach, said at the time. 'They have the right to cheer and boo. But there also is a fine line. You don't jeopardize anybody's family and friends in that sense of doing something ridiculous.'\n\nA man who was believed to throw a water bottle towards Irving is escorted out by security\n\nOf course, Kidd never accused Boston of 'subtle racism' as Irving has. Nor did he anger fans by stomping across the Celtics logo during the 2021 postseason.\n\nIrving, on the other hand, seemed to take pride in provoking the TD Garden crowd.\n\n'I know what to expect in here,' Irving said after a 2021 playoff game against Boston. 'And it's the same energy I'm giving back to them.'\n\nIrving and the Nets got the best of the Celtics in 2021, but it was Boston that swept Brooklyn in the first round of the 2022 postseason as Irving was reduced to flipping off the crowd at TD Garden.\n\nIn one instance, Irving celebrated a made 3-pointer by flipping off fans on his way down the court. Later, before an inbounds pass, Irving flashed both middle fingers to the crowd behind his head.\n\nAnd when one Celtics fan yelled 'Kyrie, you suck' as the Nets guard walked to the locker room, Irving snapped back, 'suck my d***, b****,' as seen on a viral TikTok video.\n\nHe later described the incidents as part of a tit-for-tat exchange with fans.\n\n'Look, where I'm from, I'm used to all these antics and people being close nearby,' the New Jersey native said after pouring in a team-high 39 points in the Game 1 loss. 'It's nothing new when I come into this building what it's going to be like -- but it's the same energy they have for me, I'm going to have the same energy for them.\n\n'And it's not every fan, I don't want to attack every fan, every Boston fan,' Irving continued. 'When people start yelling ''p****' or ''b****'' and ''f*** you'' and all this stuff, there's only but so much you take as a competitor. We're the ones expected to be docile and be humble, take a humble approach, f*** that, it's the playoffs. This is what it is.'\n\nIrving is still friendly with his ex-Celtics teammates, including Brown (right) and Tatum (left)\n\nInterestingly, Irving still has a good relationship with former Celtics teammates like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, whom he described as 'very special people' during a friendly exchange with reporters this week.\n\nHe's also rejuvenated his career alongside Mavs star Luka Doncic, who has praised Irving as both a teammate and a leader.\n\nBut for all of the sudden positivity in Irving's life, he is just 1-10 against the Celtics since stomping on the team's logo in May of 2021.\n\nRead More Luka Doncic has his beer confiscated by Mavericks VP as he celebrated reaching the NBA Finals with his dad\n\nAny perceived frustration on Irving's part this series will only serve as encouragement for Celtics fans hoping for a record 18th NBA crown.\n\nAnd if Irving is going to have any chance at winning his second title, he's likely going to have to be the bigger person.\n\n'You just got to breathe through it,' Irving said earlier this week. 'To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions, what they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it.\n\n'Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness,' he continued. 'It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man.'\n\nAbove all, Irving believes it's he - and not the crowd - who will make the difference.\n\n'It's about the players at the end of the day.'", "source": {"uri":

Let's look at Kyrie Irving's 10 greatest teammates.\n\nKyrie Irving is well-respected in the NBA, as he easily has the best handles in the league. Popularly known as Uncle Drew, Irving is an eight-time All-Star, three-time All-NBA Team selection, and an NBA champion.\n\nThese days, Irving is preparing for the NBA Finals with the Mavericks taking care of business in the playoffs. But while Irving has found success individually, he wouldn't have done it without some solid teammates. Let's rank Kyrie Irving's 10 greatest teammates.\n\n10. Ben Simmons\n\nBen Simmons' arrival in Brooklyn was supposed to be a fresh start for the three-time All-Star. Unfortunately, both Simmons and Irving never really played a lot of games together due to injuries. But when they did see action together, the duo showed some promise by posting an 18-12 record. However, Simmons is still one of the stars that was able to play alongside Irving.\n\n9. Gordon Hayward\n\nSpeaking of injuries, right from the get-go, Hayward's first game with Irving ended in catastrophe with the All-Star forward fracturing his ankle off an alley-oop play. Since then, Hayward was never the same. Although we saw flashes of what this duo could accomplish together, the Celtics could never make it to the Finals with Irving and Hayward.\n\n8. James Harden\n\nPrior to Ben Simmons joining the Nets, Brooklyn engaged in a blockbuster trade to first acquire former NBA MVP James Harden. With Harden's acquisition, the 10-time All-Star became Irving's third teammate who has previously won the MVP award.\n\nWhile Harden's acquisition was welcomed at first, the former MVP's struggles in the postseason wasn't helpful at all. Furthermore, their chemistry wasn't quite polished thanks to the lack of games played together with only 41.\n\n7. Al Horford\n\nWhile Irving was with the Celtics, a fellow veteran that helped him lead the team was All-Star big man Al Horford. Horford's skillset as a modern-day center ultimately elevated the Celtics into a formidable contender in the Eastern Conference. His ability to play inside and out made life a little easier for Irving during his stint in Boston.\n\n6. Jaylen Brown\n\nBack when Irving played for the Celtics, Jaylen Brown was still a rising star trying to find his footing in the NBA. Today, he's one of the Celtics' biggest stars.\n\nAlthough the Brown and Irving team-up wasn't as productive back in the day, Brown has improved by leaps and bounds today. A lot of that credit should also go to Irving for mentoring the promising Celtics core back in the day.\n\n5. Jayson Tatum\n\nAside from Jaylen Brown, the Celtics also invested in a young talented Jayson Tatum when they acquired Kyrie Irving from the Cavaliers. Like Brown, Tatum was still a young star back in the day.\n\nFast-forward to today, he has emerged as the Celtics' face of the franchise. While we never got to witness how a prime Tatum will work with Irving, it's safe to say that the Celtics are in good hands under Tatum's leadership.\n\n4. Kevin Love\n\nMany basketball fans will agree that the Cleveland Cavaliers wouldn't have won the NBA championship without their third star, Kevin Love. Like Horford was for the Celtics, Love had a polished inside and outside game that made life easier for Irving. Moreover, Love's respectable defense and elite rebounding was a huge lift for Irving's conquest of his first NBA title.\n\n3. Kevin Durant\n\nWhen Kevin Durant left the Warriors to team up with Irving in Brooklyn, the news immediately shocked the NBA world. The sky was the limit for the elite scoring duo.\n\nWhen healthy together, the duo would lead Brooklyn to 54 wins out of 88 games played together. However, off-court issues concerning Irving's vaccine stance, promotion of antisemitic content, and injuries never allowed this duo to showcase their full potential.\n\n2. Luka Doncic\n\nThere's no doubt that the Mavericks are in the NBA Finals thanks to the combustible duo of Irving and Luka Doncic. Although many critics have mentioned about the fit of Irving alongside Doncic, the duo has proved everyone wrong after their great playoff campaign thus far.\n\nThey eliminated the Los Angeles Clippers before taking care of business against the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder. They then earned a trip to the NBA Finals after a dominant series against the Timberwolves. Thanks to Doncic, a second NBA championship could be incoming for Irving.\n\n1. LeBron James\n\nThus far, there has been only one teammate quite like no other for Irving and that was LeBron James. Since James' return to Cleveland, Irving and The King formed an unstoppable duo as they led the Cavs to three-consecutive NBA Finals trips together while dominating the Eastern Conference.\n\nBut more importantly, it was this very duo that helped the Cavs win the franchise's first NBA championship at the expense of a 73-9 Warriors despite being down 3-1 in the 2016 NBA Finals.", "source": {"uri":

While Irving stated that he keeps these things very fluid, he would not mind following in the footsteps of Nico Harrison, Jason Kidd, and potentially Luka Doncic this summer and signing a contract extension with the Mavericks.\n\n\"The future is still being written. But I can tell you that with all the extensions that are going around with J Kidd and Nico and potentially this summer with Luka, I think I don't mind being complimentary if we're going to continue to put this band together. We have some great pieces around us.\"\n\nIrving then spoke about the self-doubt he has faced on a regular basis during his NBA career, and how that affects his decisions. While Kyrie assesses things every season and focuses on basketball, he did state that he is very happy with his stint with the Mavericks.\n\n\"There's always those thoughts that will creep in - 'I'm just a what-if, what could happen?'. You never know, right? It's season to season. So, I just like to let it play out and stay in the present moment but I am enjoying my time here.\"\n\nIrving was traded to the Mavericks in 2023 after a tense situation with the Nets came to a head. While the Mavericks missed the playoffs that year, Irving seemingly bought into the vision of the franchise, re-signing with them for a two-year deal. This decision has paid dividends for both parties, as the Mavericks made the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011 with Kyrie on the team.\n\nAre Kyrie Irving And Luka Doncic The NBA's Next Dynastic Duo?\n\nDespite a shaky start playing together, Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have gelled really well together, and have formed an incredibly dangerous back-court. Luka and Kyrie led the Mavericks during the playoffs and defeated some of the best teams in the NBA like the Clippers, the Thunder, and the Timberwolves to reach the NBA Finals.\n\nIrving has reminded many fans why he was considered one of the best players in the league with his performance this season. During the regular season, Irving averaged a strong 25.6 points, 5.2 assists, and 5.0 rebounds per game. And while his numbers dipped slightly in the playoffs, it was not a reflection of the quality of his play.\n\nDuring the playoffs, Irving has averaged 22.8 points, 5.2 assists, and 3.9 rebounds. His low scoring is mostly due to him not being the first option, and Luka Doncic having some very high-scoring games in the playoffs. Irving averaged 27.0 points, 4.6 assists, and 3.6 rebounds in the Western Conference Finals against the Timberwolves, taking his scoring up a level on the big stage.\n\nIrving will be playing against his former team, the Celtics in the 2024 NBA Finals. While the two sides had a bad falling out when Irving left the team in 2019, he still showed respect to the organization, claiming that he would not be where he is as a player today without his stint in Boston.\n\nIt will be a difficult series for Irving and the Mavericks, as the Celtics have long been considered the favorites to win the NBA championship. But the Mavericks have been defiant in the playoffs, and can never be counted out.\n\nRelated: Kyrie Irving Responds To LeBron James Reminiscing About Their Run Together: \"Appreciate How Much We've Been Able To Accomplish.\"\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Mavericks General Manager Nico Harrison used to work for Nike, and Coach Jason Kidd was the point guard of the then-New Jersey Nets when Irving was growing up in that area.\n\nIrving caught up with the team in Los Angeles after the trade, and the Mavericks won their first two games with him.\n\n\"You could see the smile,\" Kidd said. \"You could see the relief, or you could see that he was ready to have fun and play the game that he loves.\"\n\nThe partial season together didn't work out for Irving and Doncic. Dallas missed the playoffs. The first full season together was what the Mavericks expected when they pulled off Harrison's first blockbuster trade.\n\nA late-season surge lifted the Mavs to fifth in the West, although they've been the lower seed throughout these playoffs.\n\nDallas beat the Los Angeles Clippers in six games in the first round, ousting Tyronn Lue, Irving's coach from his championship season alongside LeBron James in Cleveland in 2016.\n\n\"He's very, very patient,\" Lue said after that series of the difference between the Irving he coached and today's version. \"You couldn't get this Kyrie when I had him. He wants to kill you every moment, every second. But now you can see, he's just letting the game come to him.\"\n\nThe Mavericks beat top-seeded Oklahoma City in six games before knocking out No. 3 Minnesota in five games in the Western Conference finals, the clincher giving Dallas a five-game road winning streak in the playoffs.\n\nIrving and Doncic have at least another season together. Irving has a player option for 2025-26, Doncic for the season after that.\n\nKidd believes a preseason trip to Madrid, where Doncic grew as a teenaged pro in the EuroLeague, helped the two superstars bond.\n\nNow, winning is cementing that bond, one of the most poignant moments for the pair coming in the final seconds of Game 3 against the Timberwolves, after the Mavericks knew they had clinched a 3-0 lead.\n\n\"When we were winning by nine on that last possession, I told (Irving), 'I'm tired,' and he told me, 'That's the way it's supposed to be,' \" Doncic said. \"He brought the calmness to the team and to me. He brought the maturity. I'm learning from him every day.\"\n\nThere might not have been many teammates lining up to say those things in Irving's first three stops, and the magnitude looms larger with the words coming from the face of the Dallas franchise.\n\nEven though his relationships with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and some of his other former Boston teammates are fine, Irving believes he is a better teammate now than he was then.\n\n\"The greatest thing I learned from Boston was just being able to manage not only my emotions, but just what's going on on a day-to-day basis of being a leader of a team or being one of the leaders and having young guys around you that have their own goals,\" Irving said. \"You have to learn how to put the big picture first.\"\n\nA more introspective Irving is on the big stage again, and knows what's coming from the crowd in Boston.\n\nDallas Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving answers questions during a news conference after the Mavericks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 5 of the NBA basketball Western Conference finals, Thursday, May 30, 2024, in Minneapolis.

[He] Knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us,\" Irving said on June 5 during the pre-NBA Finals presser.\n\nIrving was amused that the first question was neither about his current team nor his former team Boston Celtics, their opponents in the NBA Finals that begins on Thursday, June 6, in Boston.\n\n\"Is that the first question?\" Irving replied when Joe Vardon of The Athletic asked if he saw James' podcast comments complimenting him and missing playing with him. \"Oh, God, I love it! Got to love this, man!\"\n\nJames' comments, however, came within the NBA Finals preview in his \"Mind the Game\" podcast with ESPN analyst and Lakers' top coaching candidate JJ Redick.\n\n\"I will call Kyrie the wizard all the time,\" James said when Redick asked him about Irving. \"There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do. I'm playing like so happy and so proud and to watch him and continue his growth and whatever the case and at the same time I'm so [expletive] mad at the same time that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nJames and Irving wanted to team up anew at Los Angeles but it was nixed when the Brooklyn Nets rejected the Lakers' offer centered on Russell Westbrook and two future first-round picks in 2027 and 2029 last season, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin. The Nets, instead, shipped Irving to Dallas for Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a 2029 first-round pick and second-round picks in 2027 and 2029.\n\nIrving pinned the blame on the aborted reunion on their respective team's decision-makers.\n\n\"Everything was considered,\" Irving told Mellisa Rohlin of Fox Sports on May 3. \"He's a great friend of mine, a great brother of mine. We obviously played together [in Cleveland]. Everybody knows our history. But there were so many different factors in between. When it comes to business decisions, you have to ask the GMs, the presidents why certain things didn't work out.\"\n\nJames was vocal that he missed Irving. The feeling is mutual.\n\n\"Definitely miss him,\" Irving said of the Lakers forward during the pre-NBA Finals presser on June 5. \"Playing out there, just making things easier, being able to run up and down the floor, just throw the ball to somebody like that, throw it in the air, as athletic as they come.\n\nYeah, just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life.\"\n\nIrving appreciated James' compliment.\n\n\"I mean, I have a great reaction,\" Irving told reporters on June 5. \"It's appreciated. There's a lot of gratitude there, as well.\"\n\nThe Mavericks star also waxed nostalgic as he reminisced about his partnership with James in Cleveland that ended the city's NBA championship drought with the first 3-1 comeback in the NBA Finals history in 2016.\n\n\"Man, when he says comments like that, I think back to us having those moments where we're down in a series, up in a series, we're really demanding greatness from each other,\" Irving said. \"Off the court, our families meshing well.\n\nI definitely think about those times. Now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect but also now I'm at this stage, able to use some of the formulas that I was taught from him, some of the great teachers that have come before me. I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game.\"\n\nNow 32, Irving has a far different perspective than what he had when he demanded a trade out of Cleveland to step out of James' shadow.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm in a different age, a different place in my life,\" Irving said. \"So is he. I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish.\n\nI think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@heavy.com", "name": "Alder Almo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Dinwiddie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Dinwiddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_Finney-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dorian Finney-Smith"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1247517062-e1717636897795.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 349, "textEnd": 355, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 564, "textEnd": 570}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1886, "textEnd": 1891}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Winning it all means squaring off with a familiar foe.\n\nKyrie Irving is in his second season with the Dallas Mavericks, and one of the club's top offensive weapon. He will be critical to Dallas' scoring attack, but much of the commentary leading up to the series has been how Irving will contend not with Boston's defenders but with the fans in the rafters. Irving spent two seasons with the Celtics before joining the Brooklyn Nets in free agency, and his relationship with Boston has been tumultuous ever since. With the series set to tip Thursday at TD Garden, Irving was asked about how he feels about the city and his old teammates.\n\nIrving acknowledged how much history he has with the city of Boston, but that he is ready to focus on basketball.\n\n\"I've experienced Boston twofold,\" Irving explained. \"My first few years being in the NBA playing for the Cavs, then coming here to Boston, then being right down the street in Brooklyn, now being here in the Finals playing against them in a potential four-to-seven-game series. You just got to breathe through it.\"\n\nIrving made it clear that previous exchanges with Celtics fans were indeed emotional in both directions. The 32-year-old outlined how it is best to channel those feelings into something more constructive.\n\n\"To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions,\" Irving said. \"What they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it.\n\n\"I've been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety,\" Irving said. \"Some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball. The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nPlaying in Boston isn't just about reuniting with fans in the stand for Irving. He was asked about squaring off with his former teammates Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Al Horford.\n\n\"I'm excited,\" Irving said. \"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level, playing against the best of the best.\n\nIrving continued sharing his excitement about the upcoming series and the respect he has for his opponent.\n\n\"They have a great team over there led by a great coach,\" Irving said. \"So we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough series. They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more.\"\n\n\"This is what I've been preparing for since last summer, or when our season ended last year,\" Irving continued. \"Putting in the time to prepare for moments like this.\"\n\nGame 1 of the NBA Finals is in Boston, and at the time of this writing, the Celtics are favored to win the series. No doubt Irving will do everything he can to avoid that outcome.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nWho does Jayson Tatum need to be for the Boston Celtics in the 2024 NBA Finals?

Game 1 is Thursday, June 6, and Game 2 is Sunday, June 9, in Boston. Irving previously played for the Celtics for two seasons (2017-18 and 2018-19).\n\nThe 32-year-old dynamic point guard helped the Mavericks to a 4-1 series win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals. He and fellow superstar Luca Doncic each scored 36 points in the clinching 124-103 win on Thursday, May 30.

He led the Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA title with megastar LeBron James in 2016, when the team defeated the Golden State Warriors.

After spending more than a year in Minnesota, Irving regards his tenure with the Mavericks as the most rewarding phase of his career.\n\nIn a candid interview with Vincent Goodwill from Yahoo, Irving shared his reflections on his time with the Mavericks.\n\n\"This has been the greatest portion of my career. To be able to now give wisdom and also speak from a place of experience. When you're a young person, again, you're trying to speed through life, you're trying to get through everything,\" Irving said.\n\nSince joining the Mavericks, Irving seems to have found a renewed passion for basketball. This season, he has averaged an impressive 25.6 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game in the regular season.\n\nIrving's leadership and on-court performance have been pivotal for the Mavericks, especially in the postseason. One of his standout performances came in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals, where the follower of Kobe Bryant scored 36 points. This crucial game helped propel the Mavericks to the NBA Finals after 13 years.\n\nKyrie Irving is set to enter his fourth NBA final. After reaching his first NBA final with the Mavericks, Irving took a moment to praise the team's head coach, Jason Kidd.\n\nThe 2011 No. 1 overall pick recently expressed his gratitude to Kidd for stretching his helping shoulder for Irving.\n\n\"Coming to Dallas, just being around J Kidd, somebody who also can relate to me about being imperfect and, and having mistakes in their life and being able to redeem themselves and persevere. Still answer to the naysayers,\" Irving said.\n\nThe Mavericks' fans and the entire organization are now eagerly watching Irving, hoping he can replicate his remarkable performance from the 2016 NBA Finals.

Got to love this, man.\"\n\nMore questions about other former teammates of Irving's on the Boston Celtics followed, of course. Boston was the point guard's landing spot after he was traded away from James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in summer 2017.\n\nBut the first order of business was James, whom he teamed up with for three seasons from 2014 to 2017 and made three straight trips to the Finals, winning it all together in 2016 in a memorable seven-game series against a record-setting Golden State Warriors team that went 73-9 in the regular season.\n\nIrving said he \"appreciated\" James' sentiments on his \"Mind the Game\" podcast with JJ Redick, when James lauded the former No. 1 pick as \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nAnd seven years after playing together, Irving, 32, said his relationship with the 39-year-old James has only flourished.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm in a different age, different place in my life. So is he. I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish,\" Irving said. \"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now.\"\n\nIrving, who was traded to Dallas from the Brooklyn Nets last season after James' Los Angeles Lakers made a run at acquiring him, reciprocated the wistfulness.\n\n\"Definitely miss him,\" Irving said. \"Man, when he says comments like that, I think back to us having those moments where we're down in a series, up in a series, we're really demanding greatness from each other. Off the court, our families meshing well. ... I definitely think about those times.\"\n\nJames and Irving's Cavs became the first team in to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the Finals in 2016. Game 5 of that series, the first of their three straight wins to close it out, was also historic as James and Irving became the first teammates ever to both score 40-plus points in the same Finals game.\n\nAll of the success they shared, however, left the then-25-year-old Irving feeling incomplete. Sources told ESPN that during Irving's last postseason run with the Cavs in 2017, he went consecutive days in between playoff series reporting to the team's practice facility without speaking to any teammates.\n\nIt was something Irving indirectly acknowledged when asked about the ups and downs he has experienced since requesting a trade out of Cleveland to finally finding a comfort zone all these years later with the Mavs.\n\n\"Basketball has been a great teacher for me, but life has been an even better one,\" Irving said. \"Using those same principles I've learned in life apply to basketball has allowed me to connect to my teammates better. There's no silent treatment that's coming randomly throughout the year because I don't know how to emotionalize or vocalize how I'm feeling. Some of the things I struggled with as a young player, I've now been able to accept this is what comes with being in this position. Taking on the pressure. Then also teaching my teammates how to get through it.\"\n\nIt's the same role that James took on with him.\n\n\"Now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect, but also now I'm at this stage, able to use some of the formulas that I was taught from [James], some of the great teachers that have come before me,\" Irving said. \"I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game.\"\n\nAnd Irving had one more compliment for the league's all-time leading scorer.\n\n\"Shoutout to LeBron for that,\" Irving said. \"Knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_mcmenamin@espn.com.sg", "name": "Dave McMenamin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F1209%2Fr1264324_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

They've been championship teammates, there's been reported rifts, and now, there's nothing but love, as James and JJ Redick gushed about Irving on the latest Mind the Game Pod.\n\nLeBron lamented about having to watch Irving from the sidelines instead of being on the court with him, and as reported by Ramona Shelburne of ESPN, they were almost teammates again on the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nWhen asked about Irving, LeBron couldn't stop complimenting Irving. \"I will call Kyrie the wizard all the time. There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do. I'm playing like so happy and so proud and to watch him and continue his growth and whatever the case and at the same time I'm so fucking mad at the same time that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nWhile reminiscing about the absurd ability of Irving, LeBron almost couldn't find the words to describe it, saying, \"I just remember those times. The most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nA former NBA Rookie of the Year, Irving's career averages of 23.6 points, 5.7 assists and 1.3 steals are quite impressive. The 50/40/90 club is meant to separate the best shooters in the league and historically, it's held a lot of weight. After putting together a shooting line of .497/.411/.905 in 2023-24, Irving's career averages rose to .474/.393/.886.\n\nIrving doesn't always get the praise he deserves, as shockingly his trophy case is awfully barren. His allure and his highlight package stand up against anyone who has ever played, yet Irving has never received any MVP consideration and has made just three All-NBA teams. What other players say about Irving, however, speaks volumes.\n\nJJ Redick chimed in with, \"I'm not sure there's ever been a player that's more aesthetically pleasing.\"\n\nFair or not, Irving became a source of contention amongst basketball fans during the COVID-19 pandemic. His unwillingness to get vaccinated was a big story, reportedly costing him the ability to sign a 4-year, $100 million extension with the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nA frustrated Irving said, \"I didn't appreciate how me being vaccinated, all of a sudden, came to be a stigma within my career that I don't want to play, or I'm willing to give up everything to be a voice for the voiceless.\"\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals and essentially this entire run have proven to be a valuable opportunity to turn the focus back to Irving's basketball ability and away from his polarizing statements on things like the shape of the Earth.\n\nHaving already won an NBA Championship alongside LeBron for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Irving can join an elite list of players to win championships for multiple franchises. The Dallas Mavericks are underdogs to the Boston Celtics, but the AP is reporting that the public is pushing the line the other way at BetMGM Sportsbook, with 80% of the bets coming in being put on the Mavericks to win the title.\n\nUnfortunately, LeBron will have to continue to watch from the outside, wondering what could have been.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_dunlap@heavy.com", "name": "Michael Dunlap", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramona_Shelburne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ramona Shelburne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-694324092-e1716328563828.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Smith.\n\nIrving's athleticism was particularly evident in the Western Conference Finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Throughout the series, he accumulated an impressive 135 points, 18 rebounds, and 23 assists. His stellar performance was crucial in propelling the Mavericks into the NBA Finals after 13 years.\n\nLeBron James and Kyrie Irving played three seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2014 to 2017, creating a dynamic partnership that captivated fans.

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nKyrie Irving is not going to receive a warm welcome when the NBA Finals tip off in Boston on Thursday night, but the Dallas Mavericks star continues to insist he is prepared for whatever comes his way.\n\nIt is no secret that Irving will be the most hated man at TD Garden during Game 1 of the NBA Finals and beyond. The star point guard spent two seasons with the Celtics from 2017 to 2019, and things did not go well. Irving openly said he planned to re-sign with Boston before leaving to join Kevin Durant on the Brooklyn Nets. The relationship between Irving and Celtics fans has since been tenuous, to say the least.\n\nMany have wondered how or if Irving will be impacted by the hostile environment, but he said he already has a plan in place to deal with it.\n\n\"You just gotta breathe through it,\" Irving said. \"To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions and what they're saying to you, you have to breathe and realize that this is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it. I've been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety and some of that is nervousness, and it can all be turned into a strength.\"\n\nIrving said earlier this week that he regrets his past interactions with Celtics fans, which have included him making multiple obscene gestures toward the TD Garden crowd. Irving also disrespected his former's team's midcourt logo, which may have been one of the reasons he had a water bottle thrown at him.\n\nIrving faced the Celtics twice in the playoffs when he was with the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets beat Boston in five games in the 2021 first round and were swept in the first round by the Celtics the following year. The stakes are even higher this time, and it sounds like Irving is going to do everything he can to block out the noise.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_delvecchio@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Steve DelVecchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Breathwork", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Breathwork", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kyrie-Irving-Mavs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

[I'm] so proud to watch him continue his growth and whatever the case may be, and ... mad at the same time that I am not his running mate anymore,\" James said.\n\nThe four-time league MVP also called Irving the \"ultimate wildcard\" as he described his own realization during the Western Conference finals that the pairing of Irving alongside Luka Doncic would be capable of claiming its own NBA championship trophy.\n\n\"I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with absolutely none. Because it's just, he's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen. He has the best gifts I've ever seen of any NBA player,\" James said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've never seen a guy in my NBA life that feels better at times shooting with his off hand than he does with his with his primary. If Kyrie is off in a game with his right hand, he will literally go exclusively to his left hand. I've never seen nothing like that. The shot, one thing I'm thinking, the shot that he made versus Denver, towards the end of the regular season on Joker [Nikola Joki\u0107] is one of the most ridiculous shots I've ever seen in my life. He's just that special.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 17 games this postseason, Irving is averaging 22.8 points, 5.2 assists and and 3.9 rebounds a game. He is shooting 48.5% from the floor (42.1% from three-point range) while playing 40.2 minutes a night.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's ever been a player that's more aesthetically pleasing when he has it going,\" said Reddick. \"His game is beautiful, you know what I'm saying? He always talks about how basketball players are artists. He's an artist on the court. And I got to be honest, like, it's not invalid. Sometimes like, yeah, this guy's an artist. You called him a wizard, I'll call him an artist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames: \"We're both saying the exact same thing. And he's just, he's remarkable.\"\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreLuka Doncic responds to Chandler Parsons saying he had 'beef' with Kristaps PorzingisMavericks' Kyrie Irving signs father to his ANTA shoe line\n\nFind more Mavericks coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/5ZXQPWPMYRGNNFOP56T3WLHSYY.jpg?auth=6d81cbfc8298d179534edd2f75142c7a9c94b1836398e46aec548c09fbb75549&height=467&width=830&focal=2299,4&quality=40", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

However, after Irving forced his way out of Cleveland to lead his own team, \"The King\" is missing his old running mate. Irving has found his way to the Dallas Mavericks, where he and Luka Doncic made the 2024 NBA Finals. The pair will take on the Boston Celtics as game one is set for June 6th.\n\nAs said by The Sun, James recently appeared on J.J. Redick's podcast, Mind The Game, where he expressed his feelings about the Kyrie situation. The \"Kid from Akron\" had nothing but high praise for his old teammate and friend.\n\n\"There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do,\" he explained. And sitting here watching [The Playoffs], I'm playing like so f*****g happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth and whatever the case may be. And at the same time, I'm so f*****g mad at the same time that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nEven though things ended on bad terms in Cleveland, these two NBA legends are still friends, and there have even been talks about a reunion. LeBron James continued by saying that Kyrie Irving is the \"ultimate wild card.\" Having him on your team is like playing a draw-four card every time in Uno.\n\nHowever, this feeling of respect and regret goes both ways. Irving has stated that he made a mistake by requesting a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers. Kyrie knows that if he had just talked to Bron, they would have worked it out.\n\nLeBron James and Kyrie Irving made history together many times. The 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers are still the only team to ever come back from being down three games to one in the NBA Finals.

Obviously, I am at a different age, different place in my life. So is he. I think we have both been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish. I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was younger.\"\n\nKyrie and LeBron in Cleveland fell apart\n\nIrving was supposed to be the Cleveland Cavaliers' next franchise player when they picked him first overall in the 2011 NBA Draft. But when Akron's prodigal son decided to return to Ohio, he was pushed back into a Robin role with the Cavs. The two helped the Cavs end a 52-year title drought. Still, after winning their first ring together, they fell apart, with Irving wanting a bigger role.\n\nKyrie left for Boston and then Brooklyn but did not find success there. He was traded to the Mavs last season and has since found a home there. Irving believes the events that led him to Dallas have prepared him for the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\n\"I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game,\" Irving added. \"Shout-out to LeBron for that. He knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us.\"\n\nLeBron knows how to get attention\n\nKing James is one of the best players to ever play the game. But he is also one of the best at getting people's attention. Following their loss to the Denver Nuggets in the 2023 Western Conference Finals, LeBron hinted at retirement, which shifted the attention from his team getting swept in the WCF.\n\n\"We'll see what happens going forward,\" James said last year.\"I don't know. I don't know. I've got a lot to think about, to be honest. I've got a lot to think about, to be honest. Just for me personally, going forward with the game of basketball, I've got a lot to think about.\"\n\nBut maybe LeBron wasn't trying to get media attention when he talked about missing Irving. It's no secret that he wanted to pair up with Kyrie last year and was disappointed when Irving ended up in Dallas. Perhaps he just truly misses his buddy.

Irving is the first pro athlete to ever sign their father to a signature deal. Drederick played college basketball at Boston University before playing professionally in Australia, where Kyrie was born.

Ultimately, this will be a series with several narratives. One narrative involves Irving attempting to win his second Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Also, another involves Irving facing the Celtics, the team he spent 2019 with.\n\nIrving started the postseason strong. Then, there were a few blips on the radar. But Irving has had a great postseason in general. Now, he is looking to keep it up. Irving won his only Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in 2016 with LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nHere are the NBA Finals odds, courtesy of FanDuel.\n\nNBA Finals Odds: Kyrie Irving Points Per Game Odds\n\nLook at some of the amazing games Irving has had in these playoffs. First, he started hot, with 31 points in Game 1 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals. Irving also exploded for 40 points in Game 4 of that same series. Next, he helped the Mavs close out the Clippers in Game 6 with 30 points.\n\nThe series against the Oklahoma City Thunder did not go as smoothly. Yet, he did enough to help power the Mavericks to the Western Conference Finals for a showdown with the Minnesota Timberwolves. That is where Irving turned it up a notch. Amazingly, he really came alive at times during the Conference Finals and made some great things happen.\n\nIrving started the series hot with 30 points in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals. Later, he had 33 points in Game 3 to help put the Wolves on the edge of elimination. After he struggled in Game 4, he knew he had to step it up even more. Irving tacked on 36 points in Game 5 to help seal Minnesota's fate and give the Mavericks their ticket to their first NBA Finals appearance since they won their championship in 2011.\n\nIrving averaged 26.5 points per game against the Clippers in the first round. Then, he averaged only 15.6 points per game against the Thunder. But he bounced back properly against the Wolves, averaging 27 points per game.\n\nIrving has shown that he is capable of completely taking over a game. Amazingly, the Mavs are 5-1 in the postseason when he scores at least 40 points. The Mavericks are also 3-1 when he scores under 20 points. Overall, this is a very successful team. But they are almost guaranteed to win when he scores 30 points.\n\nThe Celtics likely will have several choices on who guards Irving. Significantly, Jrue Holiday, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Derrick White can all take turns guarding him. Irving will do everything in his power to help the Mavs and score as many points as possible to get his team the victory.\n\nIrving will hit the over because he has demonstrated an ability to show up in high-pressure situations. Then, he will maneuver his way past this difficult Boston defense.\n\nWhy Kyrie Irving Will Hit the Under\n\nBut this defense is challenging to overcome. Substantially, they can shut down a big-time player. When they played the Cavaliers, they allowed Donovan Mitchell to thrive. But the Celtics shut everyone else down. Consider the fact that Luka Doncic may go off. Yet, Boston might focus more on shutting Irving down if they believe he is the bigger threat.\n\nIrving had some bad games during the playoffs. Significantly, his first bad game came in Game 5 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals. But the Mavs were able to win even when he struggled. Then, he managed just nine points against the Thunder in Game 2 of the Western Conference Semifinals. Irving had another bad game when he managed just nine points in Game 4, which was a game where the Mavs blew a large lead and could not claim the victory. Consequently, it happened again in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, and it was a major reason why the Mavs could not sweep the Wolves.\n\nIrving will hit the under because he is simply too inconsistent to score buckets. Moreover, the Mavericks have several options to fill the hole behind Doncic.\n\nFinal Kyrie Irving Points Per Game Prediction\n\nIrving is the second-best player on this team. Yet, he has also shown in the past that he could take over a game. Consider the fact that Irving has hit 30 points on six different occasions in the NBA Playoffs. Likewise, he has hit 35 or more points on two separate occasions. Irving may have a bad game every now and then. Regardless, he has averaged more than 23 points in two of the three series he has played. Irving is feeling more motivation than ever before. Thus, expect him to hit the over in this series, with 25 points being the likely finish.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kyrie-Irving-NBA-Finals-points-per-game-prediction-odds.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Anthony Davis, Kevin Love were all All-Stars and All-NBA caliber players, but perhaps no player fit more perfectly next to LeBron than Kyrie Irving.\n\nThe talented point guard was a perfect match with LeBron in Cleveland and the two brought the Cavaliers their lone NBA Championship back in 2016. With Irving now headed back to NBA Finals for the first time since 2017 as a member of the Dallas Mavericks, his talent has been back on full display for the basketball world and James has enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nThe Lakers superstar recently heaped an immense amount of praise on his former teammate in the latest episode of his Mind The Game podcast with JJ Redick. LeBron admitted to being mad at no longer being Irving's teammate while adding that he feels the point guard is the most gifted player he has ever seen:\n\n\"Listen, I would call Kyrie 'the wizard' all the time. There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do and sitting here watching it I'm like so f -- ing happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth or whatever the case may be. And at the same time, I'm so f -- ing mad at the same time that I'm not his running mate anymore. I just remember those times. To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card, that's like having a 'Draw 4' in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno, like every single time. Because he has the ability to, like you said, I saw him in Game 1, Western Conference Finals Game 1. I think up until that point, I don't know the stat because I'm not writing down the stats and I don't call the games like you guys. But I think Kyrie was only averaging like eight points in the first half, like in the second round of the playoffs. He was getting his 16 to 20 in the second half, but in the first half of games, he was only getting like dix to eight points. You know you're gonna have Kyrie in the fourth, but I need you sometimes in the first half too. But what he did in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, that was like 'Oh s -- , Dallas may be able to not only win the Western Conference Finals, they might be able to win the whole thing because of that wild card. I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with absolutely none. He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen. He has the best gifts I've ever seen of any NBA player. I've never seen a guy in my NBA life that feels better at times shooting with his off-hand than he does with his primary hand. If Kyrie's off in a game with his right hand, he will literally go exclusively to his left hand. I've never seen nothing like that. The shot that he made versus Denver towards the end of the regular season on Joker? It's one of the most ridiculous shots I've ever seen in my life. He's just that special.\"\n\nEven when Irving was going through controversies and injuries, there has never been any doubt about his talent on the basketball court. It is why many teams, including the Lakers, were open to trading for him when he was available as he is extremely gifted like LeBron says.\n\nMost consider Irving to have the best handles the league has ever seen, and his below the rim finishing, with both hands as James pointed out, is also second to none. Irving is reminding the world just how good he is during this playoff run, but that is something LeBron never forgot.\n\nKyrie Irving, Luka Doncic and the Mavericks will be taking on the Boston Celtics, who have their own outstanding duo in Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, in the NBA Finals. It was the latter who took home Eastern Conference Finals MVP and even though Boston is the hated rival of the Lakers, LeBron James still took some time to praise Brown on social media.\n\nLeBron took to X, calling Brown a 'Young King' and telling him to keep going on his journey as the Celtics star looks to garner more respect following missing out on an All-NBA selection that many felt he deserved.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_hansford@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Corey Hansford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bosh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Love", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kyrie-Irving-LeBron-James.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports / Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NBA Finals are two days away, and once again, the Los Angeles Lakers will be watching from their couches. It's the fourth consecutive year that the Lakers have failed to make the NBA Finals, an unacceptable drought by the Purple and Gold's lofty standards.\n\nAdding to the Lakers' woes, the Boston Celtics are in the running for the title. However, standing in their way are the Western Conference Champions, the Dallas Mavericks. As the fifth seed, the Mavs are the underdogs, but they are not to be underestimated, especially with superstars Luka Donic and Kyrie Irving leading the charge, the latter being a former teammate of Lakers superstar Lebron James.\n\nWith the odds stacked against them, the Mavericks are looking to defy expectations and bring another title to Dallas. The two-headed monster of Doncic and Irving is living up to their potential, and no one is surprised by this, even James. If anyone has firsthand knowledge of these two great players, it's James, especially regarding Irving, who was his teammate for three seasons as members of the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nJames has always held Irving in high regard, and in the latest episode of his Mind The Game podcast with potential future Lakers head coach JJ Redick, he once again expressed his admiration for Irving. James went on to say he cherishes Irving's talents and expressed his regret at no longer being his teammate.\n\n\"[I'm] so f---ing happy... and to watch him continue his growth... and at the same time, I'm so f---ing mad that I am not his running mate anymore... He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nIt's no secret James feels this way toward his former teammate. In his six-year stint as a Laker, James has tried numerous times to get the Lakers brass to push for a trade for Irving. They failed every time, and it's clear James is upset by it.\n\nJames and Irving were teammates for three seasons in Cleveland from 2014-17. They went to three consecutive finals and won one in 2016, famously coming back down from 3-1 against the 73-9 Golden State Warriors. This duo is among the best in this generation and among the best in NBA history. These two fit like no other, and aside from this season, Irving has never been more successful than with James. Although the two were successful together, Irving requested a trade out of Cleveland following the 2017 season and headed to Boston.\n\nIrving and James have overcome some hurdles and achieved some successes without each other. Nonetheless, what they accomplished together is second to none.\n\nAs James' career winds down, they will unlikely play together again. However, it's apparent the respect factor between the two, especially James, will never go away.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2626,h_1477,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_lakers/01hzj3fxs1910chcmwkp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

His basketball career is winding down so now that he has more time off in the spring, he's casting about for new roles.\n\nOne of them is retrospectivist. A good way to assert your dominance over an era is to presume to pronounce on it. Who was who and what was what. James is there now.\n\nDuring an interview on the podcast Mind the Game, James gave his verdict on former teammate and current Dallas Mavericks star Kyrie Irving: \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nThat sounds like a compliment, and it is, sort of.\n\nThere is no world in which James thinks Irving is either better or more gifted than he is (and he's right). With that in mind, it's hard not to read this as James suggesting Irving has thrived despite himself. It's the gifts that win, not the man.\n\nWhatever it is, no player in any modern game has better proved the redemptive power of sport. Whether you are a supporter of that redemption is a different conversation.\n\nThe story the NBA would like to tell about this year's Finals is Boston's Jayson Tatum vs. Dallas's Luka Doncic. Two cookie-cutter modern stars, neither of whom has ever offended a paying customer. Tatum is the smouldering one. Doncic is the goofy one. They'd make a decent buddy pair in a movie about gigantic men who become undercover detectives.\n\nIrving, 32, is the player people who work in the business of basketball would prefer to tuck behind Doncic or a pole or anything, really. Any time you get Irving behind a mic - if you can do that - it's a cancel-all-PR-leaves situation.\n\nIrving was a flat-earther before it was cool. Like a lot of pro athletes, he refused to get the COVID vaccine. Unlike a lot of those athletes, he wanted to talk about it. He's a conspiracy theory super fan, pushing stuff from Alex Jones and promoting a documentary accused of being antisemitic.\n\nThat last move brought the sharp end of the NBA hierarchy down on top of him. Irving admitted fault, but refused to apologize. It's a very American combo.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver met with him - code for offered him a chance to retreat with honour - but Irving refused again. His team, the Brooklyn Nets, suspended him. Irving remained immovable.\n\nIf Irving had been a backup point guard, he would by this point have been running a string of car washes. But because of those gifts, the NBA was willing to put up with just about anything he had to say.\n\nIrving never did apologize. The solution was a change of scenery. The Nets traded him to Dallas for a package of prospects.\n\nAt the time, the move was advertised as a disaster for Irving personally and the Mavericks institutionally. Plenty of teams have an albatross. Few go albatross shopping. In retribution for Irving's sins, Dallas would sink, pulling down Doncic with it.\n\nIn the 2022-23 season, mob justice prevailed. Irving arrived in February and the team got worse. It missed the playoffs.\n\nIn 2023-24, that storyline continued. Dallas was good, but middlingly so. Nobody rated its roster of shooters from distance and little else.\n\nThe Mavericks were supposed to lose in the first round against the L.A. Clippers. They didn't. They were really supposed to lose against everyone's second-favourite team, the Oklahoma City Thunder. They did not.\n\nBy the time the Mavericks hit the Minnesota Timberwolves, the worm was turning. Dallas was going from the casual fan's favourite meme dartboard to a team of destiny. Outside shooting? Who knew?\n\nLed by Doncic and Irving, Dallas flattened Minnesota in three games, then spent a couple more scraping it off the parquet.\n\nNow we've got LeBron James out there hailing Irving as the George Best or Shoeless Joe Jackson of basketball. The guy who has it all, but could have had even more. Irving has done the bare minimum to advance the theory that he's a changed man, but that's all it takes.\n\nAfter making the Finals, he discussed another one of his fractious job postings, in Boston. He was full of excuses (\"a little bit more grace could have been extended my way\"), but also gave everyone the headline they were looking for: \"I wasn't my best self during that time.\"\n\n\"He's really, really showing us the power of discovering inner peace,\" America's sports conscience, Stephen A. Smith, said afterward.\n\nNo, that's not what he's doing. What Irving is demonstrating is the obstructive capacity of success. Winning erects a wall between right now and whatever you did in the past. Winning creates a new you.\n\nIf Irving had come out and said the same thing after losing in the first round, people would have laughed at him. But saying it before a final series puts him in the position of the forgiver. The only thing the crowd likes better than being apologized to is being forgiven.\n\nThis is sport's real redemption arc. It can take someone everyone jeered a year ago and turn him into a Buddha-like figure who's accessed inner peace. All by winning a few playoff rounds.\n\nNo one has ever lawyered, accountanted or constuctioned their way to a higher plane. You can only play yourself there. It makes you wish you'd tried harder in gym class.\n\nThere are two possibilities for this year's Finals. Dallas wins, and Irving continues his ascent toward secular sporting beatification. Or Boston wins, and everyone ditches the 'Kyrie's changed' storyline for the next shiny thing.\n\nAll Irving has to do to keep things on track is win rather than talk, and never, ever post. History would suggest that his gifts do not extend that far.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Best", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Best"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoeless_Joe_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shoeless Joe Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

It's a certain point where it gets to be too much. I called it out, I just wanted to keep it strictly basketball. \"\n\nFast forward to the 2022 postseason and Kyrie's Nets faced the Celtics once again.\n\nThe TD Garden crowd rained down chants of \"F*** you Kyrie\" throughout Game 1 and Irving more than bit on the provocation, giving out the middle finger at least twice during the Celtics' 115-114 win.\n\nBefore an inbounds pass, Irving flashed both middle fingers to the crowd behind his head during the stoppage in play.\n\nIrving scored a team-high 39 points in the game.\n\nBut when one Celtics fan yelled 'Kyrie, you suck' as the Nets guard walked to the locker room, Irving snapped back, saying, \"suck my d***, b****\".\n\n\"When people start yelling 'p****' or 'b****' and 'f*** you' and all this stuff, there's only but so much you take as a competitor,\" Irving said.\n\n\"We're the ones expected to be docile and be humble, take a humble approach, f*** that, it's the playoffs. This is what it is ... So if somebody's going to call me out on my name, I'm gonna look at them straight in the eye and see if they really 'bout it. Most of the time they're not.\"\n\nA lot has happened between Kyrie and the Celtics in a relatively short space of time.\n\nGame 1 of this year's Finals will reveal whether it's water under the bridge or still a major sore point for Celtics fans.\n\nFor the new, mature Kyrie, though, things are a lot different.\n\nKyrie 2.0 is the calm veteran/closer for a relatively inexperienced Mavs team with one generational talent from Slovenia at its core.\n\nIrving, now 32, reflected on some of his low points with and against the Celtics in recent years, revealing he was in a dark place, due to off-court issues, during some of the more controversial outbursts.\n\n\"When we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds, and kind of lose my s*** a little bit, that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level,\" Irving told reporters this week.\n\n\"It wasn't a great reflection on my end toward the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment no matter what people are yelling at you. I'm built for these moments to be able to handle circumstances like that and I've been able to grow since then.\"\n\n\"I think I'm better at consolidating kind of the emotions now or being aware of what it's going to be like,\" he went on.\n\n\"We call it animosity, we call it hate, we call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.' I mean, there are real, live circumstances going on in the world that are bigger than the basketball, kind of the competitive side of things and answering those questions.\n\nIrving is expecting the upcoming games at TD Garden to be a 'hectic environment' but one that he is looking forward to.\n\n\"I see it as a healthy relationship with the fans,\" Irving said. \"I almost think about 'Gladiator' just win the crowd over. It's good to hear the TD Garden silent. When you're playing well they still respect great basketball, so regardless of the attention that's being paid to what it's going to be like on my end, I have a group to lead that's going to be looking to me for a voice of peace.\n\n\"And to be able to control what I can control and also help them through it. I'll take the brunt of it, of all the yells and stuff like that. All the remarks, but I've been able to grow since then and acknowledge that I can handle things better. Especially when I want to put a majority of my energy into playing well.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He has the best gifts I've ever seen of any NBA player.\"\n\nIn the NBA Finals, Irving and the Mavericks will take on the Boston Celtics. It's a matchup that has some added meaning for the eight-time All-Star, considering how poorly his tenure in Boston ended and the animosity the Celtics fan base still carries for him.\n\n\"I don't mind, after a few years, taking the brunt of the blame (for my time in Boston not working out),\" Irving said recently. \"(I'm) one of the best players in the world so I know what comes with that fair criticism.

He spent two seasons with the Celtics, ending on a sour note, and faced discouraging interactions when he returned. When the Brooklyn Nets played the Celtics in the playoffs a few seasons ago, the interactions between fans and Irving were negative.\n\nHe was fined for flipping off the crowd during his battles with Celtics fans in 2021 and 2022. Celtics fans are known for their loyalty, and when Irving initially expressed his desire to re-sign, they erupted with cheers. They already had a strong duo in Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum and believed Irving could be the missing piece. Irving praised Brown and Tatum earlier this week when asked about their progress.\n\n\"They've improved tremendously. I'm nothing short of proud of those guys. I left a lot of good wisdom with them. I tried to give as much advice as I could while I was in Boston.\"\n\n\"I'm one of the best players in the world, so I know what comes with that -- fair criticism,\" Irving told Cato. \"You know, it's just that a little more grace could have been extended my way, especially with what I was dealing with during that time as a human being. I know sometimes in sports, it's literally about the end goal and what you accomplish, and that's one thing. But we're still human. At the end of the day, I wasn't my best self during that time. When I look back on it, I see it as a time where I learned how to let go of things and learned how to talk through my emotions.\"\n\nIrving's statement shows maturity and acknowledges that he understands how Boston fans will react, and he is now better equipped to handle it than he was two years ago.\n\n\"I think I'm better at consolidating my emotions now or being aware of what it's going to be like,\" Irving said. \"We call it animosity, we call it hate, we call it 'It's going to be hell in Boston.' I mean, there are real, live circumstances in the world that are bigger than basketball, beyond the competitive side of things and answering those questions. But I will say last time in Boston, not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s*%$ a little bit -- that was not a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete at a high level. It wasn't a great reflection on my end towards the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment, no matter what people are yelling at you.\"\n\nWatching Irving these days, he is playing the game he loves with peace, similar to his former teammate LeBron James when he returned to Cleveland. It's a new version of Irving. He is playing on both sides of the ball and has found a way to be the best leader on a team that is still growing every game. Going into the Finals, Irving is averaging 23 points and five assists per game while shooting 48.5%, a career-best in the postseason.

With Irving's Mavericks beginning the NBA Finals on Thursday in Boston, he talked at length after the team's Monday practice about the unsuccessful partnership and the hostile reception he expects to receive from Celtics fans in TD Garden.\n\n\"I don't mind, after a few years, taking the brunt of the blame (for my time in Boston not working out),\" Irving said. \"(I'm) one of the best players in the world so I know what comes with that fair criticism. You know, it's just that a little bit more grace could have been extended my way, especially with what I was dealing with during that time as a human being.\n\n\"I know sometimes in sports, it's literally about the end goal and result in what you accomplish, and that's one thing. But we're still human. At the end of the day, I wasn't my best self during that time. When I look back on it, I just see it as a time where I learned how to let go of things and learned how to talk through my emotions.\"\n\nIrving arrived in Boston in 2017 following a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team where he won the 2016 NBA Finals next to LeBron James.\n\nAfter his surprise announcement in October 2018 that he planned to re-sign with the Celtics, he walked back that commitment months later, saying, \"I'm going to do what's best for my career,\" during a Boston shootaround in February 2019.\n\nAfter joining the Nets, Irving revealed his grandmother died prior to the 2018-19 season, which he said affected his on- and off-court performance. \"I failed those guys,\" he said at Brooklyn's media day in 2019. Now, looking back on the experience, Irving said his time with the Celtics taught him how to manage his emotions better.\n\n\"Moving on to the next thing, learning how to move and let go of the past,\" Irving said. \"It could cripple you if you allow it to. I've been bombarded with Boston questions since I left, people trying to figure out what actually happened, but I think the full story will come out probably when I'm retired or when it's appropriate.\"\n\nIrving specified a 2022 first-round series, where the Celtics swept his Nets, as a specific moment he regrets. His previous playoff returns to Boston have ended with tension.\n\nFollowing a Game 4 win by the Nets in the 2021 first round, Irving stepped on the Celtics half-court logo and a Boston fan was arrested after throwing a water bottle at Irving as he left the court. After a Game 1 Nets loss in 2022, Irving flashed his middle fingers to the crowd.\n\n\"Last time in Boston, when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (stuff) a little bit, that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level,\" Irving said. \"It wasn't a great reflection on my influence on the next generation, (with) what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment no matter what people are yelling at you.\"\n\nIrving has become better at \"consolidating those emotions now,\" he said Monday, which he believes will help him avoid moments like that in the upcoming games in Boston.\n\n\"I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that, and I've been able to grow since then,\" Irving said. \"Of course it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it. I see it as a healthy relationship to have with the fans. (I) think about gladiators. Just win the crowd over. It's good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well. They still respect great basketball.\n\n\"Regardless of the attention that's going to be paid to me on my end, I have a group to lead that's going to be looking at me for a voice of peace and to be able to control what I can control and also help them through it. So I'll take the brunt of it, of all the yells and stuff like that, all the remarks, but I've been able to grow since then. I just can handle things better especially when I want to put the majority of my energy towards playing well. I can't just be getting into it with fans like that, even though it may be fun at times, but it's a waste of energy. It's a waste of my time. It's also a waste of my talent trying to answer questions from the past that people have.\"\n\nIrving also said he has maintained a great relationship with his old Celtics teammates, which included Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, despite some reports that claimed otherwise.\n\n\"I think we've pretty much put it to bed (this idea) that a lot of my (former) teammates hate me,\" Irving said. \"I don't know what was being shared intimately with some of the media personnel that were reporting over the past few years (when) I first left Boston. But I've embraced all of those guys.\"\n\nTatum recently spoke on his relationship with Irving and reflected on their time together as teammates.\n\n\"Obviously it was some ups and downs,\" Tatum said. \"But I think for me, being a first-, second-year player being around a superstar essentially every day and seeing how to navigate that space and on the court he's one of the most talented guys I've ever seen. ... I've got a lot of great memories from having (Kyrie) as a teammate.\"\n\nWhile Irving described his relationship with Tatum, Brown and others as a brother-to-brother one, he hasn't had any conversations with them in the lead-up to this series.\n\n\"It's going to be adversarial on the court, it's going to be competitive, but off the court, we know each other's families, and that's the type of relationship I've always wanted outside of the game of basketball,\" Irving said. \"To compete with people on the court, and also to treat them like my brothers when they need me.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytlicensing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spokesman.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/upb2M3Ob1JbCvbMB2XqYmoto8PQ=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/06/04/665f8b1cf3bd7.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 1543, "textEnd": 1555}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-02-", "textStart": 1730, "textEnd": 1743}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The Mavericks have gotten to this point by taking down three separate 50-plus win teams in the vaunted Western Conference postseason bracket, and Irving turned his scoring up several notches in the Western Conference Finals to help overcome the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nIrving seems to be in a much more tranquil state of mind as of late with the Mavericks as compared to his previous two stops with the Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets. Of course, Irving's name entered the national consciousness initially for his work with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he first started out as a dynamic young point guard and then became the second best player on a championship team there after LeBron James rejoined the franchise ten years ago.\n\nAll of this begs the question as to which of Irving's stops around the league has been the most beneficial in his view, and his answer might surprise some Cleveland fans.\n\n\"This has been the greatest ... portion of my career,\" Irving said, per Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Spots. \"To be able to now give wisdom and also speak from a place of experience. When you're a young person, again, you're trying to speed through life, you're trying to get through everything.\"\n\nHe also spoke on how he and his Mavericks teammates are looking to carve out their own place in NBA immortality.\n\n\"You know, people remember the greatest players of all time, and they argue all the time, but no one really talks about team aspect unless they're a true fan of the craft,\" said Irving. \"You talk about the Spurs, you gotta talk about dynasty. You talk about the Lakers, you got to talk about dynasty. You talk about the Celtics, you talk about dynasty. They literally took over eras, the Detroit Pistons, they defined an era.\"\n\nCan the Mavericks pull off the upset?\n\nIrving is of course the number two option on the Mavericks to Luka Doncic, much as he was to James during his time with the Cavaliers. However, beyond Doncic in Irving, it would appear that the Celtics would have five out of the seven best players in this series, which is probably why they're the massive betting favorites as things get underway.\n\nIrving has squared off with the Celtics twice in the playoffs since leaving that organization in 2019. The first time occurred during the 2021 postseason, when the Irving-Kevin Durant-James Harden led Nets took down the Celtics, playing without Jaylen Brown, in five games. However, the following year, Boston got their revenge, shockingly sweeping Irving and Durant out of the postseason in four games in the very first round.\n\nIrving's trips back to Boston in the games he's played there since leaving have largely been defined by hostility from the Celtics crowd, which is likely to be the case once again this time, but it appears Irving is now more equipped to handle the hate and try to send a hush through the TD Garden.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kyrie-Irving-makes-greatest-career-admission-that-will-catch-Cavs-fans-attention.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

It's not something that's new. It's not like we've (haven't) seen it before we became teammates. We already know what to expect. We've got his back through thick and thin, whatever it is. I'm always there for him. I'm always there to talk to him whenever he needs me, just like everybody else is on this team. Kyrie ain't never going through anything alone.\"\n\nWhile Celtics fans will try to get under Irving's skin at every moment, the Mavericks are looking to keep their cool in what Luka Doncic admitted is a tough place to play. The fans relentlessly getting on Irving could actually end up galvanizing the Mavericks.\n\n\"I feel like the more hostile the environment is, the more closer we get as a team, able to lean on one another,\" Dereck Lively II said. \"Whenever there is a sea of green, we're going to lean on our brothers in blue.\"\n\nIrving earlier this week spoke with some regret about his immature actions in previous trips to Boston. In a 2022 first-round series while Irving was with the Brooklyn Nets, he flipped off the crowd and mocked them.\n\nBut Irving is doing his best to be unfazed by it all this time around. The Mavericks certainly need the 32-year-old guard on top of his game and not playing into any distractions with Irving averaging 22.8 points and shooting 42.1% from 3-point range in the postseason.\n\n\"I think Ky is going to play the game the way he knows he's supposed to play the game,\" Jones said. \"It's the NBA Finals, it's the biggest stage. He's been here before. He's performed at a high level on this stage before. We know what Ky's capable of and we expect that from him.\"\n\nThe Mavericks are ready for the crowd inside TD Garden to be screaming venom at Irving.

A day after LeBron James said he was angry about not being his teammate anymore, Irving returned the sentiment and expressed gratitude over their run together.\n\n\"I appreciate it, that's a lot of gratitude there as well,\" said Kyrie on LeBron's statement. \"I'm at a different age, a different place in my life and so was he. We've been able to mature and appreciate how much we've been able to accomplish.\"\n\nIrving, an 8x All-Star, broke up his partnership with James after just three years when he requested a trade from the Cavaliers in 2017. Irving was eventually sent to the Celtics in a multi-player deal for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic, and two draft picks. According to Irving, some things got in the way of their success together but they've both grown up enough over time to end the beef once and for all.\n\n\"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger,\" said Irving to reporters on Wednesday. \"Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man and be comfortable in it, I feel like our relationship is different because of that now.\"\n\nKyrie and LeBron (a 4x NBA champion) did not depart on good terms and I never thought they would reconcile after their split. But after a tumultuous tenure with the Nets and some major controversies over the span of a few years, Irving learned from his mistakes and it seems he's in a very different place now. It's a shame that the Lakers were never able to bring them back together.\n\nKyrie Irving Admits He Misses Playing With LeBron\n\nKyrie's career has been a wild ride of chaos and controversy but his work on the court has never faltered. Since joining the Mavericks, he's been one of the best guards in the West with averages of 26.0 points, 5.4 assists, and 5.0 rebounds per game on 50% shooting.\n\nEven in the Finals alongside superstar Slovenian scorer Luka Doncic, however, Irving still thinks about his days with the King. As the 32-year-old out of Duke explained to the media, having LeBron to back you up is a surreal experience that he will never forget.\n\n\"I definitely miss him,\" Kyrie said. \"Being able to run up and down the floor, just throw the ball to someone like that, as athletic as they come. There's that mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership and my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot that I will appreciate for the rest of my life.\"\n\nWhile a short-lived alliance, LeBron and Irving's run can only be counted as a success given that it came with three straight NBA Finals appearances and a championship victory over one of the greatest teams ever assembled.\n\nLeBron, now 39 years old, and Uncle Drew are likely never going to be reunited again on the basketball court, but I love the fact that they've come to embrace their time at the top together. What they accomplished in 2016 was nothing short of a miracle and it's a moment that stands out in the careers of both Irving and LeBron.\n\nHad they managed to stay together for longer, who knows what more the duo could have accomplished together? Sadly, it just wasn't meant to last at the time and one could argue that the way everything played out helped Kyrie become the man he is today -- a mature and steady presence in the locker room for the 2024 Western Conference champions.\n\nRelated: Lakers' Trade Package For Kyrie Irving Has Been Revealed; Mavericks Offered A Better Deal\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

The Celtics sent All-NBA second-teamer and top-five MVP finisher Isaiah Thomas to Cleveland along with wing Jae Crowder, center Ante Zizic and three draft picks -- including the Nets' 2018 first-round selection.\n\nIn return, the Celtics got star point guard Kyrie Irving.\n\nIrving was just 25 when he was traded to the Celtics, and the thought process on Boston's end was that he could be a great long-term fit next to Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Irving would give the team another young talent and a core that could contend for an NBA title for a decade-plus if all went well.\n\nHowever, all did not go well between the two parties. It went from a promising partnership in Year 1 to a contentious marriage that ended after just two seasons.\n\nOnce things went sour, Irving became a villain in Boston. That led to plenty of drama between Irving and Celtics fans as the Nets and Celtics squared off often during his time in Brooklyn.\n\nAnd now with Dallas, Irving's squad is what stands between the Celtics and an NBA-record 18th championship.\n\nHere's what to know about Irving's tenure with the Celtics and the rivalry that spawned from his Boston departure.\n\nNOH: Who will win the Celtics vs. Mavericks NBA Finals?\n\nBoston fans were looking forward to their second season of the Kyrie Irving era when he gave them a pleasant surprise on eve of the season.\n\nIrving expressed at a preseason fan event Oct. 4, 2018, that he planned to sign a new deal with the Celtics after the season.\n\n\"If you guys will have me back, I plan on re-signing here,\" Irving said to the Boston crowd, per NBA.com.\n\nIrving continued his praise of the Celtics the following day. He commended the team for \"taking a chance\" on him being the team's No. 1 star and expressed he enjoyed playing in Boston.\n\n\"I'm happy here,\" Irving said, per ESPN. \"Every single day is at an all-time competitive high. What more can you ask for from an organization than taking a chance as far as getting me out of Cleveland? Really taking a chance regardless of whether I signed back or not.\"\n\n\"They had the same attitude,\" he added. \"They just wanted to show me what being a Celtic is about, and that I was going to come around, and I absolutely did. I believe in it. I believe in the franchise.\"\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Irving also spoke about his appreciation for the Celtics' rich history. He expressed he wanted someday to see his jersey in the TD Garden rafters along with the plethora of Celtics greats to have their numbers retired.\n\nIrving endeared himself to Celtics fans with those comments, but those would stand as the last remnants of good feelings between Irving and the Boston faithful.\n\nThe Celtics got off to a difficult start during the 2018-19 NBA season. They went just 10-10 in their first 20 games despite many prognosticators presuming they would be better as Irving settled into his role and both Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown progressed.\n\nBoston gradually started to improve as the season went on, but there appeared to be growing tension within the team. Irving exhibited frustration at times, and that was never more apparent than his outburst following the Celtics' 105-103 loss to the Magic on Jan. 12, 2019.\n\nThe Celtics were trailing by two when Gordon Hayward sent an inbounds pass to Tatum with 2.9 seconds left on the clock. He missed a potential game-tying, mid-range fall away, and Irving didn't take kindly to Hayward's decision to give the ball to Tatum.\n\nIrving shouted at Hayward as the Celtics left the court.\n\nIrving wanted either a chance at the last shot or an opportunity to touch the ball on the final play. After Boston's loss, he spoke about how he differed from his teammates, blaming their lack of experience for some of the team's struggles to date.\n\nThat game led to a turning point in Irving's relationship with the Celtics, as things got colder as the season progressed.\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2019 -- just three weeks after Boston's loss to Orlando -- Irving walked back his commitment to rejoin the Celtics following the season.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I'm going to do what's best for my career,\" Irving said, per NBC Sports Boston. \"I spent the last eight years trying to do what everyone else wanted me to do -- managers, other personnel -- and I don't owe anybody s -- .\"\n\nIrving expressed he remained confident in the Celtics \"and what they can promise for the future.\" Still, he opened the door he had once shut by suggesting he could leave Boston.\n\nIrving was set to be an unrestricted free agent, so he had the right to choose his next destination. Nonetheless, his change of priorities made his preseason comments about wanting his number hung in the TD Garden rafters seem disingenuous to Celtics fans. That sparked the beginning of the rift between Irving and the Boston faithful.\n\nIrving went to the NBA All-Star Game about two weeks after his walk-back. There, he had a conversation with then-Warriors forward Kevin Durant. Speculation about the conversation ran rampant, with many believing the two could be talking about a potential team-up in Brooklyn.\n\nIrving was asked about the conversation and implied he was annoyed a private conversation between him and one of his best friends became a massive storyline.\n\n\"I don't have a private life when I'm out there in the NBA,\" Irving said, per The Boston Globe. \"Somebody wants to take a video, it is what it is. Pour water on [the speculation]? I'm a human being talking to another best friend of mine. It's just crazy.\n\n\"This is the stuff that just doesn't make the league fun. Nobody helps promote the league by doing [expletive] like that. Just fictitious, putting things on like what we're talking about, it's crazy. I guess that's what you want, huh?\"\n\nOf course, Irving eventually teamed up with Durant on the Nets following the 2018-19 NBA season. While he may not have discussed the possibility with Durant during their filmed conversation, the two players decided to play together at some point before each agreed to a lucrative, long-term extension in Brooklyn.\n\nMORE: Why the Celtics need a healthy Kristaps Porzingis to beat the Mavericks\n\nThe Celtics continued to stumble along in the Eastern Conference playoff race despite Irving's future remaining in doubt. They swept the Pacers in the first round of the 2019 NBA Playoffs before running into trouble in the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Bucks.\n\nBoston won its first game of the series 112-90, sparking hope that the Celtics could beat the Bucks. However, Milwaukee won the next four games consecutively, outscoring Boston by an average of 16.3 points per game.\n\nIrving struggled immensely across those four contests, making just 25 of 83 shots for a stagnant Celtics offense. He then headed to free agency and signed with the Nets to complete an exit that went from improbable to expected in mere months.\n\nIrving kicked off his media day availability in September 2019 by explaining his decision to join the Celtics. He revealed he wanted to be closer to his New Jersey home to be closer to his family after the death of his grandfather early in the 2018-19 NBA season.\n\n\"After he passed, basketball was the last thing on my mind,\" Irving said. \"A lot of basketball and the joy I had from it was sucked away from me. There was a facial expression that I carried around with me throughout the year. Didn't allow anyone to get close to me in that instance, and it really bothered me.\n\n\"I didn't take the necessary steps to get counseling or get therapy or anything to deal with someone that close to me dying. I've never dealt with anything like that. So, for me, I responded in ways that are uncharacteristic.\"\n\nIrving further detailed that he spoke to the Celtics about what he was going through. However, his desire to re-sign in Boston began to wane as he realized that basketball prevented him from seeing his grandfather before his death.\n\n\"I talked to Danny [Ainge] and I wanted to re-sign. So throughout the year, it started becoming more and more clear that my relationship within my home life had a way higher precedence than the organization or anyone,\" Irving said.\n\n\"A lot of the battles I thought I could battle through in the [Boston] team environment, I just wasn't ready for,\" he continued. \"And I failed those guys, in the sense that I didn't give them everything I could have during that season. ... In terms of me being a leader in that environment and bringing everyone together, I failed.\"\n\nIrving's explanation certainly provided an insight into his decision, and his admission that he \"failed\" his Celtics teammates showed he was willing to take some of the blame for the tumultuous split.\n\nStill, Boston fans were miffed hearing Irving \"didn't give them everything that [he] could have\" before his departure. That, along with his decision to join one of the Celtics' divisional rivals, further established him as a villain in the eyes of the Celtics faithful.\n\nIrving didn't play against the Celtics during his first season with the Nets, as a shoulder injury limited him to just 20 games during the COVID-impacted season. His first game at the TD Garden came in the preseason.\n\nFans weren't allowed into the contest because of COVID restrictions, but NBC Sports Boston's cameras captured video of Irving marching around the court burning sage.\n\nWhy was Irving doing that?\n\n\"It just comes from a lot of native tribes,\" Irving explained after the game, per CBS Sports.\n\n\"Being able to sage, just cleanse the energy, make sure that we're all balanced. When we come into this job, we come into this place, it's not anything that I don't do at home that I did today. I saged last game, and I plan to sage almost every game if the opposing team will allow me to.\n\n\"But, literally, it's more or less for us to stay connected and for us to feel great about going to work and feeling safe and provided for from our ancestors. I'm not going to bring too much of the spirituality into basketball, but yeah, it's part of my native culture where I'm from.\"\n\nFast forward a week, and Irving's Nets were once again at the TD Garden for a Christmas Day matchup. Irving fared well in that contest, which was played in front of an empty TD Garden. He scored 37 points with six rebounds and eight assists in a 123-95 Nets win.\n\nIrving said there was \"nothing added\" to his motivation in his first game against the Celtics since his departure.\n\n\"We're going to continue to see them,\" Irving told the Associated Press. \"We're in the same division.\"\n\nIrving's words rang true. The teams faced off in Brooklyn twice more in the 2020-21 regular season and met in the first round of the 2021 NBA Playoffs.\n\nMORE: Re-grading the Mavericks and Nets in the Kyrie Irving trade\n\nThe Nets won the first two games of their playoff series against the Celtics. The two teams were heading to the TD Garden for Games 3 and 4 of the series when Irving was asked what it would be like to play in front of Boston fans for the first time, as COVID restrictions were being lifted in Massachusetts.\n\nIrving's response? \"Hopefully, we can just keep it strictly basketball; there's no belligerence or racism going on -- subtle racism,\" Irving said, per ESPN's Malika Andrews. \"People yelling s -- from the crowd, but even if it is, it's part of the nature of the game and we're just going to focus on what we can control.\"\n\nIrving was asked whether he had been targeted by racist comments at the TD Garden before. He shrugged and said he \"was not the only one that can attest to this,\" per ESPN.\n\nIrving's comments became a hot topic before Game 3, with many recalling examples of racism in Boston sports from previous years. In January 2019, a fan who used \"racially offensive language\" toward Warriors center DeMarcus Cousins was banned from the TD Garden for two years.\n\nIn May 2017, then-Orioles centerfielder Adam Jones detailed \"one of the worst cases of fan abuse\" he had ever suffered during his career.\n\n\"A disrespectful fan threw a bag of peanuts at me,\" Jones said after the game in question, per USA Today's Bob Nightengale. \"I was called the N-word a handful of times tonight. Thanks. Pretty awesome.\"\n\nCeltics legend Bill Russell had his own troubles with racism among Boston fans during his lifetime. He once referred to the city as \"a flea market of racism.\"\n\nMarcus Smart revealed he was called a racist slur outside of the TD Garden in a personal essay published on The Players' Tribune in 2020, He backed up Irving's claims a couple of days after the former Celtic's comments about Boston.\n\n\"Yeah, I've heard it. I've heard a couple of things,\" Smart said of Boston fans making racist comments, per Yahoo Sports' Keith Smith. \"It's hard to hear that and then have them support us as players. It's kind of sad and sickening.\"\n\nIrving's first game in front of Boston fans -- played on May 28, 2021, with TD Garden at 25 percent capacity -- passed relatively incident-free. The Celtics won the contest 125-119 while the fans relentlessly jeered Irving.\n\nGame 4, however, was a different story.\n\nThe entire TD Garden was open for seating, and Irving's Nets won 141-126 to take a 3-1 series lead. Irving celebrated by greeting his teammates as they went to the locker room. He met them at halfcourt and stomped on the face of Lucky the Leprechaun -- the Celtics' long-time logo -- while he was out there.\n\nSports fans are often staunch defenders of their logos -- as we saw when Baker Mayfield planted his Oklahoma flag on the Ohio State logo -- so naturally, the Celtics faithful didn't take kindly to Irving's actions.\n\nEven Boston legend Cedric Maxwell was irked by Irving's stomp.\n\nWhile the incident wasn't anything major, it furthered the divide between Irving and the Celtics fan base and gave Boston more reason to treat him as the team's No. 1 enemy.\n\nPerhaps it also brought Irving some bad karma. He is just 1-10 against Boston since he stomped on Lucky's face.\n\nThe more major incident from the aftermath of Game 4 occurred when a Celtics fan hurled a water bottle at Irving as he was leaving the court. The bottle whistled just by Irving's head, and he and his then-teammate Tyler Johnson turned angrily to the crowd to berate the man who threw it.\n\nBelow is a look at the incident, per YES.\n\nIrving was understandably upset with what happened and sounded off about the fan's actions after the game.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that sports has come to a lot of this kind of crossroads where you're seeing a lot of old ways come up,\" Irving told reporters. \"It's been that way in history in terms of entertainment, performers and sports for a long period of time, just underlying racism and just treating people like they're in a human zoo.\n\n\"Throwing stuff at people and saying things. It's a certain point where it gets to be too much. I called it out, I just wanted to keep it strictly basketball. But then you just see people just feel very entitled out here. They paid for their tickets -- great, I'm grateful that they're coming in to watch a great performance.\n\n\"But we're not at the theater. We're not throwing tomatoes and other random stuff at the people that are performing. It's just too much.\"\n\nIrving wasn't the only player targeted by opposing fans during the 2021 postseason, which saw many fans return to arenas as COVID restrictions were lifted. A 76ers fan dumped popcorn on Russell Westbrook during Game 2 of the 76ers vs. Wizards series. A Knicks fan spat at Trae Young as the Hawks star began a rivalry with the New York faithful.\n\nMeanwhile, Jazz fans made racist and vulgar comments to the family of Ja Morant in the first two games of their series with the Grizzlies.\n\nStill, the Celtics fan's actions were unacceptable, and the TD Garden took them seriously. The fan -- 21-year-old Cole Buckley of Braintree, Mass. -- was arrested and charged with assault and battery using a dangerous weapon. He also received a life-long ban from the venue.\n\nAnd his actions further damaged the reputation of Boston fans, which had already taken a hit with Irving's comments earlier in the week.\n\nBoston fans and Irving went nearly a year between the water bottle toss and Irving's next return to the TD Garden. He played just once in four chances against the Celtics during the 2022 regular season -- a 126-120 Celtics win -- but the Nets and Celtics once again faced off in the postseason. This time, Boston was favored to make a championship run.\n\nIrving got the unceremonious welcome he had come to expect in Boston, but he was clearly bothered by it in Game 1 of the 2022 postseason. It didn't impact his performance -- he scored 39 points against the Celtics -- but he let the fans get in his head a bit.\n\nIrving flipped off the Celtics fans at the TD Garden at least twice during the Celtics' 115-114 victory. He explained after the game he decided to give the fans \"the same energy\" they were giving to him.\n\n\"When people start yelling 'p -- y' or 'b -- ' and 'f -- you' and all this stuff, there's only but so much you take as a competitor,\" Irving said, per ESPN. \"We're the ones expected to be docile and be humble, take a humble approach, f -- that, it's the playoffs. This is what it is.\"\n\nIrving was fined $50,000 by the NBA for \"making obscene gestures on the playing court and directing profane language toward the spectator stands.\" He was much calmer in Game 2 but scored just 10 points in a seven-point Nets loss.\n\nThat was the last game Irving played in Boston during the 2022 NBA postseason. The Celtics swept the Nets to win the first-round series.\n\nMORE: Jayson Tatum reflects on Kyrie Irving's time with the Celtics\n\nIrving's games against the Celtics during the next two regular seasons were relatively drama-free, but now, he is set to square off with his former squad in the NBA Finals.\n\nThings are a lot different for Irving now. He was traded to the Mavericks before the 2023 NBA trade deadline and has since become a dynamic backcourt partner for Luka Doncic.\n\nHe also has reflected on some of his low points during his time with the Celtics and playing against them. He said he has received some \"fair criticism\" of his short, two-year tenure in Boston.\n\n\"I know sometimes in sports, it's literally about the end goal and result and what you accomplish, and that's one thing,\" Irving said, per ESPN. \"But we're still human at the end of the day. I wasn't my best self during that time. When I look back on it, I just see it as a time where I learned how to let go of things and learned how to talk through my emotions.\n\n\"It was just a chapter in my life that I got to enjoy for the most part. We had a great opportunity to do some special things, but it was cut short, just based off personal reasons on my end.\n\n\"One thing I look back on my time in Boston -- I've said this over the past few years, but somehow it gets tossed under the rug -- but the greatest thing I learned from Boston was just being able to manage not only my emotions or just what's going on on a day-to-day basis of being a leader of a team or being one of the leaders, and having young guys around you that have their own goals, but you have to learn how to put the big picture first.\"\n\nIrving also admitted he now regrets his behavior during his trip to the TD Garden during the 2022 postseason.\n\n\"I think I'm better at consolidating kind of the emotions now or being aware of what it's going to be like,\" he said. \"We call it animosity, we call it hate, we call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.' I mean, there are real, live circumstances going on in the world that are bigger than the basketball, kind of the competitive side of things and answering those questions.\n\n\"But I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s -- a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level. It wasn't a great reflection on my end towards the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment, no matter what people are yelling at you.\n\n\"I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that, and I've been able to grow since then. So of course it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship that I have with the fans. I almost think about 'Gladiator,' just winning the crowd over. It is good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well. They still respect great basketball.\"\n\nThus, it seems Irving is ready to let bygones be bygones. Celtics fans may not be there yet -- and they may never get there, at least not as long as Irving is playing -- but perhaps the guard's admission will start to smooth things over as the fifth anniversary of Irving's departure arrives.\n\nIf not, Irving will have a chance to add another chapter to his story as one of Boston's biggest sports villains by leading Dallas to an NBA Finals win.",

Irving and James' potential as a duo was cut short by Irving's premature exit from Cleveland. Irving reflects on their relationship, expressing regret for what could have been if they had continued playing together.\n\nKyrie Irving's resurgence as a relevant, winning basketball player has been one of the most fun storylines of the 2024 Playoffs. After seven disappointing seasons since leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2017, Irving has found a great situation as a Dallas Maverick next to new superstar teammate Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nIrving's old legendary running mate with the Cavaliers, LeBron James, has taken note. On the Mind The Game podcast with James and J.J. Redick, the star forward reminisced about the three years he spent next to Irving in Cleveland as they made three NBA Finals and won the most memorable championship of the century over the 73-win Golden State Warriors.\n\nJames lamented Irving's untimely exit from Cleveland, wishing he was still playing alongside the magic that is Kyrie Irving. Today, the Dallas star responded to those comments with equally regretful meaning.\n\n\"I would call Kyrie 'The Wizard' all the time. All the time. There was nothing on a basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do. Sitting here watching it, I'm so f****** happy and so f****** proud to watch his growth. At the same time, I'm so f****** mad that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nIt is unclear what Irving is referring to about their relationship, but it was undoubtedly a premature exit.\n\nKyrie And LeBron Were A Legendary Duo They fit extremely well and accomplished some great feats\n\nNBA fans everywhere share the sentiment of James and Irving themselves, as three years and one championship didn't meet the potential of this duo if they stayed together for the long run. The pairing could still be playing in Cleveland to this day, and who knows what they could have accomplished over the past seven years. One thing is near certain, however; both James and Irving would be better off right now if they stayed together.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some of their best moments as a tandem. Their crowning accomplishment is coming back from a 3-1 deficit against the best regular season team of all time, the 73-9 Warriors. The three games Cleveland won to secure its first championship are perhaps the best three-game stretch by a duo in NBA history, where James and Irving combined for 199 points.\n\n2016 Game 5 will go down in history as the turning point of that series, where both guys scored 41 points and put on an incredible masterpiece of shotmaking to wear down the Warriors juggernaut. To this day, younger NBA fans will remember this game as the peak of basketball performance by two individuals, and even Stephen Curry admits \"it was the best basketball he's ever seen\".\n\nAlthough they didn't win another title together, the two were dynamic throughout all three of their playoff runs, boasting a historically great offense at the time. Irving's injury in Game 1 of the 2015 Finals will go down as one of the biggest what-ifs of James' career, and it is a shame the duo didn't get many more chances to hoist the trophy.\n\nIrving has found a home in Dallas, essentially ending any chance of a reunion before James retires, but the three seasons they gave us at their peak will always be appreciated.\n\nRelated Kyrie Irving Calls Mavericks Tenure 'Greatest Portion of My Career' Irving has always been a supremely gifted scorer, but in Dallas he's mastered the art of leadership.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-05-jun-2024-03-36-pm-143.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

When Irving played in Boston and Brooklyn, he had some heavy criticisms from Celtics fans.\n\nThree years later, he's returning to Boston as a member of the Dallas Mavericks to face his former team in the NBA Finals and the fans he once called out for their \"subtle racism\" towards him and his teammates.\n\nIrving spent two years playing for the Boston Celtics before leaving to join Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets in 2019.\n\nThe next year, Irving and the Nets met the Celtics in the NBA Playoffs where they took a convincing 2-0 lead in the seven-game series. Before the series headed to Boston, Irving expressed to the media that he hoped his return to Boston wasn't tainted by fans being racist.\n\n\"Hopefully we can just keep it strictly basketball,\" Irving said during the post-game press conference. \"There's no belligerence or racism going on, subtle racism, and people yelling [expletive] from the crowd. Even if it is, it's part of the nature of the game and we're just going to focus on what we can control.\"\n\nKyrie added about his claims of racism in Boston: \"I'm not the only one who could attest to this . . . but it's just, it is what it is. The whole world knows it.\"\n\nDuring the next two games in Boston, Kyrie had multiple interactions with angry Celtics fans, including a fan being arrested for throwing a water bottle at him after Brooklyn's Game 4 win.\n\nBut it didn't stop there.\n\nIn 2022, Irving was fined $50,000 for flashing his middle finger at Boston fans during the Nets' Game 1 playoff loss in 2022, according to ESPN.\n\nNow, Irving, who seems to be happy and thriving in his new environment said he had regrets about past interactions with Boston fans and is in a better place emotionally.\n\n\"I think I'm better at consolidating kind of the emotions now or being aware of what it's going to be like,\" Irving told ESPN after the Mavericks' Monday practice. \"We call it animosity, we call it hate, we call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.' I mean, there are real, live circumstances going on in the world that are bigger than the basketball, kind of the competitive side of things and answering those questions.\"\n\nHe continued, \"But I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s -- a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level. It wasn't a great reflection on my end towards the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment, no matter what people are yelling at you.\"\n\nIrving also acknowledged his growth as a human since his short tenure in Boston and says he looks forward to the challenge.\n\n\"I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that, and I've been able to grow since then. So of course it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship that I have with the fans. I almost think about 'Gladiator,' just winning the crowd over. It is good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well. They still respect great basketball.\"\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n2024 NBA Finals Feature 2 Black Head Coaches For Just 3rd Time, Technically\n\nExploring The History Of The NBA's Lack Of Black Ownership\n\nThe post NBA Finals: Kyrie Irving Faces Celtics 3 Years After Calling Out Boston's Anti-Black Racism appeared first on NewsOne.\n\nNBA Finals: Kyrie Irving Faces Celtics 3 Years After Calling Out Boston's Anti-Black Racism was originally published on newsone.com", "source": {"uri": "blackamericaweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Black America Web"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bilal_g_morris@blackamericaweb.com", "name": "Bilal G.

Irving was dealt to Boston and a couple of seasons later, the two stars developed a deeper appreciation for each other when Irving reconnected with James for guidance on how to lead the young Celtics the way the four-time MVP had led the Cavs.\n\nLast season, the Los Angeles Lakers were one of several teams to aggressively pursue Irving leading up to the trade deadline before the Brooklyn Nets ultimately sent him to Dallas in a package that included Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, an unprotected first-round pick in 2029 and two second-round picks. The Lakers' offer centered on Russell Westbrook and two future first-round picks in 2027 and 2029, sources told ESPN.\n\nJames, who openly lobbied for L.A. to acquire Irving, lamented the point guard landing with the Mavs at the time.\n\n\"I can't sit here and say I'm not disappointed on not being able to land such a talent, but [also] someone that I had great chemistry with, and know I got great chemistry with on the floor, that can help you win championships, in my mind, in my eyes,\" James told ESPN's Michael Wilbon last February.\n\nWhile the Celtics are the favorites in the Finals (-225, according to ESPN BET), James said that Irving's presence makes the Mavericks more than just an underdog. Specifically, James said Irving's performance in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals, when the 13-year veteran scored 24 of his 30 points in the first half to jump on the Minnesota Timberwolves, made him reconsider Dallas' chances this postseason.\n\n\"That was like, 'Oh s---, Dallas may be able to not only win the Western Conference finals, they might be able to win the whole thing,'\" James said. \"Because of that [Irving] wild card. ... He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nIrving, 32, is averaging 22.8 points on 48.5% shooting (42.1% from 3) with 5.2 assists, 3.9 rebounds and 1.2 steals per game this postseason as the Mavs' No. 2 option behind Luka Doncic.\n\n\"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card,\" James said. \"It's like having a Draw 4 in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_mcmenamin@espn.com.sg", "name": "Dave McMenamin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Dinwiddie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Dinwiddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_Finney-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dorian Finney-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wilbon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Wilbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Guides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0117%2Fr1278509_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

In their three seasons as teammates, Cleveland reached the NBA Finals three times. The pair won the 2016 championship together, and were it not for Irving's injury in 2015 and a once-in-a-lifetime cap spike allowing Kevin Durant to join the Golden State Warriors in time for the 2017 series, they easily could have won three consecutive titles together. While both have enjoyed individual success since separating, neither has won nearly as consistently without the other.\n\nJames has, on a number of occasions, come close to reuniting with Irving. The Los Angeles Lakers have pursued him several times. Last summer, Irving reportedly wanted James to join him with the Dallas Mavericks. Those deals never materialized, and now Irving is set to play in the NBA Finals as a member of the Mavericks. James is enjoying watching his former teammate flourish, but at the same time, he won't deny how much he misses playing with his former protege.\n\n\"There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do,\" James explained on his Mind the Game podcast with JJ Redick. \"And sitting here watching it, I'm like, I'm playing like, so f******* happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth and whatever the case may be, and at the same time, I am so f******* mad at the same time that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nJames said he was \"disappointed\" when the Lakers failed to land Irving at the 2023 deadline, and it's not hard to see why. The Lakers have spent virtually the entire James era looking for a long-term point guard to do for James what Irving once did. They've failed on smaller additions like Dennis Schroder and D'Angelo Russell. They've failed with bigger ones like Russell Westbrook. No guard aside from Dwyane Wade has ever paired more perfectly with James. Irving eased the scoring burden on his former running mate, and James ensured that he wouldn't have to focus as much on the playmaking that has never come quite as easily to him. That's one of the few things that doesn't come naturally to Irving because, according to James, his former point guard is \"the most gifted player\" in NBA history.\n\n\"I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with absolutely none, because it's just, it's so, he's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen,\" James said. \"He has the best gifts I've ever seen of any NBA player. I've never seen a guy in my NBA life that feels better at times shooting with his off-hand than he does with his primary hand. If Kyrie's off in a game with his right hand, he will literally go exclusively to his left hand. I've never seen nothing like that.\"\n\nThat is high praise coming from anyone, but especially James, who himself is routinely considered the most physically gifted player in NBA history. Those two notions can coexist. James has physical tools no NBA player has ever had, but Irving has a combination of skills and moves on the ball that have never been matched. Together, the two formed one of the most potent offensive duos the league will ever see. It only lasted three years, but if James had his way, it would have lasted a whole lot longer.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Angelo_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D'Angelo Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Schr\u00f6der", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Schr\u00f6der"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/04/2c2e9195-067f-4af6-a1df-c35e3d17b5d8/thumbnail/1200x675/59c5e176202d251e4b3f54218d4f8019/lebron-james-kyrie-irving-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Irving was supposed to be the superstar to take the Celtics' young core over the top in pursuit of a championship, but the team never reached the potential that it had on paper.\n\nAfter two seasons of injuries and on- and off-court issues, Irving elected to leave Boston in free agency despite making promises that he'd stay. Here's what led to the falling out of his time with the Celtics.\n\nMORE: Jayson Tatum gets candid about Irving's disappointing Celtics run\n\nInjuries plagued the Celtics during Irving's first season in Boston. All-Star forward Gordon Hayward went down with a season-ending leg injury in the first game, then Irving underwent season-ending knee surgery just over a week before the playoffs started.\n\nThe Celtics still reached Game 7 of the 2018 Eastern Conference Finals without their two All-Stars, as rookie Jayson Tatum and second-year Jaylen Brown began to emerge into the players they would become today. That left confusion in the locker room as the team suddenly had too many mouths to feed from a scoring standpoint.\n\nIrving entered a contract year in 2018-19 and decided not to sign an extension before the start of the season. Despite that decision, he pledged his loyalty to Boston during a preseason fan event that led Celtics faithful to believe he'd re-sign at the end of the year.\n\n\"If you guys will have me back, I plan on re-signing here,\" Irving told the TD Garden crowd.\n\nHe doubled down in an interview with the media the following day, saying he wanted his number retired in Boston.\n\n\"I have every intention of signing with Boston next year. I do have a dream of putting my No. 11 in the rafters one day if I'm so blessed to do that. ... No disrespect to any other organizations, but here was a perfect fit,\" Irving said.\n\nMORE: Why Celtics need a healthy Kristaps Porzingis to beat Mavericks\n\nThe season did not end up being all roses the way Irving or the Celtics had hoped.\n\nIrving quickly became irritated with the situation and Boston media. He called out the lack of veteran leadership on the roster after a poor stretch to start the season in November, then specifically targeted the younger players in a postgame rant in January.\n\nBy February, Irving was already walking back his comments about wanting to re-sign in Boston.\n\n\"I'm going to do what's best for my career,\" Irving said. \"I don't owe anybody sh -- .\"\n\nAfter a rough playoff performance and second-round exit, the writing was on the wall that Irving would not be returning to the Celtics. He later admitted he had a lot going on outside of basketball -- including a death in his family -- that led to his chaotic second season in Boston.\n\nCeltics fans have still not forgiven Irving for double-crossing his preseason promise, though.\n\nIrving's time with the Celtics isn't painted very fondly, but his stats might be better than you remember.\n\nIrving was an All-Star starter in both seasons with the Celtics and made All-NBA Second Team in 2018-19.\n\nHis playoff performance was one to forget, though.\n\nAfter missing the entire 2018 NBA Playoffs with the Celtics due to injury, Irving had one of the worst postseason performances of his career in 2019. He posted playoff career lows in field goal and 3-point percentage and averaged a playoff career-high in turnovers. The Celtics swept the Pacers in the first round but were handled by the Bucks in five games in the second round.\n\nMORE: Giving new grades to Mavericks, Nets for Kyrie Irving trade\n\nAfter the 2019 NBA Playoffs, it became clear that Irving and the Celtics were not the right fit.\n\nThe star guard wasted no time to cross his statements about returning to Boston from the start of the season. On the first day of free agency, he signed a four-year, $141 million contract with the Nets to join forces with his friend, Kevin Durant.\n\nThe news of Brooklyn's new star duo was announced in one tweet from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nIrving remained with the Nets for three and a half seasons until he was moved to the Mavericks at the 2023 trade deadline.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Hayward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/nba-plain--0f7d1c04-b882-48af-aeeb-4bb659743cca.jpeg?itok=OER_JDOk", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Mavs general manager Nico Harrison used to work for Nike, and coach Jason Kidd was the point guard of the then-New Jersey Nets when Irving was growing up in that area.\n\nIrving caught up with the team in Los Angeles after the trade, and the Mavericks won their first two games with him.\n\n\"You could see the smile,\" Kidd said. \"You could see the relief, or you could see that he was ready to have fun and play the game that he loves.\"\n\nThe partial season together didn't work out for Irving and Doncic. Dallas missed the playoffs. The first full season together was what the Mavs expected when they pulled off Harrison's first blockbuster trade.\n\nA late-season surge lifted the Mavs to fifth in the West, although they've been the lower seed throughout these playoffs.\n\nDallas beat the Los Angeles Clippers in six games in the first round, ousting Tyronn Lue, Irving's coach from his championship season alongside LeBron James in Cleveland in 2016.\n\n\"He's very, very patient,\" Lue said after that series of the difference between the Irving he coached and today's version. \"You couldn't get this Kyrie when I had him. He wants to kill you every moment, every second. But now you can see, he's just letting the game come to him.\"\n\nThe Mavs beat top-seeded Oklahoma City in six games before knocking out No. 3 Minnesota in five games in the Western Conference finals, the clincher giving Dallas a five-game road winning streak in the playoffs.\n\n\"I feel like it's a great chapter that's being written right now,\" Irving said. \"I'm enjoying every step of the way. I'm not taking anything for granted. I'm enjoying the hot weather right now. I'm enjoying the Dallas community. We talked about this early in the season, just how much I felt embraced.\"\n\nIrving went on to say it went deeper than that, reminding reporters of an entire career spent in the other conference.\n\n\"Seasonal depression is real when you're growing up in the north,\" Irving said. \"I spent 12 years in the Eastern Conference in three cold cities that deal with four seasons. So you come out here and you're able to get outside and ground yourself a little bit more and spend some time with your family. Watch your kids run outside.\"\n\nIrving and Doncic have at least another season together. Irving has a player option for 2025-26, Doncic for the season after that.\n\nKidd believes a preseason trip to Madrid, where Doncic grew as a teenaged pro in the EuroLeague, helped the two superstars bond.\n\nNow, winning is cementing that bond, one of the most poignant moments for the pair coming in the final seconds of Game 3 against the Timberwolves, after the Mavs knew they had clinched a 3-0 lead.\n\n\"When we were winning by nine on that last possession, I told (Irving), 'I'm tired,' and he told me, 'That's the way it's supposed to be,'\" Doncic said. \"He brought the calmness to the team and to me. He brought the maturity. I'm learning from him every day.\"\n\nThere might not have been many teammates lining up to say those things in Irving's first three stops, and the magnitude looms larger with the words coming from the face of the Dallas franchise.\n\nEven though his relationships with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and some of his other former Boston teammates are fine, Irving believes he is a better teammate now than he was then.\n\n\"The greatest thing I learned from Boston was just being able to manage not only my emotions, but just what's going on on a day-to-day basis of being a leader of a team or being one of the leaders and having young guys around you that have their own goals,\" Irving said. \"You have to learn how to put the big picture first.\"\n\nA more introspective Irving is on the big stage again, and knows what's coming from the crowd in Boston.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Kyrie Irving's ability to 'work through' boos will be tested in Garden", "body": "BOSTON -- With Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks upon us, it's going to be a tough job for the bull gang at TD Garden to clear away all those rose petals being laid at Kyrie Irving's feet.\n\nOf course, Thursday night's Garden crowd will be happy to help out with that assignment. More about that in a moment. First, though, a quick summation of Nice Things Being Said About Irving, Pre-Game 1 edition:\n\n* During Wednesday's media availabilities at the Garden, Mavericks megastar Luka Don\u010di\u0107 marveled at the shots Irving takes in practice and then re-marveled at the in-game shots: \"The things he even tries in the game, it's insane,\" Don\u010di\u0107 said. \"I don't see nobody trying those shots.\"\n\n* On the Boston side, Irving's former Celtics teammate Jaylen Brown said the time they spent together \"was great\" and that he \"definitely learned a lot from Kyrie while he was here.\"\n\nAnd for those interested in a not-connected-to-the-finals observation, LeBron James has weighed in. Just the other day he called his former Cleveland Cavaliers teammate \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nIrving was asked about that last one, that Jamesian bouquet, when he spoke with the media Wednesday. \"Oh, God, I love it,\" Irving said, smiling. \"Got to love this, man.\"\n\nAnd yet we all know how Irving will be treated by the Garden masses Thursday night: They're going to boo and holler every time he touches the ball. And that, folks, is a reality in professional sports. Yes, booing takes many forms. Fans boo hometown heroes who are either slumping or perceived as not hustling. It happened to Red Sox legend Carl Yastrzemski back in the day, as was referenced by former Celtics coach Rick Pitino on that night in 2000 when he made his never-to-be-forgotten speech about how \"Larry Bird's not walking through that door, fans. Kevin McHale's not walking through that door, and Robert Parish is not walking through that door. And if you expect them to walk through that door, they're going to be gray and old.\"\n\nVillains? Yes, the villains get crushed. Bruins fans can help out here by citing Ulf Samuelsson and Matt Cooke for the career-altering hits they put on Cam Neely and Marc Savard.\n\nBoston fans have booed former stars who had the temerity to sign with other teams, with Johnny Damon (Red Sox) and Adam Vinatieri (Patriots) coming to mind. But it's tricky how it works sometimes: Red Sox outfielder Manny Ramirez flat-out quit playing, thus forcing a trade, and yet his returns to Fenway for various alumni events and commemorations have been met with overwhelming approval.\n\nIrving is different. That's partly because Ramirez helped deliver two championships during his Boston tenure. Irving delivered nothing. But it might also be because, if you believe what Irving is saying, it was a different Kyrie Irving who played for the Celtics. Irving, remember, was obtained for the explicit purpose of helping the Celtics to another NBA championship. A first-round pick was involved in making that happen. Irving seemed to buy in. Who'll ever forget that Hallmark special of a Nike TV commercial in which Irving is shown playing one-on-one with his dad on the sainted Garden parquet? In a voice-over, Irving says: \"He's the reason I wear No. 11. I want to be the reason no one else will.\"\n\nSo there it was, Irving putting it out there that one day his number will be up there in the Garden rafters with Bill Russell's No. 6, Larry Bird's No. 33, the Cooz's No. 14 and so on. After two seasons, no championships and a whole lot of disconnection -- such as that time he said, \"I'm going to do what's best for my career\" -- Irving decided that what was best for his career was signing with the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nThe whole thing was a mess, and Irving has been given villain status. And he's been hearing about it at the Garden ever since. Mostly it's been just that, very loud but very old-school booing, but there was also that kid who tossed a water bottle, which was silly, juvenile, reckless and, let's add, potentially dangerous.\n\nBut listening to Irving speak Wednesday, one wonders whether over the years he has ... what? Mellowed? Matured? Where are we here? Here's some of Irving from Wednesday:\n\n\"You've just got to breathe through it,\" he said, referring to the expected cascade of booing. \"To all my young'ins out there who are dealing with some of the crowd reactions and what they're saying to you, you have to breathe and realize that this is not as hostile as you think it is. I've been able to work through that and realize that some of that is anxiety and some of that is nervousness, and it can all be turned into a strength.\"\n\nThe easy takeaway there is that the louder people boo, the better Irving is going to play ... that is, turn it into a strength. The better takeaway, though, is his observation about being able to \"work through\" things and dealing with \"anxiety.\" Which brings us to something Irving said earlier in the week about his Boston days.\n\n\"I know sometimes in sports, it's literally about the end goal and result in what you accomplish, and that's one thing,\" he said. \"But we're still human. At the end of the day, I wasn't my best self during that time. When I look back on it, I just see it as a time where I learned how to let go of things and learned how to talk through my emotions.\"\n\nThere's a lot there in that one quote. There's Irving, saying he wasn't his best self during that time. There's Irving, saying he learned how to let go of things and \"talk through my emotions.\"\n\nBut he's still going to get booed in Boston on Thursday night, probably louder than ever. It is, after all, the NBA Finals, not the National Spelling Bee. And booing, when done within reason, comes with the price of the ticket. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nBut again, if you believe the words Irving is speaking now -- a big if, that one -- it means the crowd will be booing a guy who doesn't exist anymore.",

He seemed so thrilled after finally getting his wish to move on from the Cavaliers.\n\nREAD MORE: The Celtics gave up more in the Irving trade than any team had in years at that point\n\nAnd with the way Irving and everyone else talked about the team throughout that season, it just seemed like a foregone conclusion that he'd be a Celtic for the rest of his life.\n\nAlas. Here we are. Irving is a Dallas Maverick and will go up against his former team in the NBA Finals this year. Not only that, but people in Boston absolutely hate Irving at this point.\n\nSome of you are probably wondering how we got here. What on Earth made Kyrie decide to leave Boston? Don't you worry, folks. We got you.\n\nLet's dig into it.\n\nIrving's first year with Boston didn't go as planned\n\nIrving's first year with the Celtics was solid. Despite losing Gordon Hayward to a catastrophic leg injury, Boston was still the best team in the Eastern Conference as a 53-win team.\n\nThe injury bug bit again, though. Irving missed the end of the year because of an infection on the same knee he'd had a patellar fracture on in 2015. Despite him missing time, though, the Celtics still made a run to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nIrving told fans he would stay\n\nThings got a bit tense through the summer because of Irving's refusal to sign a contract extension with the Celtics. It made sense because he'd make more money hitting the open market and re-signing in Boston, but it still had fans on edge.\n\nLeading into the season, though, he sounded committed. He even told fans and the team he planned on re-signing in Boston.\n\nHe even starred in a Nike commercial with his dad about hanging his jersey in the rafters at TD Garden someday.\n\nObviously, none of that happened because things changed.\n\nBoston's chemistry was off\n\nAs Boston got deeper into the season, it was clear there was a chemistry problem with the team. Something wasn't clicking.\n\nIrving tried to take on a leadership role with the team as one of the veteran players on the squad, but it backfired on him. He called out the young players on the team and completely lost the locker room.\n\nIrving switched up\n\nShortly after this, by February, Irving had changed his tune about re-signing with Boston. He was asked whether he'd be back and said \"Ask me July 1.\" That's a totally different tone than \"I plan on re-signing here.\"\n\nHe also met with Kevin Durant later that year at the All-Star game where Durant later admitted the two were \"solidified\" in teaming up at this point.\n\nAt this point, it was over in Boston for Irving.\n\nIrving said \"personal factors\" made him change his mind\n\nBoston flames out of the playoffs against Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks. Irving signs with Brooklyn later that summer.\n\nHe was asked why he changed his mind later on in his introductory press conference with Brooklyn and explained his rationale. To make a long story short, he said some \"personal\" things were going on in his life that made him change his mind.\n\n\"Nine months ago, I was sitting in front of the Boston crowd saying that I wanted to re-sign. And after that, a lot of things happened in my personal life that really changed the landscape of how I felt about the game of basketball and actually playing it in a team environment. That really affected me as a human being. I didn't share it with anyone. I didn't want to come out and say that this is bothering me, or I'm in a depression at this point of dealing with the death of my grandfather.\n\nSo when all this happened, and the NBA and the 'pressures,' I'll put it in quotations, from this basketball game came into free agency and I was dealing with my future, I wanted to dispel all those things, but I don't think I did it in the right way of being honest about how I felt.\"\n\nThe rest is history.\n\nHere's how the Celtics and Mavericks stacked up against each other in the 2024 regular season Here's how Grant Williams could get a championship ring from the Celtics-Mavericks NBA Finals The Lakers are reportedly targeting Dan Hurley as coach and fans were stunned at the turn of events", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

Mavs general manager Nico Harrison used to work for Nike, and coach Jason Kidd was the point guard of the then-New Jersey Nets when Irving was growing up in that area.\n\nIrving caught up with the team in Los Angeles after the trade, and the Mavericks won their first two games with him. \"You could see the smile,\" Kidd said. \"You could see the relief, or you could see that he was ready to have fun and play the game that he loves.\"\n\nThe partial season together didn't work out for Irving and Doncic. Dallas missed the playoffs. The first full season together was what the Mavs expected when they pulled off Harrison's first blockbuster trade.\n\nA late-season surge lifted the Mavs to fifth in the West, although they've been the lower seed throughout these playoffs.\n\nDallas beat the Los Angeles Clippers in six games in the first round, ousting Tyronn Lue, Irving's coach from his championship season alongside LeBron James in Cleveland in 2016.\n\n\"He's very, very patient,\" Lue said after that series of the difference between the Irving he coached and today's version. \"You couldn't get this Kyrie when I had him. He wants to kill you every moment, every second. But now you can see, he's just letting the game come to him.\"\n\nThe Mavs beat top-seeded Oklahoma City in six games before knocking out No. 3 Minnesota in five games in the Western Conference finals, the clincher giving Dallas a five-game road winning streak in the playoffs.\n\n\"I feel like it's a great chapter that's being written right now,\" Irving said. \"I'm enjoying every step of the way. I'm not taking anything for granted. I'm enjoying the hot weather right now. I'm enjoying the Dallas community. We talked about this early in the season, just how much I felt embraced.\"\n\nIrving went on to say it went deeper than that, reminding reporters of an entire career spent in the other conference.\n\n\"Seasonal depression is real when you're growing up in the north,\" Irving said. \"I spent 12 years in the Eastern Conference in three cold cities that deal with four seasons. So you come out here and you're able to get outside and ground yourself a little bit more and spend some time with your family. Watch your kids run outside.\"\n\nIrving and Doncic have at least another season together. Irving has a player option for 2025-26, Doncic for the season after that.\n\nKidd believes a preseason trip to Madrid, where Doncic grew as a teenaged pro in the EuroLeague, helped the two superstars bond.\n\nNow, winning is cementing that bond, one of the most poignant moments for the pair coming in the final seconds of Game 3 against the Timberwolves, after the Mavs knew they had clinched a 3-0 lead.\n\n\"When we were winning by nine on that last possession, I told (Irving), 'I'm tired,' and he told me, 'That's the way it's supposed to be,'\" Doncic said. \"He brought the calmness to the team and to me. He brought the maturity. I'm learning from him every day.\"", "source": {"uri": "virginislandsdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virgin Islands Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While the Mavericks may be wary of the formidable duo of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, the Celtics' Jrue Holiday has expressed great concern about the Mavericks' guard, Kyrie Irving.\n\nDuring a recent press conference, Holiday was asked about his team's strategy to stop Irving. Without hesitation, he responded with one word: \"Pray.\"\n\nThe eight-time All-Star has often left opponents scrambling to devise effective strategies against him on the court. His move to the Mavericks has amplified his potential to disrupt defensive plans with his improved athleticism and seasoned play.\n\nIn this year's two regular-season games against Boston, Kobe Bryant's mentee averaged 21 points and 2.5 assists, shooting 42 percent from the field.\n\nMoreover, Irving averaged 27.0 points, 4.6 assists, and 3.6 rebounds in the five-game series win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nDespite being a dominant force in recent seasons, the Celtics have yet to clinch the championship. Their powerful duo, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, have consistently driven the team to the playoffs but have fallen short of the ultimate prize.\n\nJrue Holiday recognizes that Kyrie Irving is not just a standout player during the regular season or playoffs. He has also proven himself on the grandest stage. Irving's performance with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals demonstrated his ability to elevate his game when it mattered most.\n\nDuring the 2016 NBA Finals, Irving perfectly complemented LeBron James. In Game 5, Irving scored an impressive 41 points, helping to extend the series and keep the Cavaliers' championship hopes alive.\n\nOne of the most unforgettable moments for Irving's fans is his decisive play in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. With just 53 seconds remaining, Irving hit a go-ahead 3-pointer over Stephen Curry. It ultimately sealed the victory for the Cavaliers and secured their place in NBA history.\n\nThroughout the seven games of the 2016 NBA Finals, Irving averaged 27.1 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 3.9 assists.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shabiha_akter@totalprosports.com", "name": "Shabiha Akter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design_20240606_083756_0000-e1717641640955-1024x563.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Recapping his tumultuous history with Boston - The Boston Globe", "body": "RelatedWe know what Boston thinks of Kyrie Irving. But in Dallas, they couldn't be more thrilled with their star.\n\nEven though Irving has largely deflected comments regarding his rocky tenure in Boston -- an approach shared by many of his former Celtics teammates -- it's all but a given Irving will be booed profusely as soon as he steps on the parquet floor for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night.\n\nSo why is Irving held in contempt by Boston sports fans?\n\nLet's run through the timeline of Irving's eventful two years with the Celtics.\n\nAfter the Isaiah Thomas-led Celtics put together a few spirited runs, Danny Ainge orchestrated a blockbuster move to bring in an elite talent in Irving during the 2017 offseason.\n\nBoston dealt away Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic, and Brooklyn's 2018 unprotected first-round pick for Irving, with the skilled guard expected to be the featured piece on a Celtics roster that already featured Al Horford and signed Gordon Hayward in free agency.\n\nAdd in a stacked cast of younger talent in rookie Jayson Tatum, 20-year-old Jaylen Brown, 23-year-old Marcus Smart, and 23-year-old Terry Rozier, and Boston was seemingly set for the long haul with Irving leading the charge.\n\n\"I'm grateful and I can't wait to get on the floor,\" Irving said at his introductory press conference at TD Garden. \"Boston came right at the exact time and it was meant to be that way.\"\n\nIrving and the Celtics put together a successful first season, with Irving averaging 24.4 points per game and Boston finishing second in the Eastern Conference with a 55-27 record.\n\nBy the time the playoffs rolled around, the Celtics had to trudge ahead without Irving (knee surgery) and Hayward (fractured ankle, dislocated ankle).\n\nBut the shorthanded Boston roster reeled off an impressive run, forcing LeBron James and the Cavaliers into a decisive Game 7 in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nBoston's run came to an end, with the Celtics falling to Cleveland, 87-79.\n\nIrving was not in attendance for Game 7, as he was recovering from nasal surgery.\n\n\"Kyrie had a deviated septum, had some surgery on that, and so I don't think he wanted to be seen,\" Ainge noted, adding: \"He's a really good-looking guy. He can't ruin his movie career.\"\n\nThings quickly went downhill for a Celtics team that seemed poised for a breakthrough season in 2018-19.\n\nAll eyes were fixated on a now-healthy Irving entering the 2018-19 season, especially with the skilled scorer entering the last year of his contract.\n\nBut Irving assuaged any fears felt by Celtics fans during an event with season ticket holders at TD Garden, declaring he planned to stay in Boston for the long haul.\n\n\"I shared it with some of my teammates as well as the organization and everyone else in Boston: If you guys will have me back, I plan on re-signing here next year,\" Irving said to a cheering crowd at TD Garden.\n\nThe following day, Irving elaborated on why he pledged a commitment to staying in Boston.\n\n\"I needed just some time to kind of be back in Boston and feel great about different things I wanted to explore in my career,\" Irving said. \"But I think the important thing was just being happy and having an environment where I'm challenged on a physical level as well as mental.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Irving's stint in Boston to sour.\n\nAfter a 105-103 road loss to the Magic on Jan. 14, Irving appeared to vent his frustrations about the Celtics' younger core and their missteps on the court.\n\n\"What's the big picture? What are we doing here?\" Irving said. \"These are things I don't think some of my teammates have faced just every single day. It's not easy to be great.\"\n\nCeltics fans continued to feel uneasy about Irving's future in Boston after a video surfaced of the guard chatting with then-Warriors forward Kevin Durant during the 2019 NBA All-Star Game.\n\nAmid fears that Irving and Durant were planning on teaming up on a team with two max slots to take in both of their new contracts, Irving sparred with reporters over the video.\n\n\"What I do with my life is my business,\" Irving said, per NBC Sports Boston. \"It's none of yours, none of anybody's business.\"\n\nDurant admitted in 2020 that both he and Irving formulated their plan to team up the following offseason during that All-Star Game meet-up.\n\n\"The All-Star game video where they caught us in the hallway. That's when it was solidified that we were going somewhere,\" Durant said during \"The ETC's\" podcast in 2020. \"They didn't know for a fact where it was, but it was somewhere.\"\n\nThe 2018-19 Celtics season came to an end against the Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Irving struggling mightily in the five-game series.\n\nWith one foot potentially out the door when it came to Irving's tenure in Boston, the guard averaged 20.4 points per game against the Bucks -- but shot just 35.6 percent from the field, including 21.9 percent from 3-point range.\n\nIn Boston's season-ending loss in Game 5, Irving shot 6-of-21 from the field with one assist, one rebound, three turnovers and was a minus-25 in a 25-point loss to Milwaukee.\n\nSure enough, Irving went on to leave the Celtics in free agency -- teaming up with Durant and signing a four-year, $141 million with the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nAfter missing his first game back at TD Garden in 2019-20 due to injury, Irving drew headlines for his unique pregame ritual before playing on the parquet floor for the first time as a member of the Nets.\n\nPrior to pregame warmups, Irving was spotted waving sage around the floor at TD Garden.\n\n\"It just comes from a lot of native tribes,\" Irving said after the game, per CBS Sports. \"Being able to sage, just cleanse the energy, make sure that we're all balanced. When we come into this job, we come into this place, it's not anything that I don't do at home that I did today. I saged last game, and I plan to sage almost every game if the opposing team will allow me to.\"\n\nIrving's first playoff series against the Celtics after signing with the Nets had several ugly incidents, with a fan throwing a water bottle at Irving's head after Brooklyn's 141-126 win in Game 4 of their first-round bout.\n\n\"It's been that way in history in terms of entertainers, performers, and sports for a very long time, just underlying racism and treating people like they're in a human zoo,\" Irving said. \"Throwing stuff at people, saying things. There's a certain point where it gets to be too much.\"\n\nJust before avoiding that water bottle, Irving appeared to stomp on the Celtics' logo at midcourt -- dragging his shoe across Lucky the Leprechaun's face before making his way off the court.\n\nThe Celtics took care of business against the Nets in their rematch, sweeping them in four games in an anticipated first-round matchup.\n\nGame 1 of that series saw Celtics fans continually get under Irving's skin, with multiple boos and jeers eventually prompting Irving to toss up the middle finger to the TD Garden crowd. He was later fined $50,000 by the NBA for the gesture.\n\nThat series marked the most recent time that Irving battled the Celtics in the playoffs, with the guard eventually being traded to the Mavericks in February 2023.\n\nMore than a year later, Irving will try to topple the Celtics in the 2024 NBA Finals -- with Banner 18 hanging in the balance.\n\n\"I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that, and I've been able to grow since then,\" Irving said on Monday. \"So of course it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship that I have with the fans.\n\n\"I almost think about 'Gladiator,' just winning the crowd over. It is good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well. They still respect great basketball.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It won't be as cordial for the Mavs guard once Celtics fans pack the Garden for Game 1 on Thursday night.\n\nIrving's return to Boston to battle the Celtics for a championship has been one of the biggest storylines leading up to the NBA Finals. And with over a week of downtime before the two teams square off in Game 1, there was a lot made of Irving's past history with the Celtics.\n\nThere's no need to rehash Irving's departure from Boston and all the incidents that followed, but it got ugly at times. Real ugly. Irving expressed some remorse over all of it earlier this week, likely in a way to get on the good side of Boston fans ahead the series.\n\nBut he's seen both sides of Celtics fans and he knows which side will be out during the NBA Finals. He's promising a much better response than the last time he was at TD Garden for a playoff game.\n\n\"I mean, I've experienced Boston twofold; my first few years being in the NBA playing for the Cavs, then coming here to Boston, then being right down the street in Brooklyn, now being here in the Finals playing against them in a potential four-to-seven-game series,\" Irving said during Wednesday's media day.\n\n\"You just got to breathe through it. To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions, what they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is,\" he continued. \"Don't overthink it. I've been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength.\n\n\"There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball,\" Irving added. \"The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nSo it doesn't sound like there will be any more logo stomping or freedom rocket salutes from Irving, but we'll believe it when we don't see it. Celtics fans are going to do everything they can to get Irving off his game and into his head.\n\nAs for the game itself, the Celtics will be looking to limit both Irving and his backcourt mate, Luka Doncic. It's going to be an arduous task for Boston defenders, but one the Celtics are confident they can handle.\n\nHoliday is one of the best defenders in the game, and he's got plenty of experience to draw on when it comes to keeping Irving in check.\n\n\"I think it's just familiarity. I think knowing each other's game, doing your best to stay in front of him, trying to take away the things that will probably hurt you the most,\" said Holiday, who has racked up six All-Defensive honors throughout his career.\n\nBut keeping Irving and Doncic from going wild on the scoresheet -- or at least trying to -- will not fall on the shoulders of just one player.\n\n\"Probably most [important] of all is having help,\" said Holiday. \"Him being able to see multiple guys on the court, making it look like it's crowded, making shots as tough as possible, even though he's a tough shot-maker.\"\n\n\"They're two of the most talented guards this league has seen. It's going to be a challenge for all of us. It's not going to be one-on-one; we all have to participate,\" said Derrick White. \"It's going to be a lot of fun. Just have to embrace that challenge.\"\n\nWhile the Celtics have to worry about the Doncic-Irving duo, the Mavs will have their hands full with Boston's dynamic duet of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. (Not to mention Holiday, White, and Kristaps Porzingis, all of whom can make a team pay on the offensive end.) Irving was teammates when Tatum and Brown during their first seasons in the league, and is amazed by their growth over the years.\n\n\"I'm excited. They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point,\" Irving said. \"So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/05/e7605038-f638-43d2-aace-d703cfae27a1/thumbnail/1200x630g2/59acf47755e7de46002c3f36cf52142e/kyrie-irving.jpg?v=6d480a252670b63de1e37fef02c977a5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The previous two series were both in the first round, however -- in 2021 and 2022 when Irving was with the Brooklyn Nets -- and now he'll be battling his former team on the NBA Finals stage.\n\nConsidering Irving's tumultuous history in Boston, he'll likely receive a chorus of boos from Celtics fans in Thursday's Game 1. But whereas he returned the crowd's hostility in years past, the 32-year-old suggested he'll be taking a more mindful approach this time around.\n\n\"I've experienced Boston in twofold: my first few years being in the NBA playing for the Cavs, then coming here to Boston, and then being right down the street in Brooklyn, and then now being here in the Finals playing against them, in a potential four-to-seven game series,\" Irving told reporters Wednesday at NBA Finals Media Day at TD Garden, as seen in the video player above.\n\n\"You've just got to breathe through it.

Irving recently expressed remorse for giving the middle finger to Celtics fans during the 2022 playoffs and said Wednesday he'll keep his focus between the lines during the Finals.\n\n\"There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball,\" Irving said. \"The fans are gonna say what they're gonna say. I appreciate them and the relationship they have to the game, but it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nThe Boston backstory aside, Irving could play a crucial role in this series. He averaged 27 points per game in the Western Conference Finals -- including a 36-point effort in Dallas' decisive Game 5 victory -- and is capable of taking the game over offensively if the Celtics devote too much attention to Luka Doncic.\n\nWhether Irving can keep that momentum going against his former team remains to be seen, but at the very least, the player who quit on the Celtics in the 2019 playoffs appears to be long gone.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/06/Kyrie-Irving-GettyImages-2156223182.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Boston uses the incredible versatility of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, two young stars entering their prime.\n\nWho has the edge heading into Game 1? Let's break down the biggest storylines.\n\nThe Celtics (64-18) were arguably the most well-rounded team in the NBA this season. They finished with an offensive rating of 123.2, not only the best in the league but in league history. Boston's defense wasn't shabby either, ending the regular season with a 111.6 rating, third best in the NBA.\n\nTatum has been the catalyst all season for the Celtics, but particularly in the postseason. He leads the team in points (26), rebounds (10.4) and assists (5.9) per game. Brown is just a notch behind him statistically, averaging 25 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.6 assists a game. He earned Eastern Conference Finals MVP following Boston's sweep of the Indiana Pacers after making big play after big play, either as a scorer or facilitator.\n\nThe X factor for this series could be guard Jrue Holiday, a veteran acquired last offseason in a trade with the Portland Trail Blazers. Boston gave up a lot to get him -- Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams and two first-round picks -- but he's been worth it.\n\nHoliday, who won an NBA title with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2021, is averaging 12.7 points and 4.6 assists in the playoffs while playing his typical lockdown defense. How Holiday guards Irving could determine whether the Celtics claim the NBA championship for a league-leading 18th time.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nThe Mavericks' 32-year-old point guard didn't have the best time in a Celtics uniform, to say the least. In fact, he's known as one of the biggest villains of Boston's fan base. Irving played two seasons in Boston, from 2017-2019, averaging 24.1 points and 6.1 assists a game, and led the franchise to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2018.\n\nHowever the following season he struggled mightily in the 2019 playoffs, most notably in the Eastern Conference semifinals against Milwaukee. Irving shot a dreadful 37 for 104 from the field and 7 for 32 from 3-point range as the Celtics were eliminated in five games.\n\nHe wasn't much better off the court.\n\nIrving told fans at a season-ticket holder event ahead of the 2018-19 season that he planned on re-signing with the franchise. The next February, when asked if he was set to return to Boston, he famously said, \"I don't owe anybody s---.\" After the season he left to join Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nThis will be Irving's third playoff series since leaving Boston.\n\nHe told members of the media this week after practice that he is a changed man.\n\n\"I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that, and I've been able to grow since then,\" he said. \"So of course it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship that I have with the fans. I almost think about 'Gladiator,' just winning the crowd over. It is good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well. They still respect great basketball.\"\n\nAnd great basketball is exactly what Irving is playing.\n\nIrving averaged 25.6 points, 5.2 assists and 5 rebounds per game for the Mavericks (50-42) during the regular season, but he has stepped up his production in the playoffs. In the Western Conference Finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves, he poured in 27 points a night on 49 percent shooting from the field. This includes a 36-point performance on 14-of-27 shooting in Game 5 that sent Dallas to the NBA Finals.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, who along with Irving brought a championship back to Cleveland in 2016, said the guard is unlike any teammate he's had in his career.\n\n\"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card,\" James said on his \"Mind The Game\" podcast this week. \"That's like having a 'draw four' in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno.\"\n\nIrving complemented James earlier in his career. Now he has Doncic.\n\nSince entering the league in 2018, Doncic has been utterly dominant offensively. The 25-year-old led the NBA in scoring (33.9 points per game this season) and was second in assists (9.8). Like Irving, Doncic has continued his tear in the postseason. He sliced through Minnesota in the Western Conference Finals with an array of moves and shooting from every spot on the floor, averaging 32.4 points a game in the series.\n\nFormer NBA coach and broadcaster Stan Van Gundy publicly called Irving and Doncic the \"best offensive backcourt in the history of the NBA.\"\n\nHe might just be right.\n\nPorzingis, who spent three seasons in Dallas, from 2019-2022, is expected to return from a calf injury just in time to face his former team. The 7-foot Celtics center has not appeared in a game since April 29 in Boston's opening-round series against the Miami Heat.\n\nWhile Porzingis' services haven't truly been needed -- the Celtics went 9-1 in his absence -- he will add another dynamic piece to pair with Brown and Tatum. Porzingis is a great finisher around the rim and despite his size can hit shots from both midrange and beyond the arc.\n\nHe's also expected to bolster Boston's defense by blocking or altering shots. Porzingis swatted nearly two attempts a game this season.\n\n\"He does a great job of just making things difficult,\" Celtics guard Derrick White said at practice this week. \"It's always nice to know that he's back there, whether he blocks or he doesn't block. He makes them think about it. That's been really great having him on our side, just doing the things he did day in and day out. Once he comes back and gets in the flow, I think it's going to be nice.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His decision to join the the Nets in 2019 was met with celebration, but four years later, his mere presence gave the Nets franchise consternation. During the 2022-23 season, the Nets reached its last straw with Irving following a controversial tweet, and the veteran guard eventually asked for a trade. It was the Dallas Mavericks that swooped him and acquired him, but it did not come without its fair share of risks.\n\nHowever, the Mavericks' decision to take a chance on Irving has paid off in a big way just a year later. The Mavs are four wins away from hoisting the Larry O'Brien trophy for the second time in franchise history, thanks in large part to Irving. As a famous general manager once said, \"scared money don't make none\" and the Mavs are certainly thankful that they took a leap of faith in bringing Irving in, with franchise president Nico Harrison banking on his relationship with Irving to serve as a catalyst for the talented guard's much-needed blank slate.\n\n\"Honestly, (the confidence) was just the fact that I know Kyrie. I know his character, and I know how talented he is,\" Harrison said, per Sam Amick of The Athletic.\n\nIt wasn't like the Mavericks had to break the bank to bring Kyrie Irving on board. The Mavs traded Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, an unprotected 2029 first-round pick (as well as two second-rounders) to the Nets in exchange for Irving and Markieff Morris; it's safe to say that Dinwiddie and Finney-Smith, while important pieces during the Mavs' run to the Conference Finals in 2022, don't even come close to the talent that is Irving.\n\nThus, given Harrison's familiarity with Irving during their days working together with Nike, the Mavericks saw a golden opportunity to buy low. Even in free agency, the Mavs were able to sign Irving to a less expensive contract than what it took for the Houston Rockets to bring Fred VanVleet in.\n\n\"You can't just get talent like (Irving). It's not out there. Think of how many guys in the league who are available that are that talented. It just doesn't happen. So we were fortunate that Kyrie became available. For me, I didn't listen to the outside noise because I have my own relationship with him,\" Harrison added.\n\nThrough Kyrie Irving's one and a half-year stint thus far with the Mavericks, he has been a model professional whom his teammates have looked up to. Irving has emerged as the team's vocal leader, as well as an assassin the team can get behind in the clutch. Even the Mavs would say that the trade worked out better than they had envisioned, especially given how deep in the gutter nearly everyone's perception of Irving was at the time.\n\nThe Mavericks took a big risk in bringing Kyrie Irving in after a tumultuous stint with the Nets\n\n2021 was when disaster began for Kyrie Irving in a Nets uniform. Irving sustained an injury that kept him out of the Nets' second-round defeat at the hands of the Milwaukee Bucks, and from there, it only went downhill. Prior to the start of the 2021-22 season, the city of New York required athletes playing for a team based in the city to take the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIrving decided not to take the vaccine, and as a result, the Nets franchise decided not to play him altogether at the start of the season even though he could have suited up for the team on the road in cities not requiring vaccination. When the Nets were faltering in the middle of the season, that was when they brought Irving back to play road games, and later on, the city lifted vaccination restrictions, paving the way for Irving to suit up for home games as well.\n\nThat was when the relationship between Kyrie Irving and the Nets franchise began to crumble completely. His controversial tweet in 2022 led to an indefinite suspension, further fracturing the relationship between the two parties. So even though the Nets recovered upon Irving's return, even going on a 12-game winning streak from December 7, 2022 to January 2, 2023, the talented but polarizing guard requested a trade not too long after.\n\nAt first, it looked like the trade was going to be a disaster, what with their struggles following the 2023 trade deadline that led to their decision to tank their final few games just so they could keep their lottery pick. They then proceeded to build a group of hard-nosed defenders and competitors around Irving and Luka Doncic, and they went all-in on their core with their trades for PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford back in February.\n\nBut without the Mavericks doing nothing but provide a safe haven for Irving to be his unabashed self, they won't be able to reach this point. Welcomed and beloved with open arms, the 32-year old guard has elevated the Luka Doncic-led team and has helped them to within four wins away from a championship in return. And it all started with the Mavs' decision to block out the noise and accept Irving for who he is.\n\n\"I think we had to look past the noise. Like, we're talking about Kai the basketball player. The noise is the noise. It could be good noise, bad noise, but you just have to look at what you feel fits on the floor. And that's all I think we looked at,\" Kidd said.\n\nMinority owner Mark Cuban, who was still the Mavericks' majority stakeholder at the time of the Kyrie Irving trade, echoed the same sentiment.\n\n\"You know, in this business -- and every business, really -- you've got to just block out all the social media experts and just go with who you are. Yeah, (the noise around Irving) was different. But that's the easiest stuff to block out. When they talk about someone's personality, or this and that, and then you see Kai and how he interacts with players from around the league, everybody loved him.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Dinwiddie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Dinwiddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_Finney-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dorian Finney-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022\u201323_Oklahoma_City_Thunder_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022\u201323 Oklahoma City Thunder season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u201322_Oklahoma_City_Thunder_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021\u201322 Oklahoma City Thunder season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_VanVleet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred VanVleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markieff_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Markieff Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Cuban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Why-Mavericks-took-risk-on-Kyrie-Irving-trade-despite-controversies.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

According to Brian Windhorst who spoke on ESPN's Get Up, the relationship between the two stars soured significantly after Irving requested a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers, which led to his departure from the team and the end of a highly successful partnership with James.\n\n\"When Kyrie left Cleveland they pretty much didn't talk for years they were at odds at some point in the last few years. They've made up to the point where LeBron actively wanted the Lakers to trade for Kyrie Irvingwhen he was on the trade block a couple of different times, like 22, 23. \"\n\n\"The Lakers made an offer at the trade deadline last year. Dallas's offer was just better. They had better players to trade and potentially more valuable picks. The Lakers were trying to protect them. Then last summer, Kyrie actively wanted LeBron to come to Dallas. LeBron wanted Kyrie to come to the Lakers.\"\n\n\"Now, LeBron going to Dallas, he's under contract, that's not feasible. It was relayed to me that Kyrie wanted LeBron in Dallas, I went and checked on it and basically the LeBron side said, we'd love to play with Kyrie in LA.\"\n\n\"The Lakers actually could have created the cap space to beat the Mavericks offer last year, but they elected not to. They elected to re-sign the players from the team that had just gotten to the Western Conference Finals Finals.\"\n\n\"So there's a couple of near misses. I do not suspect that we are going to see an opportunity for them to play again. But I would never say never in the NBA.\" (0:39)\n\nDuring a recent episode of the Mind the Game podcast, LeBron James praised Irving as \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen\" and expressed his frustration that they are no longer teammates. This admiration contrasts sharply with their past, as Windhorst revealed that the two did not communicate for several years after Irving's exit.\n\nThe reconciliation between James and Irving became evident when James advocated for the Los Angeles Lakers to acquire Irving on multiple occasions. Most notably, during the 2023 trade deadline, the Lakers made an offer for Irving, but the Dallas Mavericks' offer was more attractive, leading to Irving's move to Dallas.\n\nDespite a challenging start with the Mavericks, Irving found his rhythm and played a crucial role in leading the team to the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Lakers had another opportunity to sign Irving during the offseason when he was a free agent. However, they chose not to pursue him aggressively, deciding instead to re-sign their existing players who had helped them reach the Western Conference Finals. This decision ultimately led Irving to re-sign with the Mavericks.\n\nWhile it appears unlikely that James and Irving will play together again, Windhorst suggested that in the unpredictable world of the NBA, one should never say never.

Boston uses the incredible versatility of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, two young stars entering their prime.\n\nWho has the edge heading into Game 1? Let's break down the biggest storylines.\n\nThe Celtics (64-18) were arguably the most well-rounded team in the NBA this season. They finished with an offensive rating of 123.2, not only the best in the league but in league history. Boston's defense wasn't shabby either, ending the regular season with a 111.6 rating, third best in the NBA.\n\nTatum has been the catalyst all season for the Celtics, but particularly in the postseason. He leads the team in points (26), rebounds (10.4) and assists (5.9) per game. Brown is just a notch behind him statistically, averaging 25 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.6 assists a game. He earned Eastern Conference Finals MVP following Boston's sweep of the Indiana Pacers after making big play after big play, either as a scorer or facilitator.\n\nThe X factor for this series could be guard Jrue Holiday, a veteran acquired last offseason in a trade with the Portland Trail Blazers. Boston gave up a lot to get him -- Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams and two first-round picks -- but he's been worth it.\n\nHoliday, who won an NBA title with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2021, is averaging 12.7 points and 4.6 assists in the playoffs while playing his typical lockdown defense. How Holiday guards Irving could determine whether the Celtics claim the NBA championship for a league-leading 18th time.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nThe Mavericks' 32-year-old point guard didn't have the best time in a Celtics uniform, to say the least. In fact, he's known as one of the biggest villains of Boston's fan base. Irving played two seasons in Boston, from 2017-2019, averaging 24.1 points and 6.1 assists a game, and led the franchise to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2018.\n\nHowever the following season he struggled mightily in the 2019 playoffs, most notably in the Eastern Conference semifinals against Milwaukee. Irving shot a dreadful 37 for 104 from the field and 7 for 32 from 3-point range as the Celtics were eliminated in five games.\n\nHe wasn't much better off the court.\n\nIrving told fans at a season-ticket holder event ahead of the 2018-19 season that he planned on re-signing with the franchise. The next February, when asked if he was set to return to Boston, he famously said, \"I don't owe anybody s---.\" After the season he left to join Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nThis will be Irving's third playoff series since leaving Boston.\n\nHe told members of the media this week after practice that he is a changed man.\n\n\"I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that, and I've been able to grow since then,\" he said. \"So of course it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship that I have with the fans. I almost think about 'Gladiator,' just winning the crowd over. It is good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well. They still respect great basketball.\"\n\nAnd great basketball is exactly what Irving is playing.\n\nIrving averaged 25.6 points, 5.2 assists and 5 rebounds per game for the Mavericks (50-42) during the regular season, but he has stepped up his production in the playoffs. In the Western Conference Finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves, he poured in 27 points a night on 49 percent shooting from the field. This includes a 36-point performance on 14-of-27 shooting in Game 5 that sent Dallas to the NBA Finals.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, who along with Irving brought a championship back to Cleveland in 2016, said the guard is unlike any teammate he's had in his career.\n\n\"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card,\" James said on his \"Mind The Game\" podcast this week. \"That's like having a 'draw four' in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno.\"\n\nIrving complemented James earlier in his career. Now he has Doncic.\n\nSince entering the league in 2018, Doncic has been utterly dominant offensively. The 25-year-old led the NBA in scoring (33.9 points per game this season) and was second in assists (9.8). Like Irving, Doncic has continued his tear in the postseason. He sliced through Minnesota in the Western Conference Finals with an array of moves and shooting from every spot on the floor, averaging 32.4 points a game in the series.\n\nFormer NBA coach and broadcaster Stan Van Gundy publicly called Irving and Doncic the \"best offensive backcourt in the history of the NBA.\"\n\nHe might just be right.\n\nPorzingis, who spent three seasons in Dallas, from 2019-2022, is expected to return from a calf injury just in time to face his former team. The 7-foot Celtics center has not appeared in a game since April 29 in Boston's opening-round series against the Miami Heat.\n\nWhile Porzingis' services haven't truly been needed -- the Celtics went 9-1 in his absence -- he will add another dynamic piece to pair with Brown and Tatum. Porzingis is a great finisher around the rim and despite his size can hit shots from both midrange and beyond the arc.\n\nHe's also expected to bolster Boston's defense by blocking or altering shots. Porzingis swatted nearly two attempts a game this season.\n\n\"He does a great job of just making things difficult,\" Celtics guard Derrick White said at practice this week. \"It's always nice to know that he's back there, whether he blocks or he doesn't block. He makes them think about it. That's been really great having him on our side, just doing the things he did day in and day out. Once he comes back and gets in the flow, I think it's going to be nice.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Like there was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do.\"\n\n\"And sitting here watching it, you know, I'm like, I'm playing like so f***ing happy and so proud and to watch him and continue his growth and whatever the case may be. And at the same time, I'm so f***ing mad at the same time that I am not his running mate anymore. So I'm like, I just remember those times.\" (0:55)\n\nReflecting on their time together, LeBron called Kyrie a \"wizard\" on the basketball court, highlighting Irving's unparalleled skill and versatility. Despite his pride in seeing Irving's growth and continued success, LeBron admitted feeling a mix of happiness and anger, wishing he could still be Kyrie's running mate.\n\nLeBron and Kyrie played together for three years with the Cleveland Cavaliers, during which they made three consecutive NBA Finals appearances and won a championship in 2016. Their partnership was one of the most dynamic duos in NBA history, combining LeBron's all-around greatness with Kyrie's scoring prowess and clutch performances.\n\nLeBron's comments could be seen as a message to the Lakers, who had the opportunity to sign Kyrie Irving this offseason. LeBron reportedly pushed for the Lakers to acquire Irving, but the team was hesitant to offer Kyrie a four-year deal. Instead, the Lakers opted to retain Austin Reaves and Max Christie, prioritizing their young talent and future flexibility over reuniting LeBron with his former teammate.\n\nIrving has been exceptional during the playoffs, leading the Dallas Mavericks to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011. His postseason performance has been outstanding, averaging 22.8 points, 5.2 assists, and 3.9 rebounds. Irving's ability to rise to the occasion in critical moments has been a key factor in the Mavericks' success.\n\nAs Irving prepares to face the Boston Celtics in the Finals, LeBron can't help but wonder what might have been if they were still teammates. The duo's history of success together and their complementary playing styles make it easy to imagine the Lakers making a deeper playoff run with Irving in the lineup.\n\nLeBron's wistful comments underscore the deep respect and admiration he has for Kyrie, as well as the lingering \"what if\" scenario of what they could achieve together in today's NBA.\n\nWhile LeBron focuses on his own journey with the Lakers, it's clear that the bond and on-court chemistry he shared with Kyrie remains a significant and cherished part of his career. As fans watch Irving's Finals performance, they'll also be reminded of the special connection between these two basketball greats.\n\nThe Lakers Would Be In The NBA Finals If They Had Kyrie Irving\n\nThe Lakers would be in the NBA Finals this year if they had Kyrie Irving. While Austin Reaves has been a great player for the Lakers, he doesn't possess the same shot-making ability and playoff experience as Irving. A trio of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Kyrie Irving would be formidable and likely dominant in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Lakers were knocked out in the first round against the Denver Nuggets in five games. Two of these games were decided by two points, both of which went against the Lakers. In those tight moments, Irving's ability to create his own shot and perform under pressure could have been the difference maker.\n\nIn the playoffs, teams need players who can generate their own offense at any given moment. LeBron and Davis were excellent, but neither has the same shot-creating prowess as Irving. Kyrie's skill set, which includes an elite handle, the ability to hit difficult shots, and a knack for performing in clutch situations, would have added a critical dimension to the Lakers' offense.\n\nD'Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves provided solid guard play throughout the season, but Irving's impact would have been on another level. Russell had his share of inconsistent performances, which hurt the Lakers at crucial times. Irving's consistency and ability to take over games would have given the Lakers a more reliable third option behind LeBron and Davis.\n\nIrving's playoff experience is another invaluable asset. He has been to the NBA Finals multiple times and has performed exceptionally well under the bright lights. His presence would have alleviated some of the pressure on LeBron and Davis, allowing them to play more freely and effectively.\n\nThe Lakers' decision not to acquire Irving might have been influenced by concerns over his contract demands or off-court issues. However, from a purely basketball standpoint, his addition would have significantly increased their chances of making a deep playoff run. With Irving, the Lakers would have had the firepower and versatility needed to overcome the Nuggets and potentially other tough opponents on their way to the NBA Finals.\n\nRelated: LeBron James Calls Kyrie Irving The Most Gifted Player In NBA History\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Don't overthink it.\n\n\"Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength.\"\n\nThe Celtics swept the Mavericks during the regular season, and some Boston fans will be more than ready to zero in on Irving as a target for heckling.\n\nIrving said he will carry a fearless approach into TD Garden for Game 1 Thursday night, regardless of what is said to him.\n\n\"There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball,\" Irving said. \"The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nIrving played a key role on the LeBron James-led Cavaliers who won a title in 2016 and eliminated the Celtics in seven games in the 2018 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nHe said being back in the NBA Finals eight years later is a reminder of how fleeting such opportunities can be.\n\n\"When you ascend to this level, you put in a lot of hard work, you beat some of the best in the world,\" Irving said. \"Competing with some of the best in the world, I looked at it as, oh I'm going to be here every single year.\"\n\n\"At this age I've been through what I've been through, been able to come out on the other side. I look at it as an opportunity that I don't want to take for granted. I want it to last as long as possible emotionally just because of how much it took to get here.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Mind the Game\", a podcast that he co-hosts with JJ Redick, James said he considers Irving to be \"the most gifted player the NBA\" has ever seen and that he missed having him as a teammate.\n\nIrving said the feeling was mutual, and that he looks to draw upon his past experiences with James to help him during this series.\n\n\"I definitely think about those times,\" Irving said. \"Now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect but also now I'm at this stage, able to use some of the formulas that I was taught from him, some of the great teachers that have come before me.\n\n\"I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game.\"\n\nSmith was picked No. 3 overall in 2022 and was a second-team all-rookie selection in 2023. He asked Tatum what he would say to a young player who isn't quite living up to the lofty expectations set for him.\n\nTatum said he had been there before, told Smith to keep working hard and enjoy his career, and then laughed at himself for sounding like an old person.\n\n\"In the sense of your career, I would say, man, enjoy it. There's going to be some great times,\" Tatum said. There's going to be some times that aren't so great. It's okay to be upset because that means you care, right? You want to be great. People believe that you can. They just try to rush the process.\n\n\"It takes however long it takes. But as long as you work hard, you believe, you got the right support system. Obviously, you do down in Houston. I know all those guys, coaches. Everything will take care of itself, how it's supposed to.\"\n\nKristaps Porzingis, who is expected to return to the Celtics lineup for Game 1 Thursday night, said he can't wait to get back on the floor.\n\n\"It's going to be goose bumps, for sure,\" Porzingis said. \"Especially not playing for a while, then coming back in this kind of environment. It's going to be special. Going to be goose bumps, for sure.

The Brooklyn Nets decided to pass.\n\nHighlights Mavericks success and run to the 2024 NBA Finals stems from Kyrie Irving co-starring with Luka Don\u010di\u0107. The Mavericks made key acquisitions surrounding Irving before a successful run to the NBA Finals after initially adding Irving via trade in 2023. The Lakers missed on Irving with an offer that included Russell Westbrook and two first-round picks, leaving fans wondering about a superteam that never was.\n\nKyrie Irving has done wonders for the state of the Dallas Mavericks. When the team traded for him before last season's NBA trade deadline, it did not immediately yield the results they desired. The team dropped from a playoff spot to the outside of the dance altogether, missing out on the postseason.\n\nThis one just required some time and patience to really pay dividens. The Mavericks spent the offseason building up the team around him and superstar Luka Don\u010di\u0107. They then doubled down and acquired even more help before this year's trade deadline when they traded for Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington.\n\nNow, the team is on their way to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011 after surviving a tough journey through the Western Conference during the NBA Playoffs. The Mavericks can certainly look back and feel like they have won this trade by a metric mile.\n\nThere is no doubt in anyone's mind that Dallas would be nowhere near the finals without Irving lifting them up as Luka's co-star. He executed his role flawlessly beside the Slovenian superstar.\n\nOne team that is likely watching this, wondering what could have been, is the Los Angeles Lakers. At the 2023 trade deadline, the Lakers were in on the sweepstakes to acquire Irving, just like the Mavericks. Thanks to ESPN Reporter Dave McMenamin, the world now knows what the Lakers' offer was.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets decided to pass, accepting the offer from the Mavericks instead, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nNBA Big Three That Never Was There is an alternate universe with a Lakers superteam\n\nThere could be another timeline where the star talents of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Irving came together on the Lakers to form the NBA's newest big three. Look away, Lakers fans, because this could have worked.\n\nEveryone knows the history of James and Irving playing together for the Cleveland Cavaliers. The pair won a ring together back in 2016, erasing the 3-1 lead held by the Golden State Warriors, with one of the best displays in a Finals series from a duo one will ever see.\n\nLeBron and Kyrie: 2016 Finals Stats\n\nCategory\n\nJames\n\nIrving\n\nPPG\n\n29.7\n\n27.1\n\nRPG\n\n11.3\n\n3.9\n\nAPG\n\n8.9\n\n3.9\n\nFG%\n\n49.4\n\n46.8\n\n3P%\n\n37.1\n\n40.5\n\nThat pairing was a proven, championship-caliber commodity. As was the partnership between Davis and James. Theoretically, there is no reason to believe the trio would not have made it work. Before Don\u010di\u0107, James felt like the only running mate where Irving was truly at his best.\n\nJames, Davis, and Irving all have complementary skill sets to each other. The work it would have taken to blend these stars' games together would likely have been minimal. The Lakers may have suffered at first, similarly to the Mavericks, due to the lack of depth on the roster. However, given an offseason to load up the roster with quality role players, they might have been able to, similarly, piece it all together.\n\nTruly, this must be an agonizing thought experiment for Lakers fans, management, and players alike.\n\nStats are courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nRelated 3 Ideal Offseason Moves for the LA Lakers The 2024 NBA Offseason gives the Los Angeles Lakers an opportunity to increase their chances of winning a championship with LeBron James in tow.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(Miami_Heat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Three (Miami Heat)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Reference", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Reference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untitled-11.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Redick, James was full of praise for Irving, who he dubbed \"The Wizard.\"\n\n\"There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do,\" he explained.\n\n\"And sitting here watching [The Playoffs], I'm playing like so f*****g happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth and whatever the case may be.\n\n\"And at the same time, I'm so f*****g mad at the same time that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nJames described Irving as \"the ultimate wild card,\" saying having him on your team was \"like having a Draw Four in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno.\"\n\nHe went on to add that watching Irving's performance in Game 1 of their Western Conference Finals win against the Minnesota Timberwolves was especially eye-opening.\n\nJames explained that watching Irving's play made him realize, \"Oh s**t! Dallas may be able to not only win the Western Conference Finals, they may be able to win the whole thing because of that wild card.\"\n\nIf this wasn't high enough praise, he went so far as to label Irving \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nAs for Redick, he went on to reiterate a comment he'd previously made on-air, saying, \"I think I mean this - I'm not sure there's ever been a player that's more aesthetically pleasing when he has got it going.\n\n\"His game is beautiful.\"\n\nJames' praise quickly drew a variety of comments from fans on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Omg we need Bron and Kyrie to team up in LA ASAP,\" one commented.\n\n\"When Kyrie's on it's like watching [Lionel] Messi play,\" said a second.\n\n\"LeBron to the Mavs confirmed,\" predicted another.\n\nJames has one more optional year on his two-year $99 million contract with the Lakers\n\nHis future has been a hot topic since the end of the Lakers' Playoff run, with James' agent Rich Paul recently hinting that his client's future could lie elsewhere.\n\n\"LeBron is a free agent,\" he said on TNT.\n\nIrving is in the first year of his three-year deal with the Mavericks, worth $120 million.\n\nThe eight-time All-Star will have another chance to show prove James' praise right when the NBA Finals begin on Thursday at 8:30pm ET.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_wood@the-sun.com", "name": "Anthony Wood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/ES_JAMES-IRVING_OFFPLAT.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

His life lessons transcended basketball, any sport, or entertainment business.\"\n\nIrving, 32, spoke about how he was able learn from the example Bryant set, on and off the basketball court, and helped him grow as a person.\n\nIrving was drafted into the NBA in 2011 and Bryant retired in 2016, with the pair facing against one another on six occasions.\n\nHe added that while Bryant is gone, the former Los Angeles Lakers legend \"walks with me in spirit\" every day.\n\n\"I feel his presence every day and I'm just grateful that I got a chance to get to know somebody like that, and I got a chance to challenge somebody like that to one-on-one and to just to pick his brain and just understand that there are bigger things than just the game of basketball, like women empowerment and also doing the little things that a lot of people don't see, meaning helping the world selflessly,\" the Mavs guard said.\n\n\"So I could go on and on about this, but he helped out a lot of people that no one really knows about and he did things without anyone's praise, so I try to follow in that same lineage and create my own path and create my own formula to success while also commemorating his formula that he gave me.\"\n\nIrving has helped lead the Mavericks to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011 and for the third time in the organization's history.\n\nIn Bryant's illustrious career, he went to the NBA Finals on seven occasions, winning the NBA championship five times.\n\nHis backcourt pairing with Luka Don\u010di\u0107 has proved almost unstoppable throughout the playoffs for opposing defenses, but the team faces a tough task against the Boston Celtics, who have themselves romped through the postseason, for the Larry O'Brien trophy.\n\nGame 1 of the NBA Finals begins at 8:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, June 6, in Boston's TD Garden.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

The Mavericks have gotten to this point by defeating three separate 50-plus win teams in their side of the Western Conference postseason bracket, and Irving turned his scoring up quite a bit in the Western Conference Finals to help overcome the Minnesota Timberwolves, who had the best defense in the NBA this year.\n\nThis year, the stories revolving around Irving have focused more on his basketball prowess and less on some of the bizarre rumors swirling about his life off of the court, which has been refreshing, since Irving is one of the most entertaining players to watch in the history of the sport.\n\nIn fact, recently, sports media personality Skip Bayless of FS1 heaped some lofty praise in Irving's direction on a recent episode of Undisputed.\n\n\"Inch for inch, Kyrie is the most gifted player I've ever seen,\" said Bayless, via UNDISPUTED on X, the social media platform formerly referred to as Twitter. \"If we just go up to six feet, two inches tall, because he's more gifted that (Allen Iverson) was, and I loved AI. And AI could leap out of the gym in ways Kyrie can't, but Kyrie has a handle that even AI did not have to me. And it's close, but listen, Kyrie's handle is a spectacular, off the charts, never seen before handle... this is magical handles... and then we get to shot making, shot creation. I've never seen anything like Kyrie. Again, at 6'2'', just creating the shot, figuring it out on the fly, where if that doesn't work, I'll go over here and I'll make this work.\"\n\nIndeed, Irving is one of the most mesmerizing players to watch with the basketball in his hands, as he often improvises moves on a dime that most players would have to take years of practice to master.\n\nCan the Mavericks pull the upset?\n\nThe Celtics are expected by most pundits to defeat the Mavericks in these NBA Finals largely because they project to have five out of the best seven players on the floor going into the series and essentially start a diet All-Star team. There is also the fact that Irving's most recent postseason showing against the Celtics back in 2022 as a member of the Brooklyn Nets was one of the worst of his career.\n\nHowever, the Irving we've seen this year and Dallas almost seems to be a completely different person than we've seen during his previous stops with other organizations, albeit with the same mind-numbing skill and scoring ability. With a championship this year, Irving would go down as one of the, if not the greatest number two option in NBA history due to having done it with two different co-stars (Luka Doncic and LeBron James).\n\nIn any case, Game 1 is set for Thursday evening at 8:30 PM ET.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Bayless", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Skip Bayless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Iverson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allen Iverson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/54bba09e-2379-11ef-871e-76a2217e7cb7.avif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He plays both sides of the ball when he has to but his offensive skill set is pretty special.\"\n\nDoncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.8 assists and 9.2 rebounds a game this season and even after his deep NBA run said he hopes to play for Slovenian in upcoming Paris Olympic qualifying.\n\n\"We'll see how my knee is, but if it's good, I'm going to go play,\" Doncic said.\n\nStill just 25, Doncic is one step from the crown he has dreamed of grabbing.\n\n\"Amazing. First time in the NBA Finals. Hopefully not the last,\" he said. \"Never take it for granted. You never know if you're going to come back so just enjoy the experience.\"\n\nIt's much the same lesson stressed by Irving, who won an NBA title with LeBron James with Cleveland in 2016.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing, the way he connects us,\" Doncic said of Irving. \"He's the one who has been to the finals, who has won the finals, so he's really leading it right now. He's keeping us all together and motivated.\"\n\nEight seasons and three teams later, Irving has been through anti-Semitic and anti-vaccine controversies and backed controversial conspiracy theories but set aside talk to focus on basketball with great success.\n\n\"Some things he has done special in practice, it's insane,\" Doncic said. \"I never seen nobody make those shots. I never seen nobody try those shots. Just some shots are crazy. It's amazing to just experience it.\"\n\nJames, a four-time NBA Most Valuable Player, said on a podcast Tuesday that Irving was \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen\" and wished he was still playing alongside him -- praise that meant much to Irving on Wednesday.\n\n\"I have a great reaction. It's appreciated. There's obviously a lot of gratitude there as well,\" said Irving. \"I'm in a different position, a different place in my life. So is he. We've both been able to mature and really appreciate what we accomplished.\n\n\"There were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man and be comfortable in it... our relationship is different. Definitely miss him.\n\n\"Now I'm able to use some of the formulas I was taught by him. I'm built for this moment because of some of the things I've gone through in my past.\n\n\"Never regretful on how I treated it but a little disappointed how I approached that success.\n\n\"Basketball has been a great teacher for me but life has been a better one.\"\n\n- 'No fear out here' -\n\nIrving has helped teammates channel the tough crowd Boston will present into support.\n\n\"You've just got to breathe through it and realize it's not as hostile as you think it is,\" he said. \"Some of that is anxiety. Some of that is nervousness. It can all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here. It's basketball.\"\n\nDallas forward P.J. Washington says Irving has relaxed the Mavs as they enter unfamiliar territory.\n\n\"Ky, he's done a great job of keeping us cool, calm and collected,\" Washington said. \"Just telling us to feel every emotion, come out and be ourselves.\"\n\nMavs center Daniel Gafford agreed, adding: \"Kyrie is one of the best human beings to be around. He embraces everything he has been through and found ways to improve. It takes a lot of humility to go through something like that.\"\n\njs/bb\n\nMore from this section\n\nCEOs got hefty pay raises in 2023, widening the gap with the workers they oversee\n\nIntroducing

When Irving played in Boston and Brooklyn, he had some heavy criticisms from Celtics fans.\n\nThree years later, he's returning to Boston as a member of the Dallas Mavericks to face his former team in the NBA Finals and the fans he once called out for their \"subtle racism\" towards him and his teammates.\n\nIrving spent two years playing for the Boston Celtics before leaving to join Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets in 2019.\n\nThe next year, Irving and the Nets met the Celtics in the NBA Playoffs where they took a convincing 2-0 lead in the 7-game series. Before the series headed to Boston, Irving expressed to the media that he hoped his return to Boston wasn't tainted by fans being racist.\n\n\"Hopefully we can just keep it strictly basketball,\" Irving said during the post-game press conference. \"There's no belligerence or racism going on, subtle racism, and people yelling [expletive] from the crowd. Even if it is, it's part of the nature of the game and we're just going to focus on what we can control.\"\n\nKyrie added about his claims of racism in Boston: \"I'm not the only one who could attest to this . . . but it's just, it is what it is. The whole world knows it.\"\n\nDuring the next two games in Boston, Kyrie had multiple interactions with angry Celtics fans, including a fan being arrested for throwing a water bottle at him after Brooklyn's Game 4 win.\n\nBut it didn't stop there.\n\nIn 2022, Irving was fined $50,000 for flashing his middle finger at Boston fans during the Nets' Game 1 playoff loss in 2022, according to ESPN.\n\nNow, Irving, who seems to be happy and thriving in his new environment said he had regrets about past interactions with Boston fans and is in a better place emotionally.\n\n\"I think I'm better at consolidating kind of the emotions now or being aware of what it's going to be like,\" Irving told ESPN after the Mavericks' Monday practice. \"We call it animosity, we call it hate, we call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.' I mean, there are real, live circumstances going on in the world that are bigger than the basketball, kind of the competitive side of things and answering those questions.\"\n\nHe continued, \"But I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s -- a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level. It wasn't a great reflection on my end towards the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment, no matter what people are yelling at you.\"\n\nIrving also acknowledged his growth as a human since his short tenure in Boston and says he looks forward to the challenge.\n\n\"I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that, and I've been able to grow since then. So of course it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship that I have with the fans. I almost think about 'Gladiator,' just winning the crowd over. It is good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well. They still respect great basketball.\"\n\n2024 NBA Finals Feature 2 Black Head Coaches For Just 3rd Time, Technically\n\nExploring The History Of The NBA's Lack Of Black Ownership\n\nNotable NBA Players Who Attended HBCUs 24 photos\n\nRELATED TAGS\n\nBoston Celtics Kyrie Irving NBA", "source": {"uri": "newsone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News One"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bilal_morris@newsone.com", "name": "Bilal Morris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_finger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The finger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historically black colleges and universities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://newsone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2024/06/17175929293546.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=560&crop=0,0,100,320px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man and be comfortable in it... our relationship is different. Definitely miss him.\n\n\"Now I'm able to use some of the formulas I was taught by him. I'm built for this moment because of some of the things I've gone through in my past.\n\n\"Never regretful on how I treated it but a little disappointed how I approached that success.\n\n\"Basketball has been a great teacher for me but life has been a better one.\"\n\nIrving has helped teammates channel the tough crowd Boston will present into support.\n\n\"You've just got to breathe through it and realize it's not as hostile as you think it is,\" he said. \"Some of that is anxiety. Some of that is nervousness. It can all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here. It's basketball.\"\n\nDallas forward P.J. Washington says Irving has relaxed the Mavs as they enter unfamiliar territory.\n\n\"Ky, he's done a great job of keeping us cool, calm and collected,\" Washington said. \"Just telling us to feel every emotion, come out and be ourselves.\"\n\nMavs center Daniel Gafford agreed, adding: \"Kyrie is one of the best human beings to be around. He embraces everything he has been through and found ways to improve. It takes a lot of humility to go through something like that.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/06/luka-doncic_kyrie-irving-2024-06-c1fdaa0545e247b0497f6616fd327140-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHealthier and happier, as he likes to say, Irving is back on the biggest stage in his sport with the Mavs set to face the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals starting Thursday night.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThroughout the deepest playoff run for Dallas in 13 years, the reflective side of Irving has surfaced frequently, stopping short of mea culpas but making clear he's learned a lot along the way.\n\n\"I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (stuff) a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level,\" Irving said.\n\n\"It wasn't a great reflection on my end towards the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment, no matter what people are yelling at you.\"\n\nBefore jilting Boston fans by signing with the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019, Irving was already a polarizing player.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThen came the COVID-19 pandemic and Irving's refusal to get vaccinated, which meant he couldn't play home games for Brooklyn because of New York City's vaccine mandate for employees.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNext was Irving's social media post of a link to a movie containing antisemitic material, which led to a suspension from the Nets and the end of his longtime business relationship with Nike.\n\nUltimately, Irving asked out of Brooklyn, and he and Durant were traded days apart last year, giving Irving a new co-star in Mavs point guard Luka Doncic.\n\nThe former No. 1 overall pick out of Duke had never been anywhere near Texas in his career but was greeted by two familiar faces. Mavs general manager Nico Harrison used to work for Nike, and coach Jason Kidd was the point guard of the then-New Jersey Nets when Irving was growing up in that area.\n\nIrving caught up with the team in Los Angeles after the trade, and the Mavericks won their first two games with him.\n\n\"You could see the smile,\" Kidd said. \"You could see the relief, or you could see that he was ready to have fun and play the game that he loves.\"\n\nThe partial season together didn't work out for Irving and Doncic. Dallas missed the playoffs. The first full season together was what the Mavs expected when they pulled off Harrison's first blockbuster trade.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA late-season surge lifted the Mavs to fifth in the West, although they've been the lower seed throughout these playoffs.\n\nDallas beat the Los Angeles Clippers in six games in the first round, ousting Tyronn Lue, Irving's coach from his championship season alongside LeBron James in Cleveland in 2016.\n\n\"He's very, very patient,\" Lue said after that series of the difference between the Irving he coached and today's version. \"You couldn't get this Kyrie when I had him. He wants to kill you every moment, every second. But now you can see, he's just letting the game come to him.\"\n\nThe Mavs beat top-seeded Oklahoma City in six games before knocking out No. 3 Minnesota in five games in the Western Conference finals, the clincher giving Dallas a five-game road winning streak in the playoffs.\n\n\"I feel like it's a great chapter that's being written right now,\" Irving said. \"I'm enjoying every step of the way. I'm not taking anything for granted. I'm enjoying the hot weather right now. I'm enjoying the Dallas community. We talked about this early in the season, just how much I felt embraced.\"\n\nIrving went on to say it went deeper than that, reminding reporters of an entire career spent in the other conference.\n\n\"Seasonal depression is real when you're growing up in the north,\" Irving said. \"I spent 12 years in the Eastern Conference in three cold cities that deal with four seasons. So you come out here and you're able to get outside and ground yourself a little bit more and spend some time with your family. Watch your kids run outside.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIrving and Doncic have at least another season together. Irving has a player option for 2025-26, Doncic for the season after that.\n\nKidd believes a preseason trip to Madrid, where Doncic grew as a teenaged pro in the EuroLeague, helped the two superstars bond.\n\nNow, winning is cementing that bond, one of the most poignant moments for the pair coming in the final seconds of Game 3 against the Timberwolves, after the Mavs knew they had clinched a 3-0 lead.\n\n\"When we were winning by nine on that last possession, I told (Irving), 'I'm tired,' and he told me, 'That's the way it's supposed to be,'\" Doncic said. \"He brought the calmness to the team and to me. He brought the maturity. I'm learning from him every day.\"\n\nThere might not have been many teammates lining up to say those things in Irving's first three stops, and the magnitude looms larger with the words coming from the face of the Dallas franchise.\n\nEven though his relationships with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and some of his other former Boston teammates are fine, Irving believes he is a better teammate now than he was then.\n\n\"The greatest thing I learned from Boston was just being able to manage not only my emotions, but just what's going on on a day-to-day basis of being a leader of a team or being one of the leaders and having young guys around you that have their own goals,\" Irving said. \"You have to learn how to put the big picture first.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA more introspective Irving is on the big stage again, and knows what's coming from the crowd in Boston.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news",

Had I known Irving would re-sign with the franchise, the move would have earned an A.\n\nMy reasoning for the optimism was simple: Irving immediately became the best teammate Doncic had ever had and Dallas was showing a desire to move away from the middle of the pack in the Western Conference.

Kyrie Irving built a relationship with Bryant, where mentorship became a valuable element of his life, extending beyond what happens on the basketball court and how he can become an even greater player.\n\nAs the NBA Finals nears, Irving acknowledged that he misses his mentor in Bryant. \"I don't know if anyone here has ever lost a mentor or someone older who meant something to them,\" he said. \"Even if you didn't talk every day, there was still that connection that they would always be there for you. It wasn't just him; it was his family as well. They supported me unconditionally, and I miss him every single day, just like the rest of the world and all the Kobe supporters.\"\n\nIrving shared some of the inspiration he found in Bryant, between the ability to leverage his presence on and off the court, powering through fatigue, and how he navigated off-court life. \"He held such a big presence and knew his superpowers weren't just on the court but in how he approached life,\" he said. \"He inspired you to do extra even when you got tired. His life lessons transcended basketball, any sport, or entertainment business.\n\nThe 32-year-old superstar has helped guide the Dallas Mavericks to an NBA Finals appearance and is set to compete against the Boston Celtics in Game 1 on Thursday. Irving has thrived next to Luka Doncic as a superstar team on a tough defensive squad. Like Bryant, Irving has many young players who look up to him and are inspired by his masterful skill, which Irving understands he must help pass on to the next generation of players, similar to how Bryant showed him.\n\n\"He sparked new ideas for the next generation to carry the torch. That's what he was teaching me: to carry the torch and know how to pass it along,\" Irving said.\n\nWhen discussing Bryant's legacy, Irving also revealed his goal of winning multiple championships. Irving is set to compete in his fourth NBA Finals and won a title with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. \"Along that journey, he won a few championships that I still admire and am still chasing to a certain degree. I want to sit at that table and say I have multiple championships in the best league in the world,\" he said.\n\nWhile keeping the end goal in mind, Irving emphasized the value Bryant found in the journey to reaching such a milestone, which he tried to follow. Not getting caught up in how they\n\n\"But in the small dose of truth, he always reminded me to enjoy the journey because the journey is the reward. He put it in perspective: billions of people will love you, and billions won't,\" Irving said. \"So, you should stick to your guns and go with the people who support you through and through. Make them proud and make yourself proud.\"\n\nAfter Bryant's passing in 2020, Irving still feels his presence in spirit and is grateful to have learned from him. He reminisces on the time he had the chance to compete against him one-on-one and directly learn from him. However, the value of life beyond just basketball is something Irving credits Bryant for helping him to get passionate about and find his formula.\n\n\"Every day, he walks with me in spirit. I feel his presence daily, and I'm grateful I got to know someone like him,\" Irving said. \"I got a chance to challenge him one-on-one and pick his brain. He taught me that there are bigger things than just basketball, like women's empowerment and selflessly helping the world. He helped many people without anyone's praise. I try to follow in that lineage and create my own path, my own formula for success, while also commemorating the formula he gave me.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/dallas_basketball/01hzgd5ah8c2jwe1226x.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Among his fascinated observers is LeBron James, who won a title with Irving in 2016 when rallying the Cleveland Cavaliers back from a 3-1 series deficit.\n\nDuring an episode of the \"Mind The Game\" podcast, James described Irving as \"the wizard\" for his skill. James also mentioned how much he misses playing with him. \"Listen, I will call Kyrie the wizard all the time. Like all the time,\" he said. \"There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do. And sitting here watching it, I'm like, I'm so f*****g happy and so proud to watch him and continue his growth or whatever the case may be. And at the same time, I'm so f*****g mad that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nWhen reflecting on his time as Irving's teammate, James compared him to being \"the ultimate wild card\" on the court, pointing to the explosive 24-point first half Irving had in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals after previously averaging a reduced volume.\n\n\"I just remember those times, and to have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card, that's like having a draw four in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno. ... It's all in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals. Until then, I think Kyrie was only averaging eight points in the first half, like in the second round of the playoffs.\"\n\n\"He was getting a 16 to 20 in the second half. But in the first half of games. It was like six, it was like six to eight. I don't remember the exact number,\" James explained. \"And you're like, 'Okay, you gonna have Kyrie in the fourth, but I need you sometimes in the first half too, brother.' But like what he did in Game 1, it was like at the, at the Western Conference finals, you was like, 'Oh shit, Dallas may be able to not only win the Western Conference Finals, they might be able to win the whole thing because of that wild card.' \"\n\nJames described Irving as the most \"gifted\" NBA player he's ever seen. \"I don't have many words to praise Kyrie, and I end up with absolutely none because he's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen,\" he said. \"He has the best gifts I've ever seen of any NBA player. \"\n\nIrving's ability to use his left hand just as well as his right fascinates James, describing it as something he's never seen before. \"I've never seen a guy in my NBA life that feels better at times shooting with his offhand than he does with his primary hand,\" he said. \"If Kyrie's off in a game with his right hand, he will literally go exclusively to his left hand. I've never seen nothing like that.\n\nJames provided an example of Irving's game-winning running hook, which he hit from a distance against the Denver Nuggets, turning the corner and completing the play over Nikola Jokic's contest. \"The shot, one thing I'm thinking, the shot that he made versus Denver towards the regular end of the regular season on [Nikola Jokic], it's one of the most ridiculous shots I've ever seen in my life,\" he said. \"He's just that special.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3392,h_1908,x_0,y_861/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/dallas_basketball/01hzjb5zf7bagm17edx3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

For Doncic, it will be the first time he's been in this kind of situation, but with the way he acquitted himself in the West Finals, the assumption is he will provide his usual production. Irving is a bit more of a wild card, but he's the only guy in the Mavs main rotation with the experience of winning a championship.\n\nThat title run came with LeBron James in Cleveland in 2016, where Kyrie elevated his game to an incredible level over the second half of that series to help the Cavs pull off the improbable comeback over the Warriors. At the time, Irving was the youngster experiencing his first Finals alongside a grizzled vet in James, but now the roles are reversed with Doncic. For James, he loves seeing Kyrie back on that stage and heaped praise on his former teammate, while noting his jealousy watching the Mavs because he no longer gets to play alongside him.\n\nAs James put it, Kyrie is the \"most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\" There are a lot of players that share that belief about Irving, as he has an incredible amount of respect among his peers for his skill level as a playmaker, shotmaker, and creator. His combination of ball-handling, finishing at the rim, and tough shot-making makes him a favorite of a lot of NBA greats, who may have more physical advantages but envy Irving's dexterity with the basketball in his hands.\n\nWhile James will be watching proudly as Irving looks to lead the Mavs to a title, Kyrie will be facing another of his former teams in the Celtics. They'll know his tricks firsthand and have a keen understanding of what he's going to want to do. The problem is, knowing where Kyrie wants to go and stopping him from getting there are two very different challenges.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "uproxx_music@uproxx.com", "name": "Uproxx Music", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "grant_sharples@uproxx.com", "name": "Grant Sharples", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lebron-kyrie-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Even though Holiday is considered one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA, he revealed the only thing he can do to stop Irving in the series is to rely on divine intervention.\n\n\"Pray.\"\n\nWhen you look at the physical matchup of the two guards, it seems like Holiday is physically well-equipped to bother Irving one-on-one. But Holiday has experienced Irving's lightning-quick handles and speed multiple times in his career before.\n\nThe pair have faced off in 20 NBA games over their careers with Irving averaging 24.2 points, 4.9 assists, and 4.7 rebounds over these encounters. Some of these matchups are still in Kyrie's all-time highlight reel, especially his 49-point masterclass against Jrue and the Pelicans in 2017.\n\nIrving also has multiple 30-point games in matchups against Holiday, showing that Jrue's defensive instinct and strength aren't enough to consistently bother Irving's speed, skill, and finishing ability. But even though Irving can put up numbers, he is 6-14 all-time in the various matchups they've had over the last 13 seasons.\n\nHoliday has been solid in this matchup as well, averaging 17.7 points, 6.3 assists and 4.8 rebounds. While he isn't a lock to stop Irving, he will fare better than most guards in the NBA when it comes to limiting the 32-year-old Mavericks' guard.\n\nKyrie Irving Is Returning To Boston Without Negative Feelings For The City\n\nOne of the most fascinating sub-plots of the 2024 NBA Finals is the return of Kyrie to Boston, with many calling Irving one of the most hated athletes in the city's history for his doomed two-year stint with the Celtics from 2017 to 2019.\n\nDespite how poorly their tenure ended and how Irving disrespected the franchise in later encounters, he's coming into the Finals with a positive outlook on the city for playing a role in his journey.\n\n\"I would not be here without Boston, literally and figuratively just because without me going through what I went through here, I would not be who I am today... It's just accepting what I've gone through, who I was, forgiving that person, forgiving myself. I've done my best not to play the blame game. It's so easy to blame others or blame what's going on outside of you but once you go inside and you figure out who you are it's pretty easy to navigate.\"\n\nIrving has averaged 23.9 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.3 assists against the Celtics since his departure in 2019. He is currently on a 10-game losing streak against the 17-time champions, all coming after Irving stepped on their team logo at half-court and appeared to wipe his feet on their mascot, 'Lucky'.\n\nWhile the Boston fanbase will be treating Kyrie like a villain upon his return, it seems he will try to maintain his composure while facing the franchise he once promised to re-sign with before joining their divisional rivals. Let bygones be bygones and enjoy a compelling basketball storyline play out in the 2024 Finals.\n\nRelated: Kyrie Irving Says He 'Lost His Sh*t' Against Celtics In 2021 And 2022 Playoff Series\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

But in reality, the Mavericks won in a big way.\n\nGet on Board the NBA Finals | Dallas Mavericks v Boston Celtics | Every game of the NBA Finals LIVE on ESPN, available via Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nBy throwing away the game against the Bulls, Dallas improved its chances of keeping its first-round pick in that year's draft.\n\nQuickly for context, in case you have forgotten by now, the Mavericks still owed a first-round pick to the New York Knicks as part of the trade for Kristaps Porzingis in 2019 at that point.\n\nBut if the draft lottery handed them a top-10 selection, they wouldn't have to give it up. A lower finish in the overall standings, of course, gave them better odds of drawing a top-10 pick.\n\nThe Mavericks were fined $750,000 after that league investigation was completed but it mattered little as they drew the No.10 pick, later trading back on draft day to select rookie big man Dereck Lively II at 12th overall.\n\nThe same Lively II who has been a rookie revelation this season, exceeding everyone's expectations -- including his own -- and developing an immediate connection with Luka Doncic.\n\nThe same Luka Doncic who, according to ESPN's Tim MacMahon, had \"publicly and privately expressed extreme frustration\" during the 2022-23 season.\n\nTeam sources told ESPN at the time a \"fear\" existed that Doncic \"could consider requesting a trade as soon as the summer of 2024 if Dallas doesn't make significant progress by then\".\n\nNow Dallas is just four games away from lifting the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\n\nDoncic, meanwhile, is on the verge of joining the likes of Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo as recent NBA champions who could have so easily become the latest superstars to force their way out as part of the league's player empowerment era.\n\nInstead they stayed patient. Instead, they trusted their front offices to do right by them.\n\nNow both have rings to show for it. Soon, Doncic could too.\n\n\"He'd like to be here the whole time,\" Mavericks co-owner Cuban told ESPN at the time.\n\n\"But we've got to earn that.\"\n\nDallas did just that at this year's trade deadline, making a pair of strategic moves to build around Doncic, having already put the perfect co-star next to him in Irving.\n\nBut not everyone believed Irving was the ideal fit, with one ESPN writer giving the trade a 'D' grade -- and Irving hasn't forgotten it.\n\nThere has been plenty written about the eight-time All-Star over the years and with time, Irving has found his own way of dealing with that reality.\n\n\"All the stories and narratives are going to exist forever,\" he told reporters after Dallas clinched its NBA Finals berth.\n\n\"I'm sure I'll hear it until I retire. But again, this is what comes with this industry.\"\n\nIt doesn't mean Irving isn't allowed to have a little bit of fun with it though. He has a folder in his phone, exclusively for memes -- and there is one that is particularly satisfying to look back at.\n\n\"ESPN gave us a grade D for the trade of me coming here,\" Irving said after a 109-95 win over Atlanta, which secured Dallas' spot in the playoffs.\n\n\"I think us clinching a playoff spot and putting ourselves in a great position definitely answers some of those questions that were asked last season by some of the naysayers and all of that stuff.\"\n\nSome of the naysayers pointed to on-court concerns, questioning whether Irving and Doncic would be just the latest example of two ball-dominant superstars failing to co-exist.\n\nMost, however, were more worried by the off-court distractions, cautious to completely buy into the idea of an Irving and Doncic backcourt given the way things ended in Boston and Brooklyn.\n\nAnd there was a chance things could end even more abruptly in Dallas given Irving was a chance of becoming an unrestricted free agent after just a few months with the Mavericks.\n\nIn other words, Dallas were gambling on giving up Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith and an unprotected 2029 first-round pick for a short-term rental.\n\n\"The Mavs could either have four seasons of the best backcourt in the league. Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic. Are you kidding? That's incredible.\n\n\"Or they could have six months of that, flame out in the playoffs and then Kyrie goes to the Lakers.\n\n\"Or they could completely alienate their star who is supposed to be the saviour of the franchise after Dirk Nowitzki left by bringing in a combustible second star who may not totally want to be there long-term, leaving Luka even more barren and alone in Dallas.\n\n\"All three of those are really on the table here for Dallas.\"\n\nFortunately for Dallas, it ended up being the first option as Irving re-signed on a three-year, $126 million deal and formed what Stan Van Gundy described as \"arguably the best offensive backcourt in the history of the NBA\".\n\nIrving has been the perfect sidekick, if that is even the right word for what he has been doing these playoffs, averaging 22.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and 5.2 assists while shooting 42.1 per cent from deep.\n\nHe has been playing the best postseason defence in his career too and that has been bringing the best out of Doncic, who has also been much-improved on that side of the floor.\n\n\"Those two worked at it,\" Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said.\n\n\"It just didn't happen overnight. That's a beautiful thing. It's alright to be wrong. We're not always right. But it's a beautiful combination.\n\n\"Those two play off each other. You can see that they care about one another. They're in competition with each other on who's playing the best defence and that's kind of cool to see because when you used to look at Kai and Luka, a lot of times we're not known for our defensive guys but they're competing.\"\n\nMore than anything though, even if it is a simplistic way of looking at it, the most important thing is that, finally, Irving is just playing basketball.\n\nAnd that hasn't always been a guarantee with Irving, who was both a walking human highlight reel on the court and walking human headline off it during his time at Brooklyn.\n\nIn his final season, it was the refusal to get vaccinated for Covid-19, which saw him miss two-thirds of the season, and the promotion of a video that shared anti-Semitic views.\n\nEven on the court Irving wasn't a stranger to drama, stomping on the Celtics logo in his second game back at TD Garden and flipping off fans who yelled explicit chants at him.\n\n\"Kyrie Irving has been great. He came to Dallas and there's no drama there. We haven't heard anything out of him,\" Dan Patrick said this week on his show.\n\n\"And that's good, because we do just want to see him play basketball. The other stuff, the off-the-court stuff, if he revisits that when he's done, great.\n\n\"I like to see a player who has that much talent to be back on the big stage again, and he's been through an awful lot. But at 32, all the sudden you look around and go 'this isn't going to last much longer, how do I want to be remembered?'\n\n\"Does he care about how he wants to be remembered? But when he does play, when he wants to play, he's remarkable. Was Dallas desperate? Maybe.\n\n\"But Mark Cuban was not afraid to take a chance. Kyrie had to respect Luka, had to respect Jason Kidd. He had to be willing to be a great team player and realise that you're not going to be the guy.\n\n\"He had to be a bit submissive to Luka, because it's Luka's team. And Kyrie has done a wonderful job.\"\n\nA frank Irving admitted he \"wasn't my best self\" during his time at Boston, but equally told reporters this week there could have been \"a little bit more grace extended my way\".\n\n\"Especially with what I was dealing with during that time as a human being,\" he added.\n\nIt also seems like Irving has come to terms with the fact that no matter what he does and no matter what he says, people are always going to have opinions on him -- another sign of the 32-year-old's growth since his Boston days.\n\n\"When you're in a professional environment such as this and you can only be judged by your on-court performances and what people say off the court, and they don't know who you are, I think that's a little unfair,\" Irving said.\n\n\"But that's the life we live in and life is just not fair all the time. I just stopped being a kid towards this industry and just grew up and grew wings. I just developed a mentality to be able to brush off a lot of that stuff.\"\n\nOf course, as much as Irving has obviously helped lift the ceiling of this team, any discussion on Dallas' charge to the NBA Finals has to involve the moves it made around the margins.\n\nStarting with the trade deadline acquisitions of Daniel Gafford and P.J. Washington, who bolstered the Mavericks' frontcourt after an underwhelming start to the season.\n\nIt can be easy to forget that Dallas had a 29-23 record before the deadline, ranking just 22nd in defensive rating, 12th in offence and 17th in net rating.\n\nA lot of that came back to Irving and Doncic not being healthy, missing 22 and eight games respectively.\n\nBut either way, provided the superstar duo were on the court when it mattered most, it was still clear that the Mavericks needed more -- especially on the defensive end.\n\nAdding Washington gave Dallas a disruptive defender and extra scoring option, with the former Hornet coming up clutch in the playoffs with a number of big-time shots in big-time moments.\n\nGafford, meanwhile, eased the pressure on rookie Lively II to perform right away while his effective rim protection proved particularly important against the Minnesota frontcourt.\n\nBeyond Gafford and Washington, Derrick Jones Jr. has proven a shrewd free agency pick-up after Dallas signed him to a veteran's minimum one-year deal in the summer.\n\nEven coach Kidd, meanwhile, deserves plenty of credit after being questioned for his rotations in the regular season before finding a formula that helped Dallas to a 22-9 record after the trade deadline and, now, an NBA finals appearance.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that the Mavericks wouldn't be in this position without Doncic, who ranks first for points, rebounds, assists, steals, field goals, 3-pointers and free throws this playoffs.\n\nBut everyone already knew Doncic was good. He was never the one holding this team back. In fact, the conversation was always about how the Mavericks were holding him back.\n\nNow, nothing is holding Doncic and Dallas back from winning the team's first championship in 13 years and like reigning champions Denver, there is something to be said about the way the Mavericks patiently waited, knowing with the right pieces, they could reach this point.\n\nIt took a bit of time for the Doncic-Irving backcourt combination to flourish too but now, as Gafford put it after Dallas' series-sealing win over Minnesota, we are witnessing \"greatness\".\n\n\"In all honesty, I'd say it's the patience when it comes to just being around each other,\" Gafford said.\n\n\"When I was first seeing the trade when Kyrie got here, they said, 'Oh, him and Luka is not going to work'. They're working pretty good together right now, if I do say so myself.\n\n\"So whoever said that, they obviously need to go get their eyes checked. Just watching it, to me, it's just greatness.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With his incredible basketball skills, the star was also known for his 'Mamba Mentality' which inspired many along the way. As Kyrie Irving was one of those students, the Mavericks guard has been hugely impacted by Bryant.\n\nAs Kyrie Irving has now reached the finals for yet another time, the athlete took the opportunity to express how he feels about the absence of Bryant. Irving revealed that not only Bryant but his family also supported the Mavericks' star.\n\nBryant also talked about Bryant's inspirational presence and approach to life that not giving up mindset. According the Irving, Kobe Bryant's impact will help the next generation as it will get passed on by players such as himself. Irving then concluded that he was aiming at getting multiple champions just like his mentor.\n\nIrving has not made it to the finals after Bryant's passing in 2020. After struggles with changing teams and injuries, Irving has made it to the finals again after six years. The star now has a chance to add another title with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nKyrie Irving practiced in the mirror before challenging Kobe Bryant\n\nDespite not playing together on the same team in the NBA, Irving did get a chance to play alongside Bryant during the Olympics. At the time Irving was a rookie full of passion and confidence. The guard even went up to challenge Bryant one-on-one during the Olympics' practice.\n\nIrving's statement shocked many including Bryant due to his confidence. However, years after the incident, Irving opened up about how nervous he was while approaching Bryant. Irving opened up about the moment as he sat with Kevin Durant on his podcast.\n\nAfter that, the relationship between the two flourished and Bryant guided Irving in his career. The Lakers star also had a huge influence on the Mavericks guard during the 2016 NBA finals which led Irving to win his first and only championship.\n\nIn Case You Missed It:", "source": {"uri": "firstsportz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FirstSportz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kobe-Bryant-Kyrie-Irving.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Coach Jason Kidd played a crucial role in the Mavericks' trade to acquire Kyrie Irving, urging the front office to \"go get him.\" Despite their initial struggles, Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving look like one of the most talented backcourts ever.\n\nEvery superstar needs a running mate to win. Luka Don\u010di\u0107 had to wait until halfway through his fifth season to get a true championship-caliber co-star in Kyrie Irving. However, had it not been for Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, this dynamic duo would probably not have come into existence.\n\nThe Mavs had tried pairing Don\u010di\u0107 with Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is initially, but that was an unfruitful union. The Latvian couldn't stay healthy and the first time he was tested in the playoffs, he wilted. So they traded him away.\n\nThe following season, the Brooklyn Nets made Irving available during a roster clear-out. Kidd told Vincent Goodwill Yahoo Sports that's when he had a conversation with Mavs general manager Nico Harrison about bringing Irving in.\n\n\"Go get him. Get him. We need another star. We felt that he fit next to Luka, and he was able to get him. Because we knew Kai ... and it all worked out. I mean, Kai participated at a high level. But you can see he's having fun. The joy of basketball is at a high. But the trust that he has in Niko and myself is at a high too, and I think we were honest with him, and he was honest with us.\" - Jason Kidd\n\nNot only did the Mavericks have the best assets to get Irving, but they also had the relationship to convince him. Harrison, who was a former executive at Nike for almost two decades, had worked with Irving previously for the shoe company. So when Kidd told Harrison he wanted the three-time All-NBA guard, he got the deal done quickly.\n\nContrasting Two Seasons for Irving in Dallas From missing the playoffs to the NBA Finals the following year\n\nWhen Irving made his debut in February last year, the Mavericks had a 30-26 record and were the fourth seed. They went 8-12 in the 20 games he played in, finishing as the 11th seed with a dismal 38-44 record.\n\nThe Mavs received a lot of criticism at the time for the move since the team looked disorganized, and the star duo couldn't figure out a way to play alongside each other. There were concerns that Dallas might not extend a new contract to Irving, an impending free agent.\n\nHowever, going into the lottery meant the Mavs could draft Dereck Lively, who has been a huge part of their revival this season. And after getting an off-season to work with each other, Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving looked like a dynamic duo to start the 2023-24 season.\n\nWhen the Mavs looked like they had hit their ceiling with the existing roster, Harrison made two key trades for PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford, which elevated their play. They ended up with a 50-32 record, good for fifth in the Western Conference, with Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving leading the way. They silenced their doubters once again after their regular season success translated into the playoffs as well.\n\nFrom looking like a disjointed duo to one of the best backcourts the league has ever seen, Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving are now in the NBA Finals with a chance to get the Mavericks their second championship.\n\nRelated Kyrie Irving Says He's Grown Since Last Playoff Matchup With Celtics Kyrie Irving is going up against his old team in the NBA Finals, but he's a new man now.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-31-may-2024-01-26-pm-1159.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

James highlighted Irving's extraordinary skills, likening him to an unbeatable draw-four card in Uno, always ready to change the game's outcome.\n\n\"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card, that's like having a draw four in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno... In game one, Western Conference Finals, game one.\"\n\n\"You know, I think up until that point, I don't know the stat, cause I'm not writing down the stats and I don't call the games like you guys, but I think Kyrie was only averaging like six to eight points in the first half, like in the second round of the playoffs.\"\n\nYou know, he was getting 16 to 20 in the second half, but in the first half of games, you know, he wasn't. And you're like, you're gonna have Kyrie in the fourth, but I need you sometimes in the first half too, brother.\"\n\n\"But like what he did in game one, it was like at a Western Conference Finals, it was like, that was like, oh shit, I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with absolutely none because it's just, it's so, he's the most gifted player that NBA has ever seen.\"\n\n\"He has the best gifts I've ever seen of any NBA player. I've never seen a guy in my NBA life that feels better feels better at times shooting with his offhand than he does with this with his primary.\"\n\n\"If Kyrie's off in a game with his right hand, he will literally go exclusively to his left hand. I've never seen nothing like that. The shot, one thing I'm thinking the shot that he made versus Denver toward the end of the regular season on on Joker. Yeah. It's one of the most ridiculous shots I've ever seen in my life.\" (1:39)\n\nJames emphasized that Irving's talent is unparalleled, especially his ability to perform under pressure. Reflecting on their time together, he recalled how Irving would often score modestly in the first half of games, only to explode in the second half. This pattern was evident during their playoff runs, where Irving would save his best for the crucial moments, particularly in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nOne standout performance that underscores Irving's talent was in Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Irving exploded for 24 points in the first half and finished with 30 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists, leading the Mavericks to a 1-0 series lead. This game epitomized Irving's ability to dominate and shift the momentum when needed.\n\nLeBron marveled at Irving's ambidexterity, noting that he has never seen a player who could switch to his offhand with such ease and still perform at an elite level. Irving's ability to make incredible shots, even under the tightest defenses, left James in awe. He recounted a specific instance from a regular-season game against the Denver Nuggets, where Irving made a jaw-dropping shot over Nikola Jokic, labeling it one of the most ridiculous shots he had ever witnessed.\n\nJJ Redick echoed LeBron's sentiments, expressing doubt that there's a player more aesthetically pleasing to watch when in rhythm than Kyrie Irving. This season, Irving has proven his mettle once again by leading the Dallas Mavericks to the NBA Finals alongside Luka Doncic. Irving's playoff performance has been stellar, averaging 22.8 points, 5.2 assists, and 3.9 rebounds, showcasing his ability to deliver when it matters most.\n\nIrving's journey back to the NBA Finals, his first since 2017, is a testament to his enduring talent and determination. As the Mavericks prepare to face the Boston Celtics, Irving's exceptional skills and playoff experience will be crucial in their quest for the championship.\n\nLeBron's high praise underscores the unique and remarkable nature of Kyrie Irving's abilities, solidifying his status as one of the most gifted players the NBA has ever seen.\n\nRelated: Kendrick Perkins Advices Boston Celtics Fans To Leave Kyrie Irving Alone\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

I've been able to grow since then. So, of course, it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship to have with the fans.\"\n\nThat is what Kyrie Irving said to the media on Monday's NBA Finals press conference regarding returning to Boston and dealing with the scrutiny and animosity that will come his way in this series from their fanbase. The now 32-year-old spent two seasons with the Celtics following a trade out of Cleveland and many Boston fans were upset with his departure, thinking he quit on the team in the 2019 Playoffs so he could team up with his good friend Kevin Durant on the Nets.\n\nREAD MORE: Kyrie Irving 'Appreciated' LeBron James' Comments, Misses Playing Together\n\nSince that departure in free agency, it's been far from water under the bridge between Irving and the Celtics' fanbase. It's more like the bridge was set on fire on both ends and continued to have fuel thrown on.\n\nBetween his aforementioned double birds behind his head to fans on an inbound pass, stepping on Boston's midcourt logo \"Lucky\", one fan throwing a water bottle at him as he's walking into the tunnel, him cussing out a fan in the tunnel as he's walking back into the locker room, burning sage in the arena, and referring to the Celtics' fans as \"the scorned girlfriend that just wants an explanation for why I left but still hoping for a text back,\" there's been no shortage of drama between the two sides.\n\nMany saw Irving as a flight risk when the Mavericks traded for him for these and a litany of other reasons from his time with the Nets. Those doubts were only amplified when Dallas fell out of the playoff chase entirely after trading for him at the 2023 trade deadline, as many wondered if he could co-exist with superstar Luka Doncic or if he'd force his way to another destination. Even once he re-signed with Dallas this past offseason, people said he'd be asking for a trade to the LA Lakers to team back up with LeBron James before 2023 turned to 2024.\n\nNot only has Irving found a way to co-exist with Doncic, but he's stepped up as a veteran presence and as a \"calming voice,\" as he said in that same press conference on Monday. As much as his on-court productivity has helped the Mavericks get to The Finals, his leadership and maturity have taken massive strides since his days in Boston and Brooklyn. You have often seen Irving on the broadcast telling his teammates to focus and move on to the next play, whether they're coming off a highlight or a turnover.\n\nDoncic is on record saying Irving has \"helped me mature a lot and realize to see the game in a different way... On the court it's amazing to play with a guy like him. Just go out there and enjoy. The leader he's been for us... has been amazing. Always positive energy.\"\n\nAll of that growth and maturity will be tested starting on Thursday when Dallas tips off in the NBA Finals at Boston. As great as he's been for Dallas' locker room, the national media still has doubts that he's come this far from asking for a trade away from LeBron James eight years ago with a desire to be the front-man on a team to happily nestling in as the number two option in Dallas alongside Doncic. He can prove that by responding well to what's expected to be a raucous environment.\n\nPart of responding well is playing well. Irving hasn't played well recently against his former team, averaging 20.8 PPG while shooting 42.2% from the floor in his last ten games (regular season and playoffs) against the Celtics, all of which were losses. The Mavs can't afford many missteps in this series with a championship on the line against the NBA's best team in the regular season.\n\nOn a team full of players who have never been on this stage, they're going to be looking to Irving for advice early and often as he's appearing in his 4th NBA Finals. If he keeps being the same person he's been in these playoffs, which I'd be willing to bet on, Dallas will have a great chance to win this series. If he allows Boston's words and jabs to get under his skin, this could be a quick series.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4420,h_2486,x_0,y_195/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/dallas_basketball/01hzh0vzx0ne436hqahp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

To be able to now give wisdom and also speak from a place of experience. When you're a young person, again, you're trying to speed through life, you're trying to get through everything.\"\n\nIrving also spoke about the supportive environment he's found in the Mavericks organization, thriving within the structure of the franchise better than he could with the Nets.\n\n\"This is a supportive environment, and there's a lot of energy and positivity, then this is where I thrive and this is good, fun, good-hearted people. Not saying I didn't have that in Brooklyn, I was just saying that it's all about organizational structure, and it's all about how you treat your veterans. It's all about how you treat your star players. It's all about how you treat people with respect.\"\n\nIrving averaged 25.6 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 5.2 assists in the regular season this year, helping the Mavericks land 50 wins and getting a nice contract bonus as a result of that.\n\nWhile his scoring has gone down in the postseason, averaging 22.8 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 5.2 assists, Irving has wowed fans with his second-half scoring and incredible defense to help the Mavs make the NBA Finals.\n\nKyrie Irving Referred To Key Mavericks' Leaders As Family\n\nGoodwill's interview with Irving opens up with the 32-year-old guard talking about 'family' reaching out to him after it looked like his tenure with the Nets was finally over. The 'family' was Dallas Mavericks' GM Nico Harrison and head coach Jason Kidd.\n\nKidd, in particular, was actively pushing for the Mavs to acquire Kyrie because he felt like a change in his situation would revitalize the then-maligned star.\n\n\"Go get him. Get him (Kidd told Harrison). We need another star. We felt that he fit next to Luka, and he was able to get him... We believe that we have the people power to turn that around. Nico and myself as being the head of that because we knew Kai ... and it all worked out. I mean, Kai participated at a high level. But you can see he's having fun. The joy of basketball is at a high. But the trust that he has in Niko and myself is at a high too, and I think we were honest with him and he was honest with us.\"\n\nWith his fourth trip to the NBA Finals tipping off in two days, Irving reflected on going to the Finals one season after missing the Playoffs entirely.\n\n\"Like, because when you're in it, and you're in it, and you're, like, I want to enjoy it. You don't know how because you're thinking about beyond. You get kicked out of the playoffs in April last year. I had to live with that the whole summer. And it's not too often you're back [in the Finals] after seven years.\"\n\nThe Mavericks have reaped the rewards of a locked-in Kyrie, who has the opportunity to get his revenge against one of the fanbases that have actively rooted for his downfall.

Shoutout to [LeBron James] for that. He knows how to stir up a media storm,\" Irving said.\n\nAs the Mavericks are just four wins away from clinching their second NBA trophy, Irving's primary focus is on the upcoming finals. With this mindset, Irving aims to employ the strategies and leadership techniques he absorbed during his time with LeBron.\n\n\"Definitely think about those times but now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect... now I'm at this stage able to use some of the formulas I was taught from him [LeBron].\"\n\nThroughout his career, Kyrie Irving has learned from some exceptional leaders. He is now applying those lessons to guide the young Mavericks squad. His leadership has been instrumental in leading the Mavericks to the NBA Finals for the first time in 13 years, which also marked Irving's return to the Finals after a seven-year hiatus.\n\nSeeing Irving's dedicated leadership, teammate Luka Doncic couldn't help but praise him for keeping the team united and motivated.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing. The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it. He's keeping us all together and motivated,\" Doncic said.\n\nIrving is now in the NBA Finals for the fourth time. With Game 1 set to occur on Thursday, he is rushing to help the Mavericks secure their second NBA trophy.

He plays both sides of the ball when he has to but his offensive skill set is pretty special.\"\n\nDoncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.8 assists and 9.2 rebounds a game this season and even after his deep NBA run said he hopes to play for Slovenian in upcoming Paris Olympic qualifying.\n\n\"We'll see how my knee is, but if it's good, I'm going to go play,\" Doncic said.\n\nStill just 25, Doncic is one step from the crown he has dreamed of grabbing.\n\n\"Amazing. First time in the NBA Finals. Hopefully not the last,\" he said. \"Never take it for granted. You never know if you're going to come back so just enjoy the experience.\"\n\nIt's much the same lesson stressed by Irving, who won an NBA title with LeBron James with Cleveland in 2016.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing, the way he connects us,\" Doncic said of Irving. \"He's the one who has been to the finals, who has won the finals, so he's really leading it right now. He's keeping us all together and motivated.\"\n\nEight seasons and three teams later, Irving has been through anti-Semitic and anti-vaccine controversies and backed controversial conspiracy theories but set aside talk to focus on basketball with great success.\n\n\"Some things he has done special in practice, it's insane,\" Doncic said. \"I never seen nobody make those shots. I never seen nobody try those shots. Just some shots are crazy. It's amazing to just experience it.\"\n\nJames, a four-time NBA Most Valuable Player, said on a podcast Tuesday that Irving was \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen\" and wished he was still playing alongside him -- praise that meant much to Irving on Wednesday.\n\n\"I have a great reaction. It's appreciated. There's obviously a lot of gratitude there as well,\" said Irving. \"I'm in a different position, a different place in my life. So is he. We've both been able to mature and really appreciate what we accomplished.\n\n\"There were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man and be comfortable in it... our relationship is different. Definitely miss him.\n\n\"Now I'm able to use some of the formulas I was taught by him. I'm built for this moment because of some of the things I've gone through in my past.\n\n\"Never regretful on how I treated it but a little disappointed how I approached that success.\n\n\"Basketball has been a great teacher for me but life has been a better one.\"\n\n'No fear out here'\n\nIrving has helped teammates channel the tough crowd Boston will present into support.\n\n\"You've just got to breathe through it and realize it's not as hostile as you think it is,\" he said. \"Some of that is anxiety. Some of that is nervousness. It can all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here. It's basketball.\"\n\nDallas forward P.J. Washington says Irving has relaxed the Mavs as they enter unfamiliar territory.\n\n\"Ky, he's done a great job of keeping us cool, calm and collected,\" Washington said. \"Just telling us to feel every emotion, come out and be ourselves.\"\n\nMavs center Daniel Gafford agreed, adding: \"Kyrie is one of the best human beings to be around.

LeBron wanted Kyrie to come to the Lakers. Now, LeBron going to Dallas, he's under contract, that's not feasible,\" Windhorst said. \"When it was relayed to me ... that Kyrie wanted LeBron in Dallas, I went and checked on it. Basically LeBron's side said, 'We'd love to play with Kyrie -- in L.A.' The Lakers actually could have created the cap space to beat the [Dallas] Mavericks' offer last year, but they elected not to. They elected to re-sign the players from the team that had just gotten to the Western Conference Finals.\"\n\nIrving ended up signing a three-year deal worth $120 million to remain in Dallas, which keeps him under contract through 2025-26 but also includes a player option for that final season.\n\nWindhorst's reporting, and the network's request for it, came on the eve of Irving's return to the NBA Finals six years since his last appearance on the sport's biggest stage. The last time he played for a title, Irving did so as James' sidekick on the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nJames left Cleveland the following offseason for Los Angeles, where he has remained ever since and where he captured the fourth championship ring of his career. Meanwhile, Irving played tumultuous and less successful stints with the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets before landing next to Luca Doncic as a member of the Mavericks.\n\n\"When Kyrie left Cleveland, [he and James] pretty much didn't talk for years. ... They were at odds,\" Windhorst said Wednesday. \"At some point in the last few years, they've made up -- to the point where LeBron actively wanted the Lakers to trade for Kyrie Irving when he was on the trade block a couple of different times in like 22', 23'. The Lakers made an offer at the trade deadline last year, Dallas' offer was just better. They [had] better players to trade and potentially more valuable picks.\"\n\nPlaying a strong second fiddle to arguably the best player in the league is what Irving is doing now with Doncic in Dallas, which echoes the precise situation he had with James in Cleveland when they made four consecutive trips to the Finals between 2015-18 and won a title together.\n\nEven though Doncic is clearly a superior player to James at the current points in their respective careers, it isn't unreasonable to assume the Lakers could have had similar success to that the Mavericks have found this postseason by re-pairing a matured and more even-keeled version of Irving alongside James -- not to mention with the added help of a superstar big man in Davis.\n\nMaking the move would have created difficulties for L.A. when it came to surrounding that potential Big 3 with talent, but title hopes and sunny Southern California would have certainly helped the franchise's cause of rounding out the roster.\n\nInstead, the Lakers will now watch the NBA Finals from home as they consider what might have been, after the Denver Nuggets dispatched them from the playoffs across a short series for the second consecutive year.\n\nJames seems already to be contemplating such things, as he noted during the June 4 edition of the \"Mind the Game\" podcast that he co-hosts with prospective Lakers head coach JJ Redick.\n\n\"I'm so f***ing happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth,\" James said. \"I'm so f***ing mad at the same time that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nIrving responded to James' praise on Wednesday.\n\n\"It's appreciated. There's a lot of gratitude there, as well. I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger,\" Irving said. \"Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now.

Kyrie Irving, fearless ahead of meeting with Celtics fans: I almost think about Gladiator\n\nDallas Mavericks' pointguard Kyrie Irving just reached the NBA finals alongside the likes of Luka Doncic, he is set to face the Boston Celtics' fanbase at the Garden at least twice. Why is that mentioned? Because Kyrie Irving doesn't have great history with the Boston Celtics fans, many of them can't stand him. It's a hate-hate rlationship through and through. Kyrie has already responded to some of those fans by flipping them inside the court and try to keep his cool as he is booed by everybody. It's a hard situation that Kyrie Irving knows can come back to haunt him. This exact behavior is what made him reflect and regret some of the things he did or said.\n\nThat middle finger Kyrie showed all the Celtics fans came during Game 1 of the first-round series between the Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets, where Kyrie was in 2022. Irving wasn't able to take the verbal abuse and responded with those middle fingers. That is exactly the moment Kyrie Irving completely regrets. Handling hostile environments is a rare skill that not all star athletes possess. Players often have to learn it and correct mistakes made previously. Kyrie is trying to do just that because otherwise, he will get into trouble with the Celtics fans again. Not being able to control himself could even drive him to be sanctioned by the NBA. Respecting the fans is the most important rule within the organization.\n\nKyrie spoke to the media on Monday ahead of the NBA Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics. He said: \"Last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s--- a little bit. That wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level. It wasn't a great reflection on my end toward the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment, no matter what people are yelling at you. I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that, and I've been able to grow since then. So of course it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship to have with the fans.\"", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/e926d7d8ae576b55579c09af19e259af/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/04/17175234178812.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Sometimes, he'll ask for clarity to be sure, or state, \"I'm trying to think of the best way to say this.\"\n\nPerhaps it's maturity or, even better, discernment -- making sure he's on message while still being himself, from the experiences over the past few years or, likely, the totality of his career to date.\n\nHe has often expressed how he has felt at a given moment, many times to his detriment. How he feels now only matters so much, so it doesn't have to be redemption. His actions are what count here, and the actions are creating a more complete picture.\n\nPerhaps it's realizing how close he was to losing it all and now he's back on the NBA Finals stage for the first time since 2017, when he was a much younger man.\n\n\"I don't want to call it a life raft or lifeline, but it was like family reaching out,\" Irving told Yahoo Sports last week during the Western Conference finals.\n\nThat family Irving referenced was Dallas Mavericks GM Nico Harrison, whose relationship with Irving goes back to Harrison's days as a Nike executive -- a place he'd been for nearly 20 years -- and who signed an extension with the Mavs on Tuesday.\n\nIt all happened so fast, Irving and the Mavericks coming together out of need last February, and the success has evolved even quicker than the most rosy, blue-eyed optimist could've envisioned.\n\nThe Mavericks have enabled Irving to be his best self on the floor, and he's evolved into a leader on a team with many young pieces.\n\n\"It was such a quick process, man,\" Irving told Yahoo Sports recently. \"I was in West Orange High School in New Jersey working on my game and trying to figure out what this trade would lead me to, to getting a call from Dallas and, in a blink of an eye, here I am in L.A. playing the Clippers the next night.\"\n\nIrving needed a fresh start after the once-promising Brooklyn Nets situation turned toxic. The Mavericks needed to restore confidence with franchise star Luka Don\u010di\u0107 following departures of key running mates.\n\nIn a way, the respective mistakes of both parties led them to each other, and it's paid off.\n\n\"It really wasn't about the past, it was about our past,\" Harrison told Yahoo Sports. \"And leaning on that. I know the person you are, your character.\"\n\nSo Dallas sent out Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a future first-round pick and two seconds for Irving and Markieff Morris -- a trade that looks like high thievery in hindsight, given how well Irving has fit in his first full season next to Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nIrving could've very well been out of the NBA, his reputation in tatters following a tweet of an antisemitic film that garnered weeks of controversy, an indefinite team suspension, demands from the Anti-Defamation League and condemnation all around the league.\n\nHe deleted the tweet, issued an apology but the damage was done.\n\nHis spellbinding talent and his relationship with Harrison produced this chance.\n\nThe Western Conference was too full of talent, and the Mavericks couldn't risk passing up the opportunity to give Don\u010di\u0107 true help; it would've started a clock on some inevitable trade demand, some believe.\n\n\"It depends on what you already have. Some teams need big moves,\" Harrison said. \"For us, when you have a young player who's ready to go, you have to pair him with as much talent. So that requires you to make a [big] move.\"\n\n\"Go get him. Get him,\" Mavericks coach Jason Kidd told Yahoo Sports of his conversation with Harrison about Irving. \"We need another star. We felt that he fit next to Luka, and he was able to get him.\"\n\nKidd had been traded multiple times through his career and knew the rejuvenating effect it could have with someone like Irving -- and he felt the Mavericks were perfectly positioned to cultivate the right environment to bring out the best in him.\n\n\"Yeah, we believe that we have the people power to turn that around. Nico and myself as being the head of that,\" Kidd said. \"Because we knew Kai ... and it all worked out. I mean, Kai participated at a high level. But you can see he's having fun. The joy of basketball is at a high. But the trust that he has in Niko and myself is at a high too, and I think we were honest with him and he was honest with us.\"\n\nThat first in-depth conversation Kidd and Irving had was simple.\n\n\"I wasn't judging him on any of whatever was going on. I was looking at him as the man that he is when he walks in the office,\" Kidd said. \"And so, whatever was going on in the past was the past. And so for me, it was just a matter of, 'How do we help you get to the next level? Or get back to having fun playing basketball?' We talked about that.\"\n\nHarrison isn't surprised about Irving's evolution as a leader, attributing it to age and experience.\n\n\"The thing about Kyrie: He's always been very introspective and thoughtful,\" Harrison said. \"So when you think about what qualities make a good leader, he's always had them. He's hard working, he cares about other people. So he's always been a leader. He's just taken it to another level. He's at that age in his life where it's most important.\"\n\nIrving showed enough to get the Mavericks to commit to a three-year deal worth $120 million last summer (and reportedly tried to recruit LeBron James to Dallas), and although he wasn't an All-Star officially this season, his production has been sterling and his affect on winning has been palpable, with the Mavericks going 39-19 when Irving was available, compared to 11-13 when he was injured.\n\n\"This has been the greatest ... portion of my career,\" Irving said. \"To be able to now give wisdom and also speak from a place of experience. When you're a young person, again, you're trying to speed through life, you're trying to get through everything.\"\n\nHe tells his teammates that team goals are what matter now, and that this run to the Finals will be remembered forever.\n\n\"You know, people remember the greatest players of all time, and they argue all the time, but no one really talks about team aspect unless they're a true fan of the craft,\" Irving said. \"You talk about the Spurs, you gotta talk about dynasty. You talk about the Lakers, you got to talk about dynasty. You talk about the Celtics, you talk about dynasty. They literally took over eras, the Detroit Pistons, they defined an era.\"\n\nThe Irving who spoke in fortune-cookie riddles, the one who used to be mocked, is one who speaks with such clarity right now, urging his teammates to stay in the moment and not look ahead.\n\n\"You know, he's been able to teach us a lot about being poised,\" Mavericks rookie center Dereck Lively II told Yahoo Sports. \"A lot about the ins and outs of the game and also, the runs. You know, he can go on a 20-point run himself, but after that, you're gonna need some help.\"\n\nThere certainly appears to be an internal balance within the 32-year-old. Irving almost seems to come across as a gentle leader, at least with Lively II.\n\n\"I'm gonna make mistakes,\" Lively II said. \"But being able to try to move on, being able to go to the next play and be able to learn from it, definitely something I've learned from these two [Irving and Don\u010di\u0107]. You know, whenever I mess up sometimes, they're gonna yell at me a bit, but right after they're gonna tell me to keep going.\"\n\nTraditionally, Boston and its Garden have been a house of horrors for opponents for decades, with dead spots in the floor, hot water mysteriously going missing from visiting locker rooms and even fans dressing up in white sheets to simulate ghosts.\n\nThis Finals series, especially the first two games in Boston, will be a test for Irving's newfound peace. It's a reminder of his time as a Celtic and even a Cleveland Cavalier. It could be a reminder of any team he's played for, honestly -- the unfinished business, the hurt feelings.\n\n\"When we're growing up, we are very individualistic and very nearsighted in terms of what's in front of us as a young person. You see what's in front of you,\" Irving said. \"And I am a young person still, so I don't want to say like that. I'm still growing.\n\n\"I look at it as a journey. And people say that often, but they don't know what that actually means. It means when you enjoy the journey, it means that you've had an acceptance of what comes with this.\n\n\"I've been able to realize that my presence around the NBA brotherhood and WNBA sisterhood is different than who I am outside in the broader world. This is a part of it. But this isn't the whole thing.\"\n\nIt was supposed to be a whole lotta fun in Brooklyn, a very ambitious, very promising venture that could've resulted in at least one championship, pairing with Kevin Durant and, later, James Harden.\n\nIf Irving doesn't twist his ankle against the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round of the 2021 playoffs, the Nets would've been the heavy favorite to win that title. It hindered the start of the next season, too, and he never really got on track.\n\n\"If you have a hamstring or you have a knee soreness, people are looking at you like, 'But I would play,' and then you have former players saying that stuff as well, which leads to shorter careers at some capacity,\" Irving said. \"I'm coming off the most significant ankle injury I've ever had in my career, but no one sees that and then I am suspended indefinitely for the COVID vaccine and then now I'm not around the team fixing or healing my ankle.\"\n\nNew York's vaccine mandate put Irving at a disadvantage compared to players in other areas who weren't vaccinated. It was a scary time for many around the country and around the world. Irving became a symbol for so many things, and he couldn't even use basketball as an outlet.\n\n\"I can't rehab, I can't have anyone around me from the Brooklyn Nets helping me,\" Irving said. \"Again, not their fault It was the circumstances. [But] I'm figuring out, 'How do I maximize my potential?'\"\n\nIrving laughs at the memory of those 2021 playoffs, probably because it feels so long ago. But so much had happened between then and now, the things that brought Irving, hopefully, to a place of growth.\n\n\"I think sometimes people still saw me as the young man coming into the league like as if I don't have other responsibilities and other things that matter to me,\" Irving said. \"So I think that's been part of the evolution of just helping people realize that I'm matured.\"\n\nHe's a father to three and a husband. His stepmother, Shetellia Riley Irving, and wife, Marlene Wilkerson, sat nearby during the Western Conference finals during the road games in Minneapolis.\n\n\"This is a supportive environment, and there's a lot of energy positivity, then this is where I thrive and this is good, fun, good-hearted people,\" Irving said. \"Not saying I didn't have that in Brooklyn, I was just saying that it's all about organizational structure, and it's all about how you treat your veterans. It's all about how you treat your star players. It's all about how you treat people with respect.\"\n\nHe's careful when referencing the Brooklyn experience, similar to how he described playing in Boston in the 2022 playoffs during his media session Monday.\n\n\"Everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s*** a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level,\" he said. \"It wasn't a great reflection on my end towards the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment, no matter what people are yelling at you.\"\n\nHe's careful now, because he was often reckless then. Irving is in the moment now, and depending on when one was introduced to Irving, an opinion can sway in one of a million directions.\n\nIrving is still someone who pays attention, still figuring out how to be a basketball player and a citizen.\n\n\"So I tried to give basketball answers and the basketball answers are media-trained answers. So they're very safe,\" Irving told Yahoo Sports. \"They're very political. They're very middle ground. They're very gray area because you're taught not to give personal information.\n\n\"But I think what has happened over the past few years is people thought my priorities were going to this thing over here, this thing over here, and now I'm lending my voice [to causes]. It's like, no this is something that I've been called to do since I was a kid. It was before the NBA.\"\n\nHe points out the \"business\" of the NBA is very lucrative, while also being very young at 77 years old -- he's got living grandparents older than the league, he said.\n\nIrving believes his absence from the NBA's grandest stage will lead to him savoring every moment, perhaps quieting a Boston Garden crowd for a night or two, perhaps making him a champion twice over.\n\n\"Like, because when you're in it, and you're in it, and you're, like, I want to enjoy it. You don't know how because you're thinking about beyond,\" Irving said. \"You get kicked out of the playoffs in April last year. I had to live with that the whole summer. And it's not too often you're back [in the Finals] after seven years.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Like Bryant's millions of fans, Dallas Mavericks star Kyrie Irving continues to feel his presence in spirit and is deeply grateful for the lessons he learned from the Lakers legend. Irving recently shared his grief over losing Bryant, whom he regarded as his mentor.\n\n\"I don't know if anyone here has ever lost a mentor. Even if you guys didn't talk everyday, there was still that connection that they were gonna always be there for you. I miss [Kobe Bryant] every single day,\" Irving said.\n\nThroughout his career, Irving built a deep relationship with Bryant that exceeded the typical teacher-student dynamic. In his recent take, Irving then shared the influence Bryant had on his career and how he approached the game of basketball.\n\n\"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear. I had that type of mentorship and relationship with him where I was able to ask him almost anything. He was just easy to approach with those type of questions about what goes on day in and day out, chasing something that's bigger than yourself,\" Irving added.\n\nLike Bryant, Irving has numerous young players who draw inspiration from his exceptional skills. As a mentor, Irving aims to honor Kobe's legacy by serving as a guiding figure for the young stars.\n\nKyrie Irving has long idolized Kobe Bryant. Now, has the opportunity to honor his legacy as the ultimate Bryant admirer. Bryant's last championship victory, achieved by defeating the Boston Celtics, was driven by his quest for revenge and redemption.\n\n\"The last one is always the most special to me because it was the hardest to get, playing our rival, the Celtics. And you know, them having beat us in 2008, it was a kind of redemption,\" Kobe said.\n\nNow, as the Dallas Mavericks prepare to face the Celtics in the NBA Finals, Irving can draw motivation from his mentor's words and strive to emulate Bryant's triumph. Just as Bryant used past defeats to fuel his determination, Irving can channel that same spirit to secure a championship victory for the Mavericks .", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shabiha_akter@totalprosports.com", "name": "Shabiha Akter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Educational_Resources/Mentoring_Programs", "label": "dmoz/Science/Educational Resources/Mentoring Programs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-514745850-scaled-e1717473333587.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

When Irving joined Boston as a baby-faced 26-year-old, the fit was, to put it mildly, not ideal. After two disappointing years, he left town for the Brooklyn Nets. In Boston, he feuded with teammates and joined the long list of athletes who called out the city's racism. When Irving returned to Boston, a fan threw a water bottle at him. Irving also gave the Celtic faithful the one-finger salute and stomped on the head of their leprechaun mascot painted at half-court.\n\nThis won him no friends in the press, who accused Irving of being what they call \"a locker-room cancer.\" Irving's time in Brooklyn -- alongside future Hall-of-Famers James Harden and Kevin Durant -- only seemed to cement this reputation when a Nets club with championship-or-bust aspirations became the sports equivalent of box-office poison. There were injuries, chemistry problems, and a toxic atmosphere that made, for all the talent and expense, an unwatchable result. (Call them Kevin's Gate.)\n\nDuring the pandemic, Irving earned broad disapproval -- and the love of Ted Cruz -- for refusing to take the vaccine. This also disrupted the franchise, as state law prevented him from playing games in New York City.\n\nToday, Irving is 32, and is, in his own words, a different human being. It's a sentiment seemingly universally agreed upon across the media landscape. The press accepts that Irving has changed for the better not because of his conversion to Islam or new family life but because the Mavericks are winning, and in this moral ecosystem, the proof of not just greatness but goodness is found only in wins and losses.\n\nFar from the Tasmanian Devil of chaos he has been accused of being throughout his career, Irving is now a locker-room leader: the calm, elder sage on an inexperienced team whose core -- including wunderkind Luka Doncic -- is all of 25 years or younger. It has been especially great theater to see the prickly Doncic take to Irving like a long-lost basketball blood brother. Their energy and chemistry on and off the court is like a buddy flick from the 1980s: The cocksure Slovenian kid and a grizzled vet from New Jersey, after a wary beginning, become besotted with each other. Then they join forces to topple an evil empire of emerald green. The script writes itself.\n\nBut Irving's metamorphosis is seen most strikingly in his relationship with the sports media. It has been stunning to watch him go from being hostile and distrustful of the press to thoughtful and gregarious. He now looks from the podium at a sea of ink-stained wretches and makes them sing his tune. They celebrate his character off the court, while belatedly recognizing his Hall of Fame skills on the court -- skills that recently provoked his former teammate LeBron James to call him \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nIrving's newfound love affair with the media is not why people are taken with him; it's the effect. The cause is that he is no longer blithe about his own cultural power. Irving realizes that if he says -- even in jest -- that the earth is flat or if he retweets, apparently without having watched it, an antisemitic video, this not only distracts a whole team; it creates an image of him as some kind of villain that is at odds with reality. That negative perception was always a shame, because the common thread throughout Irving's tumultuous career is that he gives a damn about the world. He stood with the Black Lives Matter movement almost a decade ago, after the 2014 police killing of Eric Garner, when he wore an \"I Can't Breathe\" shirt to warm-ups. He embraced his Indigenous heritage and the struggle at Standing Rock. He has always been in solidarity with the people of Palestine. Irving's mistake was thinking that his ongoing actions would define his character, when in our ravenous world of sports social media, a wrongheaded click can matter more than a decade of good work.\n\nKyrie Irving is in many respects still the same Kyrie, but he now sees his own power as a personality. He realizes that if he wants people to care about Black lives or Standing Rock or Palestine, how he presents those ideas are as important as how he presents himself. It's the oldest story in sports media: either give the 24-hour news cycle something to feed upon, or they will feed on you. Irving is clearly worn out from being fed upon. He is wise enough in his 32-year-old dotage to know that if he gives of himself to the press, they will run with the narrative that this is a \"new Kyrie\" and will burnish his image for him.\n\nThere is nothing the media loves more than a comeback. Now, he is someone who takes a keffiyeh to press conferences and wears a Palestine-shaped pendant, yet by the time the interviews end, the hard-bitten scribes come out singing his praises. It is a dizzying feat, and it signals the greatest change in Irving: going from someone who was being played by the media -- held up unfairly as a symbol for all that's wrong with sports -- to someone who now expertly plays them. Irving has always deserved his due. To see him get it is to see the inverse of a depressing truism: Irving could have left the NBA a villain, but he has lived long enough to become a hero.", "source": {"uri": "thenation.com",

Leave him alone. You're not the ones that have to go between those lines and actually guard this man.\"\n\nPerkins makes a fair point, as he also referenced a story where a fan heckled LeBron James and the coach told

Irving, of course, hit one of the greatest shots in NBA history back in 2016 as he and current Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James lifted the Cleveland Cavaliers to their first ever NBA Championship.\n\nThere are some who feel that Irving was the best fit as LeBron's running mate. The Lakers star recently spoke on the talented point guard, saying how he is mad he's no longer his teammate and calling Irving the most gifted basketball player he has ever seen.\n\nAs Irving took the podium prior to the NBA Finals getting set to begin, he was of course asked about LeBron's comments and was appreciative of everything his former teammate had to say, while also acknowledging his ability to get the media turned up, via NBA:\n\n\"Great reaction. It's appreciated, it's a lot of gratitude there as well. Obviously I'm at a different age and place in my life. So is he and I think we've both been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish. Think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man and be comfortable and stand on my square and my beliefs and where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship is different because of that now.\n\n\"Definitely miss him. Playing out there, just making things easier being able to run up and down the floor and just throw the ball to somebody like that, throw it in the air just as athletic as they come. But just the mutual respect for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style I think it meshed very well and I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life. When he says comments like that I just think back to just us having those moments where we're down in a series or up in a series and we're really demanding greatness from each other. And then off the court our families just meshing well.\n\n\"Definitely think about those times, but now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect, but also now I'm at this stage and able to use some of the formulas that I was taught from him and some of the great teachers that have come before me. I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game. So shoutout to Bron for all that. He knows how to stir up a media storm and get everybody in here talking about us. But I'm looking forward to the future and getting this series started now.\"\n\nAs Irving noted, both he and LeBron are at different stages of their lives now and are able to better reflect on what they accomplished together. He admitted that there were some things that hurt their relationship at that time, but things are different now and he is grateful for what he learned from his former teammate.\n\nIn some ways, this is similar to the relationship between Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, who infamously had issues during their time with the Lakers together. But as time went on, they grew a much greater appreciation for just how great each was individually and as a duo.\n\nFor now, Kyrie is focused on the NBA Finals and winning his second NBA Championship and LeBron will undoubtedly be rooting for his former teammate to accomplish that goal.\n\nThough LeBron James is likely pulling for his former teammate, he still has respect for Kyrie Irving and the Mavericks' opponent in the NBA Finals, the Boston Celtics. Celtics star Jaylen Brown took home the Eastern Conference Finals MVP and, even though the Lakers-Celtics rivalry remains strong, LeBron still felt it necessary to shout out the young star.\n\nJames took to social media, giving respect to Brown for his accomplishment, one well deserved and in the midst of him not making an All-NBA team which many felt he deserved. The Lakers star told Brown to 'keep going' while also calling him a young king.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_hansford@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Corey Hansford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kyrei-Irving-LeBron-James.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Don't overthink it.\n\n\"Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball. The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nIndeed, if the Mavericks manage to reel off the upset and defeat the Celtics in the NBA Finals, plenty of it will fall on Irving and teammate Luka Doncic and their ability to carve up defenses.\n\nAt 32 years old, Irving is still one of the most gifted ball handlers and pure scorers to ever play the game.\n\n\"Pray,\" Jrue Holiday said of the approach when it comes to slowing down Irving. \"I think it's just familiarity. Just, I think, knowing each other's game, doing your best to stay in front of him, trying to take away the things that will probably hurt you the most.\n\n\"Probably most of all having help. Him being able to see multiple guys on the court, making it look like it's crowded, making shots as tough as possible, even though he's a tough shot-maker.\"\n\nEven though Irving's tenure with Boston ended in disaster, the future Hall of Famer acknowledged that he's excited to face off against several of his former Celtics teammates -- with their growth fueling Boston's second run to the Finals in three seasons.\n\n\"I'm excited. They've gotten tremendously better,\" Irving said of Boston's current core of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. \"They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\n\nThey have a great team over there, led by a great coach. So we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough series. They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_ryan@boston.com", "name": "Conor Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TB6ISGJOZSO2VQPEMYVGJ4MJDE-6660c3848af65-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Oh, God, I love it. Got to love this, man.\n\n\"Shout out to LeBron for that. (He) knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us.\"\n\nIrving said he has a \"great reaction\" to the comments made by James, and that \"it's appreciated\" what the Los Angeles Laker superstar had to say.\n\n\"There's a lot of gratitude there, as well,\" Irving said. \"Obviously, I'm in a different age, different place in my life. So is he. I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish.\n\n\"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now. (I) definitely miss him.\"\n\nWith Irving and James at the controls, the Cavs advanced to the NBA Finals in 2015, '16 and '17. All three of those Finals appearances came against Golden State, with Irving drilling the series-clinching jumper on the road in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals against the Warriors.\n\n\"I definitely think about those times,\" Irving said. \"Yeah, just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life.\"\n\nOn his podcast, James also said: \"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card, it's like having a Draw 4 in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno.\"\n\nIrving was taken aback by those remarks from James.\n\n\"Man, when he says comments like that, I think back to us having those moments where we're down in a series, up in a series, we're really demanding greatness from each other,\" Irving said. \"Off the court, our families meshing well.\"\n\nPORZINGIS HAS LOVE FOR MAVS: Boston Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis admitted Wednesday that he has some very fond memories of his time playing for the Mavs.\n\n\"Not all of it was, like, not good, right?,\" Porzingis rhetorically asked. \"We had some good moments. We had some decent moments. Yeah, overall, I think it didn't work for both sides. It wasn't perfect.\n\n\"But, like I would say everything -- teammates, locker room -- I know at that time there were some rumors there's like something in the locker room. It was never like that. It's all just noise at the end.\"\n\nPorzingis said he's always had a good relationship with Mavs point guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107, and Don\u010di\u0107 also said the same thing.\n\n\"As I said, he's one of the best players in the league, in the world,\" Porzingis said. \"It will be a tough challenge for us to try to stop him. Just following his career when he came in the league, already made a huge impact.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to play with him for a couple years, get to know him. Just knowing what type of person he is, what type of player he is, his mindset, he's a special player. We have a big challenge ahead of us competing against somebody like that.\"\n\nPorzingis, who was expected to a co-star to Don\u010di\u0107, played for the Mavs from Jan. 31, 2019 until they traded him to the Washington Wizards on Feb. 10, 2022. He originally came to the Mavs from New York in a deal which also include the No. 24 overall pick going to the Knicks in this year's NBA Draft.\n\n\"It wasn't just perfect for us playing together,\" Porzingis said. \"It didn't work out, that's it. We moved on. There's no, like, ill-will from their side, for sure from my side. I don't think there should be.\n\n\"(It) just didn't work out. But I have nothing but love for Dallas and for the teammates and for everybody there.\"\n\nEMBRACE THE FINALS, AND ENJOY IT: Mavs coach Jason Kidd said when he was playing for New Jersey, and the Nets got swept, 4-0, in the 2002 NBA Finals by a Los Angeles Lakers squad led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, in retrospect it's easy for him to analyze exactly what happened.\n\n\"Sometimes you don't have enough talent,\" Kidd said. \"As I brought up the Lakers and Nets, we were happy to be there, but we just didn't have enough talent to beat Kobe and Shaq. It could be that simple. But nerves sometimes play a part, too. Just the human side of things.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, as much as we've talked about it, to embrace it, to stay steady, and to enjoy this time because you're not promised anything to come back the following year. We have an opportunity here to find a way to win on the road. That's how we're approaching it. That's what the Finals are all about is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nBRIEFLY: The NBA has released the names of the 12 referees who will officiate this year's NBA Finals. Here's the list with, in parathesis, how many different years the referee has officiated in the NBA Finals. They are: Tony Brothers (13), James Capers (12), Marc Davis (13), Scott Foster (17), John Goble (8), David Guthrie (7), Bill Kennedy (6), Courtney Kirkland (4), Kevin Scott (2), Josh Tiven (5), James Williams (4) and Zach Zarba (11). Foster has officiated 24 NBA Finals games, followed by Davis with 20 and Brothers with 16. Tyler Ford and Ben Taylor have been assigned as alternate referees for the NBA Finals. . .Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis has been cleared to play in Game 1. But he said it's tough to say if he'll be ready, because he hasn't played since April 29 when he strained\" his right calf which he injured in Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat. \"Tomorrow will be my real, like, first real minutes in a while, you know, Porzingis said. \"I did as much as I could to prepare for this moment, but there's nothing like game minutes and game experience that I'm going to get tomorrow. It will be tough to jump into the Finals like this. I did everything I could to prepare for it and we'll see tomorrow night.\". .Center Daniel Gafford, when asked what type of advantage the Mavs have in this best-of-seven series against the Celtics, said: \"Just coming out, setting the tone. We got a lot of energy around this team. We got a great atmosphere around this team. If we come out with our heads on straight, I feel like it's going to be a pretty good situation.\". .The Boston Celtics lost to the Golden State Warriors in the 2022 NBA Finals, and they also lost to the Miami Heat in last year's Eastern Conference Finals. This year, the Celtics came roaring back and won the East with a 64-18 record, and were the only NBA team to win 60-plus games this season. \"I think you can see in our excitement when we won the conference,\" Celtics forward Jayson Tatum said. \"Obviously, that's not the end all, be all, but it really is tough to get to this moment. I think right now just staying present in the moment. I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that. Just excited to play some basketball after this long break and go out there and try to get the job done.\". .Guillermo Rodriguez, the sidekick on the Jimmy Kimmel Show, was among the several hundred media folks who attended Wednesday's Media Day. Rodriguez did several skits with players from both teams, which will be seen on Kimmel's show on Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. on ABC. . .To say that Mavs second-year guard Jaden Hardy is ready for Game 1 to start would be the understatement of the day. \"This experience is amazing,\" Hardy said. \"I look at it as a blessing. A lot of people play their careers and never get a chance to play in the Finals. I would never take this for granted. I'm just super grateful to be here. Can't wait to get started.\". .Game 1 of the NBA Finals is Thursday at 7:30 p.m. from Boston's TD Garden.", "source": {"uri": "mavs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Official Home of the Dallas

He will need to keep his emotions in check if he wants to navigate the upcoming games at the TD Garden because the crowd will be loud and proud as they look to cheer their team to victory.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3UAVYRg\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3y0H4Lh\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nReport: Porzingis expected to play in Game 1 of NBA Finals Doris Burke, JJ Redick on Mavericks historic backcourt, how the Celtics Stock Exchange match up Boston Celtics almost swapped Kyrie Irving for Kristaps Porzingis in 2019", "source": {"uri": "celticswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celtics Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doris Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://celticswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2022/04/USATSI_18153894.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

It was February 2023, and the mere idea of those superstars sharing the court for the Dallas Mavericks seemed disastrous.\n\nIrving was a persona non grata in the NBA world after a disappointing 3 1/2-season stint in Brooklyn, in which his team never advanced past the second round of the playoffs and his name was constantly mired in controversy. And Doncic was looked at as someone who complained too much and didn't know how to command a team.\n\nBut the Mavericks decided to gamble, with coach Jason Kidd believing he could bring those personalities together.\n\n\"You have to give credit to J Kidd because at this time Kyrie was seen as someone you shouldn't touch,\" Mavericks assistant coach Jared Dudley told FOX Sports. \"Luka was, 'Hey, does he have enough leadership skills? Can you play for Luka?'\"\n\nWhen the Mavericks pulled the trigger on the deal, the NBA world cringed.\n\nESPN gave Dallas a D grade for the trade. And as recently as February, a Deadspin article called for general manager Nico Harrison and Kidd to be fired, arguing, \"No team in recent memory has failed to build around a generational superstar more than the Dallas Mavericks have with Luka Doncic.\"\n\nOnly now, the Mavericks are about to make their third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history, and are widely being hailed for having one of the greatest backcourts of all-time.\n\nThe road to this moment has been far from smooth.\n\nThe Mavericks missed the playoffs last season, as the injury-plagued duo of Irving and Doncic went 5-11 in games they both played. At the time, it seemed the Mavericks had proven their detractors right, with the trade being a bust.\n\nBut the team's front office still believed this would work, and made re-signing Irving to a three-year, $120 million deal their No. 1 priority last offseason. It has paid off now. But, at the time, did they ever think of going another direction? Did they consider pushing the panic button?\n\n\"No, that was far from the truth,\" Kidd told FOX Sports. \"We're judged on wins and losses. That's fair. We were coming down the stretch and we weren't making the game-winner or the game-tying shot. I think that helped the relationship on the floor because of the struggle. It's alright to fail.\"\n\nIn the NBA, with teams spending hundreds of millions of dollars on player salaries, there's often a very short runway for failure. The mantra is often win now or bust. Not learn from your mistakes and improve.\n\nBut the Mavericks deeply believed in a Doncic and Irving pairing.\n\nAnd over the last eight months, things dramatically changed for them. Their trust blossomed, especially during preseason trips, eventually growing into a symbiotic relationship that has led to fireworks on the court. The team added the right pieces around those superstars. And now, the Mavericks are competing for their first title since 2011.\n\nFor Kidd, it's a testament to the team's belief in itself.\n\n\"I think sometimes we think, when we fail, it doesn't work,\" Kidd told FOX Sports. \"We don't give it enough time. With Nico and those guys giving it enough time, we're here.\"\n\n***\n\nNo one knew what to expect when Irving arrived in Dallas.\n\nDudley was initially assigned to be \"his guy.\" They'd watch film. Dudley would show up at the arena 3 1/2 hours early to go through Irving's pre-game drills. He was the person who was supposed to get the superstar oriented.\n\nDudley acknowledged he was unsure how it would all go.\n\n\"When is the real Kyrie going to show up after all the stuff you hear?\" Dudley wondered. \"But it never came. He seems like he's at peace.\"\n\nIrving was quiet at first. The past few seasons had taken a toll on him. The Nets' Big Three -- Irving, Kevin Durant and James Harden -- who were expected to dominate the league, had greatly underperformed. And Irving was often entrenched in drama, including being heavily criticized for missing games because he declined to get vaccinated, and then posting a link on Twitter to an antisemitic film.\n\nWhen Irving demanded a trade from Brooklyn, it was clear he needed a new start. With the Mavericks, there was an immediate sense of comfort.\n\nIrving had a pre-existing relationship with Harrison, who used to work as an executive for Nike and had known Irving since he was in high school. And Irving had long looked up to Kidd, who was the team's point guard when the Mavericks last won a championship.\n\nIrving began opening up and becoming much more talkative.\n\n\"When a person is at peace, they can perform at their highest ability,\" Dudley told FOX Sports. \"Kyrie is, 'Don't lie to me and just keep it real with me.' I feel that knowing that information, some of these organizations must not have [done that].\"\n\nFor the Mavericks, Irving has been the antithesis of a lightning rod for drama. He has kept a low profile, only making headlines for his play. The Mavericks believed he could thrive here as soon as he developed chemistry with Doncic.\n\nThat hope materialized ahead of the season when they traveled to Abu Dhabi and Madrid in October for a few exhibition games.\n\nDoncic views Madrid as his second home after leading Real Madrid to the 2018 EuroLeague title as a teenager, and he embraced the opportunity to show his superstar teammate the country that helped form who he is today. They got meals together. Irving even apparently DJ'd at a party Doncic hosted. They both brought their families, and got to know each other as men off the court.\n\nIt led to a newfound chemistry that was palpable to everyone around them.\n\n\"I thought the Abu Dhabi and Madrid trip really helped those two get to know each other better off the floor,\" Kidd told FOX Sports. \"I think sometimes we always look at on the floor first. But I think off the floor, for them to spend that time together was big.\"\n\nThat trust grew throughout the season. And when the Mavericks traded for Daniel Gafford and P.J. Washington in February, and then made them and Derrick Jones Jr. starters to add an infusion of defense and a veteran presence in that lineup, the Mavericks began to soar. They won 16 of their final 18 games before Doncic and Irving rested the final two contests of the season. Now, the offensive wizards were surrounded by a stalwart defense, which climbed from No. 23 in the league to No. 1 as of March 7.\n\nIrving and Doncic's on-court magic was especially visible during their win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference finals.\n\nWhen Doncic was hampered by knee and ankle injuries in Game 2, Irving offered to take over point guard duties. And when Doncic's offensive game was bottled up in the fourth quarter, Irving tried to unscrew the pressure cooker, telling him he'd take over that burden. (Irving carried the team with 13 points over that period, while Doncic had five.)\n\nIt allowed Doncic to be ready when it counted most, with him making the game-winning 3-pointer with 3.5 seconds left over Rudy Gobert's outstretched arms.\n\nIt's clear that Irving has evolved into the leader that Doncic needed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team. But he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals [alongside LeBron James in Cleveland in 2016]. He's the one that is really leading it. He's keeping us all together and motivated.\"\n\nIn many ways, Irving understands Doncic and the pressure he faces. He closely witnessed something similar when he was teammates with James, who has long been the face of the league. Doncic is widely pegged as being next to wear that crown. And Irving wants to help teach him things he learned from witnessing how James managed the crushing expectations.\n\n\"I played with one of the greatest of all time, arguably the greatest of all time, up there with the top three, top four, and [he] dealt with a lot of that criticism and pressure, shielding us from it as teammates,\" Irving said. \"I think you see the same things happen and occur with the greatest players that play. They take on a lot of pressure, and they love it, and they relish in it, and they love answering that call. For me, I just want to be supportive and continue to be an all-time great next to [Doncic]. And continue to show him the ropes, letting him fly.\"\n\nDoncic credits Irving for helping him mature and see the game differently. But, in many ways, Irving gained Doncic's trust more than anyone could have anticipated.\n\n\"I think he respects him at the highest level and I think it's hard for Luka to respect people,\" Dudley told FOX Sports. \"I think he respects his craft and I think he respects how he goes about his craft, coming in three hours before, his crazy layups, what he has to endure and what he has accomplished. I think he respects him at the highest level. And you have to do a lot for Luka to respect your basketball game.\"\n\n***\n\nKidd is grateful that the Mavericks held the rope instead of making a rash decision when it appeared the Irving experiment was doomed last season.\n\nHe knows that doesn't always happen in the league. In fact, he has some \"what ifs\" from his playing days, especially during his first stint with this very franchise.\n\nBack when Kidd was in his early 20s, he infused the city of Dallas with some thrilling basketball, alongside Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn, who were known as the \"Three J's.\" But because of injuries and immaturity, they were quickly broken up. When asked if they could've won a championship if they had pushed through their drama, Kidd didn't hesitate.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

We were 21, so we were like Oklahoma City. We were just babies in a league that was much older. It was a man's game. It still is a man's game, but we were playing against 30-year-olds. We were young. We didn't know how to win. And it's a difference in college to the NBA. You could be down 15 or up 15 with six minutes left, and the score can be flipped on you just because of understanding what it takes to win in this league.\"\n\nFor Kidd, his first championship didn't come until much later in his career, after he returned to Dallas in February 2008, joining forces with Dirk Nowitzki. In fact, he said he sees some similarities in the way they approached their partnership with the way the team's current stars have done so.\n\n\"Dirk and I spent a lot of time having dinner on the road to get to know each other,\" Kidd told FOX Sports. \"He's a good dude on and off the floor. I think these two [Irving and Doncic] got to see that about each other.\"\n\nNow, Kidd will have an opportunity that eluded him in the past: Winning his second title with the Mavericks.\n\nHe's just glad his initial hunch paid off. And he hopes he can lead this iteration of the Mavericks across the finish line.\n\nAfter all, he knows how rare it is for two of the league's biggest superstars to thrive alongside one another. So, his goal is simple.\n\n\"To embrace it, to stay steady, and to enjoy this time because you're not promised anything to come back the following year,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com",

The fanfare between the two sides was gone long before the dude decided to leave. But once he did that? It was certainly over.\n\nYou rarely see a fanbase make such a turn against a player while also having that player simultaneously return some of that ire, but that's definitely the case here. Irving doesn't like Boston and Boston doesn't like him either.\n\nBut what did Irving do to make Celtics fans so mad at him? There's quite a list of things that turned the relationship there inside out.\n\nLet's go over some of them.\n\nIrving told Celtics fans he would stay and then didn't\n\nThis is at the crux of it all. Irving told Celtics fans that he'd re-sign with the team. Then he didn't.\n\nHe also destroyed the team's chemistry on his way out the door. The Celtics were still good, but it obviously took years to get the vibes back to where they needed to be.\n\nThere were some not-so-fun times in Boston after Irving left.\n\nHe burned sage in TD Garden\n\nOk, so this one is a bit complicated. Irving burned some sage in TD Garden ahead of a Nets game back at the arena to \"cleanse the energy\" of the arena, which Celtics fans definitely took offense to.\n\nThat's not necessarily a slight -- burning sage is a key part of Indigenous culture. Typically, it's done to cleanse and purge negative energies in one's own home, which is why it's hilarious that Irving did it at the Celtics' arena.\n\nNot going to lie -- this one was pretty funny. People had a ton of fun with it back then.\n\nIrving stomped the Celtics' logo\n\nNow, with this one, it's kind of hard to be upset at Irving here. He stomped the Celtics' logo after a playoff game at TD Garden with the Nets back in 2021.\n\nTo be fair to Kyrie, not long after this a fan was arrested and banned for life from TD Garden after throwing a bottle at Irving and his Nets teammates. That logo stomp felt kind of deserved after that.\n\nIrving called the Celtics a \"scorned girlfriend\"\n\nThis one was definitely rude. He was asked about the boos he receives from Celtics fans at TD Garden. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"I know it's going to be like that for the rest of my career coming in here.

Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports / Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn a teaser for Episode 9 of \"Mind The Game\" and just two days prior to Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks, LeBron James has made his feelings toward a prematurely-ended on-court partnership with Kyrie Irving clear.\n\nJust like the majority of Cleveland Cavaliers fans who watched the duo dominate for the mid-2010s in Finals appearance after Finals appearance for four straight years, it appears LeBron is feeling nostalgic seeing Irving get back to the big stage for the first time since 2017.\n\n\"Sitting here watching it, I'm playing like so f***ing happy and so proud, and to watch him continue his growth or whatever the case may be. And at the same time, I'm so f***ing mad that I am not his running mate anymore.

There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do.\"\n\nLeBron went on to express his feelings, likening Irving's \"wildcard\" to Luka Doncic and the Mavs to a Draw 4 card in Uno.\n\n\"I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with absolutely none,\" LeBron continued. \"He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\n\n\"I've never seen a guy in my NBA life that feels better at times shooting with his off hand than his primary hand. If Kyrie's off in a game with his right hand, he will literally go exclusively to his left hand.

The cheapest ticket costs $793 dollars.\n\nAttending an NBA Finals game in person is a once-in-a-lifetime-like experience. Fans can witness firsthand some of the most clutch and famous moments in NBA history. For example, fans who saw LeBron James'chase-down block on Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 finals can say \"I was there!\" That moment will be forever etched in basketball history.\n\nChampionship ticket prices are always a big talking point during any sport's playoffs. This season, fans will dig deep into their pockets to attend an NBA Finals game between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe cheapest tickets are $793, for Game 1 in Boston.\n\nThere is a steady growth in price until a potential Game 6 when the cheapest ticket increases by $597 to $1,827.

They can create their shot at any moment. Don\u010di\u0107's signature stepback three proved lethal against the Minnesota Timberwolves, the best defensive team in the league this campaign. Irving has reached deep into his bag of tricks this postseason, weaving his way into the opponent's paint and finishing tough looks at the rim.\n\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving 2024 Playoff Stats\n\nCategory\n\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107\n\nKyrie Irving\n\nPPG\n\n28.8\n\n22.8\n\nAPG\n\n8.8\n\n5.2\n\n3PM\n\n3.4\n\n2.6\n\n3PT%\n\n34.3\n\n42.1\n\nMPG\n\n41.5\n\n40.2\n\nHowever, if any team can slow down the Mavericks' star guards, Boston is at the top of that list. Jrue Holiday and Derrick White form an elite defensive duo on the perimeter. Their screen navigation skills make it difficult for opposing guards to generate enough space to get downhill or shoot off the dribble.\n\nWhile most of Dallas' scoring comes from its backcourt, the Celtics' offense stems from Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown on the wing. Both forwards had an exceptional series against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals. Tatum averaged 30.3 points in the four-game sweep, and Brown scored 29.8 points per game. Derrick Jones Jr. is a capable wing defender for Dallas, but he cannot guard both of the Celtics' wings simultaneously.\n\nIrving returns to Boston with a championship on the line after leaving the Celtics on a sour note in 2019.

Kyrie Irving's resurgence in form has been key to the Mavericks' playoff success so far. Irving, after enduring tumultuous stints since leaving the Cavaliers, has found a home and a new lease of life with the Mavericks.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks are currently preparing to take on the Boston Celtics in the 2023-24 NBA Finals, having navigated their way as the fifth seed in the Western Conference.\n\nWhile five-time All-Star Luka Don\u010di\u0107 has earned many of the plaudits for the Mavericks' success over the course of the post-season, Kyrie Irving has not taken a backseat, and league insider Mark Medina suggests that winning a championship would be the pinnacle of his 'huge redemption arc', after a rocky time in the league since he departed the Cleveland Cavaliers back in 2017.\n\nMavericks Hoping To Make History Only the second team to reach NBA Finals as a fifth seed (Miami Heat, 2020)\n\nDallas somehow overcame some of the Western Conference's best-performing teams, eliminating the L.A. Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Minnesota Timberwolves on their way to the NBA Finals, with the Boston Celtics the final boss they have left to beat.\n\nIf they were to do so, they would become the first team to ever lift the Larry O'Brien trophy as a fifth-seed, while they are only the second team since the Miami Heat in the 2020 'bubble' season to even reach the Finals as a five-seed.\n\nA large part of their success in the post-season so far has been down to the improvements that Luka Don\u010di\u0107 has made since his early struggles, having been dealing with a knee injury since the latter stages of the 2023-24 regular season, and after his dominance in the Western Conference Finals, he appears to have entered a new level of stardom status as one of the NBA's best players.\n\nHe has been so impressive, that he has drawn perhaps the highest level of praise from his head coach, Jason Kidd, who stated that if he was to help the Mavericks win only their second title in franchise history, then he would eclipse - yes - the Hall-of-Famer, Dirk Nowitzki, as Dallas' \"greatest ever player\".\n\nDallas Mavericks - Efficiency by 2023-24 Playoff Series\n\nCategory\n\nvs. Clippers\n\nvs. Thunder\n\nvs. Timberwolves\n\nPTS\n\n107.0\n\n106.0\n\n111.4\n\nOPP PTS\n\n100.3\n\n106.0\n\n105.6\n\nORTG\n\n115.9\n\n112.0\n\n118.3\n\nDRTG\n\n109.5\n\n111.8\n\n112.1\n\nNRTG\n\n6.4\n\n0.2\n\n6.2\n\nBut, of course, basketball is a team sport, and he hasn't been able to do it alone, with the Mavericks' supporting cast being one of the most efficient throughout the playoffs, while he also has a superstar in his own right partnering him in the backcourt in eight-time All-Star, Kyrie Irving.\n\nWith Irving's veteran experience, gifted scoring and, at times, ludicrous ball handling - which saw his former teammate LeBron James dub him as a 'wizard' - his partnership with 25-year-old Don\u010di\u0107 has dramatically evolved over the course of their season-and-a-half together, with their 1A/1B pairing as seamless as Batman and Robin.\n\nWith Irving looking back to his best during his current tenure with the Mavericks, after tumultuous stints with both Dallas' Finals opponents, the Celtics, and the Brooklyn Nets, it comes as little surprise that the 32-year-old has stated this to be the 'greatest portion of his career' in the NBA.\n\nIrving Did 'Not Excel as a Leader' After Cavaliers Exit\n\nMedina argues that while Irving has always shown himself to be a great basketball player, things went 'off the rails' for him after his game 7 dagger to seal the Cleveland Cavaliers comeback from 3-1 down back in 2016, where he didn't show himself as a leader, nor did he show he was 'the guy'.\n\n\"It's a huge redemption arc, because, think about this - in 2016, he hit that key dagger shot in game 7 of the NBA finals to help Cleveland [Cavaliers] beat the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAnd ever since then, things have gone out off the rails. He did not want to play with LeBron in Cleveland anymore. He wanted to be able to stretch his wings, so to speak, and be the guy. And when he got that opportunity in Boston, he just did not excel as a leader. Same thing with Brooklyn.I think that the disappointing part is that no one's ever diminished the basketball piece. He's been a tremendous player, both with his talent and his ability to coexist with other teammates, but there's been two other problems. He hadn't been able to stay healthy consistently, and there were things within the team , or outside the team , that derailed his investment in the team .\"\n\nNew Lease of Life in Dallas 22.8 PPG in playoffs is best figure since 2016-17 season\n\nAfter leaving the Cavaliers in 2017, Irving had the vision of carving out his own team as the outright leader - gone from the fray of being in the shadows of LeBron James.\n\nBut, the reality is - he didn't fit the mold to be that number one option and leader in Boston, and then he opted to leave in favor of teaming up with Kevin Durant in Brooklyn, where James Harden followed suit shortly after.\n\nDespite averaging 25.6 points on 48.9 percent shooting, 4.6 rebounds and 6.0 assists during his stints with the Celtics and Nets, something didn't feel right about his fit, and so you could be forgiven for thinking that Irving's best years were behind him when he was traded to Dallas at the 2023 trade deadline, especially as they dropped out of playoff contention down the stretch of last-season.\n\nBut the 2023-24 campaign has acted as a source of resurgence for the 32-year-old, and while his scoring output in the regular season didn't exactly light up the top of the league's leaderboards, he still recorded 25.6 points on 49.7 percent shooting and 41.1 percent from three-point distance, while also offering solid contributions through his 5.2 assists, 5.0 rebounds, and 1.3 steals per game.\n\nKyrie Irving vs Luka Don\u010di\u0107 - 2023-24 Post-Season Comparison\n\nCategory\n\nKyrie Irving\n\nLuka

post-season, whereby he has been a consistent mainstay for the Mavericks behind Don\u010di\u0107, and has used his veteran experience to step up, both along with his co-star, and in co-star's absence, notching three 30-plus point outings in their series win over the Timberwolves in the last round.\n\nFurthermore, he is averaging 42.1 percent from distance, the second-most on the team this post-season, behind Maxi Kleber (50.0 percent), though he is attempting far more threes per game, 6.3 per outing, than his teammate, who is only averaging 2.8 long-range attempts per game.\n\nHaving a player who doesn't need to rely on his teammates to feed him the ball to score can also be hugely advantageous, especially in the playoffs where defensive intensity is expected to be higher.\n\nFor context, Boston has registered the third-best defense of all throughout the post-season with a rating of 108.7, while Dallas has recorded a 111.1 defensive efficiency.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Kyrie Irving has the best record in NBA history in closeout games (12-0).\n\nFortunately, Irving, through his crafty play, fits that mold perfectly, and throughout the playoffs has seen 64.8 percent of his total made field goals come unassisted, the second-most on the team behind - you guessed it - Don\u010di\u0107 (81.9 percent unassisted field goal makes).\n\nOn the defensive end of the ball, Irving hasn't been too shabby either, and when defending against All-Stars in the playoffs this season, he has held his opponents to only 36.1 percent field goal shooting.\n\nWith both of their leading superstars able to both score at will through their own shot creation, and possessing the ability to find their teammates often and be impactful on defense, they are a formidable duo that has proven to cause opposing defenses headaches throughout this historic run.\n\nWith an NBA championship at stake, the Mavericks will be hoping that they can exploit these unique skill-sets from both Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving to bring the title back home to Dallas, and if, hypothetically, they were to win it all, then Irving's redemption arc could well be considered complete.\n\nAll

Oh, God, I love it. Got to love this, man.\n\n\"Shout out to LeBron for that. (He) knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us.\"\n\nIrving said he has a \"great reaction\" to the comments made by James, and that \"it's appreciated\" what the Los Angeles Laker superstar had to say.\n\n\"There's a lot of gratitude there, as well,\" Irving said. \"Obviously, I'm in a different age, different place in my life. So is he. I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish.\n\n\"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now. (I) definitely miss him.\"\n\nWith Irving and James at the controls, the Cavs advanced to the NBA Finals in 2015, '16 and '17. All three of those Finals appearances came against Golden State, with Irving drilling the series-clinching jumper on the road in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.\n\n\"I definitely think about those times,\" Irving said. \"Yeah, just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life.\"\n\nOn his podcast, James also said: \"To have a guy like Kyrie Irving as the ultimate wild card, it's like having a Draw 4 in your hand every time someone deals you cards in Uno. He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\n\n\"He has the best gifts I've ever seen in any NBA player.\"\n\nIrving was taken aback by those remarks from James.\n\n\"Man, when he says comments like that, I think back to us having those moments where we're down in a series, up in a series, we're really demanding greatness from each other,\" Irving said.\n\nPORZINGIS HAS LOVE FOR MAVS: Boston Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis admitted Wednesday that he has some very fond memories of his time playing for the Mavs.\n\n\"Not all of it was, like, not good, right?,\" Porzingis rhetorically asked. \"We had some good moments. We had some decent moments. Yeah, overall, I think it didn't work for both sides. It wasn't perfect.\n\n\"But, like I would say everything -- teammates, locker room -- I know at that time there were some rumors there's like something in the locker room. It was never like that. It's all just noise at the end.\"\n\nPorzingis said he's always had a good relationship with Mavs point guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107, and Don\u010di\u0107 also said the same thing.\n\n\"As I said, he's one of the best players in the league, in the world,\" Porzingis said. \"It will be a tough challenge for us to try to stop him. Just following his career when he came in the league, already made a huge impact.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to play with him for a couple years, get to know him. Just knowing what type of person he is, what type of player he is, his mindset, he's a special player. We have a big challenge ahead of us competing against somebody like that.\"\n\nPorzingis, who was expected to be a co-star to Don\u010di\u0107, played for the Mavs from Jan. 31, 2019 until they traded him to the Washington Wizards on Feb. 10, 2022. He originally came to the Mavs from New York in a deal which also include the No. 24 overall pick going to the Knicks in this year's NBA Draft.\n\n\"It wasn't just perfect for us playing together,\" Porzingis said. \"It didn't work out, that's it. We moved on. There's no, like, ill-will from their side, for sure from my side. I don't think there should be.\n\n\"(It) just didn't work out. But I have nothing but love for Dallas and for the teammates and for everybody there.\"\n\nEMBRACE THE FINALS, AND ENJOY IT: Mavs coach Jason Kidd said when he was playing for New Jersey, and the Nets got swept, 4-0, in the 2002 NBA Finals by a Los Angeles Lakers squad led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, in retrospect it's easy for him to analyze exactly what happened.\n\n\"Sometimes you don't have enough talent,\" Kidd said. \"As I brought up the Lakers and Nets, we were happy to be there, but we just didn't have enough talent to beat Kobe and Shaq. It could be that simple. But nerves sometimes play a part, too. Just the human side of things.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, as much as we've talked about it, to embrace it, to stay steady, and to enjoy this time because you're not promised anything to come back the following year. We have an opportunity here to find a way to win on the road. That's how we're approaching it. That's what the Finals are all about is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nBRIEFLY: The NBA has released the names of the 12 referees who will officiate this year's NBA Finals. Here's the list with, in parathesis, how many different years the referee has officiated in the NBA Finals. They are: Tony Brothers (13), James Capers (12), Marc Davis (13), Scott Foster (17), John Goble (8), David Guthrie (7), Bill Kennedy (6), Courtney Kirkland (4), Kevin Scott (2), Josh Tiven (5), James Williams (4) and Zach Zarba (11). Foster has officiated 24 NBA Finals games, followed by Davis with 20 and Brothers with 16. Tyler Ford and Ben Taylor have been assigned as alternate referees for the NBA Finals. . .Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis has been cleared to play in Game 1. But he said it's tough to say how effective he'll be because he hasn't played since April 29 when he strained his right calf in Game 4 of the first-round series against Miami. \"Tomorrow will be my real, like, first real minutes in a while, you know,\" Porzingis said. \"I did as much as I could to prepare for this moment, but there's nothing like game minutes and game experience that I'm going to get tomorrow. It will be tough to jump into the Finals like this.\" . . . Mavs center Daniel Gafford, when asked what type of advantage the Mavs have in this best-of-seven series against the Celtics, said: \"Just coming out, setting the tone. We got a lot of energy around this team. We got a great atmosphere around this team. If we come out with our heads on straight, I feel like it's going to be a pretty good situation.\" . . . The Celtics lost to the Golden State Warriors in the 2022 NBA Finals, and they also lost to the Miami Heat in last year's Eastern Conference Finals. This year, the Celtics came roaring back and won the East with a 64-18 record and were the only NBA team to win 60-plus games. \"I think you can see in our excitement when we won the conference,\" Celtics forward Jayson Tatum said. \"Obviously, that's not the end all, be all, but it really is tough to get to this moment. I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that. Just excited to play some basketball after this long break and go out there and try to get the job done.\" . . . Guillermo Rodriguez, the sidekick on the Jimmy Kimmel Show, was among the several hundred media folks who attended Wednesday's Media Day. Rodriguez did several skits with players from both teams, which will be seen on Kimmel's show on Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. on ABC . . . To say that Mavs second-year guard Jaden Hardy is ready for Game 1 to start would be the understatement of the day. \"This experience is amazing,\" Hardy said. \"I look at it as a blessing. A lot of people play their careers and never get a chance to play in the Finals. I would never take this for granted. I'm just super grateful to be here. Can't wait to get started.\"", "source": {"uri": "mavs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Official Home of the Dallas Mavericks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His handle and ability to finish at the rim despite being a 6-foot-2-inch point guard is remarkable. But after LeBron James, Irving's former teammate, anointed Irving as \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen,\" former NBA player Paul Pierce said that simply cannot be true.\n\nOn FS1's 'Undisputed' program, Pierce, Skip Bayless, and Keyshawn Johnson discussed James' comments, with Pierce especially taking exception.\n\n\"Gifted? I'm not so sure about 'gifted,' Skip,\" Pierce said. \"Skilled? Maybe. But when I think about gifted, the first player that comes to mind is Michael Jordan. Because you talk about the physical attributes to go along with the skill. And that's what I look at when you say 'gifted.' The height, the speed, the hands, the arms -- all of those physical attributes play a part in [being] gifted. Kyrie, he's a shorter player with a good ballhandle, and yeah, of course we know about his skills. So I'll say skilled.\"\n\nPierce did not stop there, though, and went on to name who he believes is the most 'gifted' player in the NBA.\n\n\"But if we want to really know who is the most gifted player -- the most gifted today is Victor Wembanyama. We've never seen anything like that,\" Pierce said before explaining Wembanyama's height and length, along with his skill, is unprecedented.\n\nWhile the semantics are always tough to argue, it would be very difficult to disagree with the idea that Wembanyama, at 7 feet, 4 inches tall, and with an 8-foot wingspan, is one of, if not the most 'gifted' players of all time. While there have been a few players in NBA history to have the size and length of Wembanyama, none have retained the agility and athleticism that Wembanyama has.\n\nKyrie Irving: Most skilled player ever?\n\nIt is not an unpopular opinion among NBA players to say that Kyrie Irving is one of the most skilled players in NBA history. Former teammates and opponents alike have praised the notoriously crafty Irving for his ballhandling, shotmaking, and finishing abilities, with some saying he is a 'genius' and a 'wizard.'\n\nSo it did not come as too much of a surprise when LeBron James, who won the 2016 NBA Championship alongside Irving when they were on the Cleveland Cavaliers, would think he's played with the \"most gifted\" player ever.\n\n\"There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do,\" James said on the 'Mind the Game' podcast with JJ Redick. \"And sitting here watching it, I'm like, I'm playing like, so f -- ing happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth and whatever the case may be, and at the same time, I am so f -- ing mad at the same time that I am not his running mate anymore.\n\n\"I have so many words to praise Kyrie that I end up with absolutely none... He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen,\" James said. \"He has the best gifts I've ever seen of any NBA player.\"\n\nAnd it's not hard to wonder why James would be upset watching Irving. The pair only played together for three seasons before Irving requested and was granted a trade to the Boston Celtics in the 2017 offseason. Since then, James and Irving have seemed to rekindle their friendship after a period of iciness, and the duo reportedly flirted with the idea of reuniting last offseason before Irving re-signed with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThat move turned out to be one of the best in his career, as the Mavericks are now in the NBA Finals after overpowering the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals.

Sitting here watching it, I'm playing like so f***ing happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth or whatever the case may be. At the same time, I'm so f***ing mad at the same time that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nIrving met with the media before Game 1 of the Finals and was asked about the comments (h/t Mike Curtis of The Dallas Morning News).\n\nIrving: \"I think we've both been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish. I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man and be comfortable in it, stand on my square and my beliefs and where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship is different because of that now. Definitely miss him. Playing out there just making things easier, being able to run the floor, and just throw the ball to somebody like that, throw it in the air, as athletic as they come. Just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table.\"\n\nIrving and James were teammates on the Cleveland Cavaliers for three seasons.\n\nThey made the NBA Finals every year and won the 2016 title over Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Mortgage_FieldHouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2991,h_1682,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastbreak/01hzmz2bm7rartndm2af.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-05-19", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Breaking down Mavericks star's playoff history with Cavaliers, Celtics, Nets", "body": "Kyrie Irving's highlight tape is unrivaled when it comes to ball handling and crafty finishers around the rim.\n\nHe's established himself as one of the league's best point guards and will be a Hall of Famer when he retires from basketball. He's essentially done it all -- All-Star appearances, All-NBA nods and even raised the Larry O'Brien trophy.\n\nDespite some unevenness, Irving has exceeded expectations throughout his career -- which were always set high after he was the No. 1 pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Now, the 13-year veteran is back in the NBA Finals with the chance of adding another NBA championship to an already impressive resume.\n\nHow many rings does Irving have? The Sporting News provides the answer below.\n\nMORE: Who will win the NBA Finals: Celtics or Mavericks?\n\nIrving won one championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. This title was one of the more memorable championships in recent memory for many NBA fans.\n\nIt was Cleveland's first major sports title in 52 years, and the point guard helped LeBron James fulfill his promise of bringing a title to the city. The series included multiple heroic moments, from James' block to Irving's last-minute, go-ahead 3-pointer over Stephen Curry.\n\nIrving has been to three NBA Finals, all with the Cavaliers (2015, 2016 and 2017). He fractured his kneecap during Game 1 of the 2015 Finals, which sidelined him for months.\n\nHe played in all seven games in 2016, winning the championship, but he lost to the Warriors in five games in 2017. All three appearances were against Golden State.\n\nMORE: Re-grading the Kyrie Irving trade between the Mavericks and Nets\n\nIrving has reached the playoffs in seven seasons and with four different teams: Cavaliers, Celtics, Nets and Mavericks. All three appearances with the Cavaliers resulted in NBA Finals trips, and he's back for the first time since with the Mavericks in 2024.\n\nHe did not reach the conference finals in his one postseason trip with the Celtics and two with the Nets.\n\nMORE: What is Kyrie Irving's record in closeout playoff games?\n\nHere's a look at Irving's stats across seven playoff appearances, including this year's ongoing run:\n\n*Playoffs still ongoing\n\nIrving's resume is impressive, but how does he stack up against Hall of Fame point guards?\n\nHe's already won more than John Stockton, Chris Paul and Steve Nash, but adding a second title would put him in a more exclusive club.\n\nHere's a look at Hall of Fame point guards with at least two NBA championships:", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stockton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/GettyImages-2155365827.jpg?itok=YbsdJR3N", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Don't overthink it.\n\n\"Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength.\"\n\nThe Celtics swept the Mavericks during the regular season, and some Boston fans will be more than ready to zero in on Irving as a target for heckling.\n\nIrving said he will carry a fearless approach into TD Garden for Game 1 Thursday night, regardless of what is said to him.\n\n\"There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball,\" Irving said. \"The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nIrving played a key role on the LeBron James-led Cavaliers who eliminated the Celtics in seven games on their way to a championship in 2016.\n\nHe said being back in the NBA Finals eight years later is a reminder of how fleeting such opportunities can be.\n\n\"When you ascend to this level, you put in a lot of hard work, you beat some of the best in the world,\" Irving said. \"Competing with some of the best in the world, I looked at it as, oh I'm going to be here every single year.\"\n\n\"At this age I've been through what I've been through, been able to come out on the other side. I look at it as an opportunity that I don't want to take for granted. I want it to last as long as possible emotionally just because of how much it took to get here.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Mind the Game\", a podcast that he co-hosts with JJ Redick, James said he considers Irving to be \"the most gifted player the NBA\" has ever seen and that he missed having him as a teammate.\n\nIrving said the feeling was mutual, and that he looks to draw upon his past experiences with James to help him during this series.\n\n\"I definitely think about those times,\" Irving said. \"Now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect but also now I'm at this stage, able to use some of the formulas that I was taught from him, some of the great teachers that have come before me.\n\n\"I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game.\"\n\nRockets forward Jabari Smith stopped by to ask Jayson Tatum for some advice at his media conference. Tatum was surprised to see the 21-year-old Smith.\n\nSmith was picked No. 3 overall in 2022 and was a second-team all-rookie selection in 2023. He asked Tatum what he would say to a young player who isn't quite living up to the lofty expectations set for him.\n\nTatum said he had been there before, told Smith to keep working hard and enjoy his career, and then laughed at himself for sounding like an old person.\n\n\"In the sense of your career, I would say, man, enjoy it. There's going to be some great times,\" Tatum said. There's going to be some times that aren't so great. It's okay to be upset because that means you care, right? You want to be great. People believe that you can. They just try to rush the process.\n\n\"It takes however long it takes. But as long as you work hard, you believe, you got the right support system. Obviously, you do down in Houston. I know all those guys, coaches.

No matter what, we're going to go at each other.\"\n\nIrving came to the Celtics in 2017 after six seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He left for the Brooklyn Nets after two seasons, though, and soon sparred with Celtics fans over a series of incidents.\n\nIn one incident, in 2022, he raised his middle fingers toward the crowd during a playoff series between the Nets and Celtics.\n\n\"That wasn't a good reflection of who I am and how I like to compete,\" Irving said.\n\n\"It's good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well,\" he continued. \"They still respect great basketball.\"\n\nWhile he said he is ready to make his return, Irving did not mince words when it came to explaining his frustration with the Celtics.\n\n\"It's just, a little bit more grace could have been extended my way especially with what I was dealing with during that time as a human being,\" he said. \"I know sometimes in sports it's literally about the end goal and the result and what you accomplish and that's one thing, but we're still human at the end of the day.\"\n\nAs competitive as the finals series is expected to be, Irving said he has nothing but respect for the Celtics.\n\n\"They've improved tremendously,\" he said. \"...So, I'm nothing short of proud of the guys for what they've been able to do.\"\n\nGame 1 between the Celtics and Mavericks is set for Thursday at 8:30 p.m. in Boston.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

Jaylen Brown is an interesting case since he didn't always see eye-to-eye with Irving when he was in Boston. However, the two connected more in recent years and built a stronger bond.\n\nAt NBA Finals Media Day at the TD Garden on Wednesday, Brown spoke on his relationship with the Mavericks All-Star and how happy he is to see Irving's resurgence in Dallas after an underwhelming tenure with the Nets.\n\n\"I think it was great,\" Brown said. \"Definitely learned a lot from Kyrie while he was here. It's been great to see his journey, see where he's at, all the stuff he's going through, stuff like that, to be where he's at it's amazing, it's dope to see.\"\n\nThe bigger challenge at hand now for Brown is figuring out the best way to slow Irving as a second option next to Luka Doncic. Brown will likely spend a ton of time defending both players during the Finals but he isn't going on himself to slow them down.\n\n\"How to stop him? That's a great player over there, so it's going to be a full-team effort,\" Brown said. \"Him and Luka. Making sure we're alert, making sure we're back in transition, and do the best we can.\"\n\nIrving has spoke highly of Brown and Tatum, especially in recent years after the team swept the Nets in 2022. Irving's last game with the Nets and trade demand came right after a blowout win by Boston. The Mavericks have found a way to put together\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better,\" Irving said. \"They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\n\n\"They have a great team over there, led by a great coach. So we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough series. They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more.\n\nThis is what I've been preparing for since last summer or when our season ended last year of putting in the time to prepare for moments like this.\"\n\nThe Celtics host the Mavericks in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night at TD Garden.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/RW3IPCX4ZJAGZKFKJD4VKPRRMI.jpg?auth=7824712048cc0e19029c4908f4219242b900c7a94e14f85b70b64d48f3becbfd&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

After a tough start to his tenure in Dallas, he found a groove this year and helped lead the team to the 2024 NBA Finals, where it will face the Boston Celtics.\n\nWindhorst noted that the Lakers had another opportunity to add Irving last offseason when he was a free agent, but their lack of interest influenced his decision to re-sign with the Mavs.\n\n\"The Lakers actually could've created the cap space to beat the Mavericks' offer last year, but they elected not to,\" Windhorst said. \"They elected to re-sign the players from the team that had just gotten to the Western Conference Finals.\"\n\nWindhorst added that it's unlikely that Irving and James will have the chance to wear the same uniform again, but anything is possible.\n\n\"I do not suspect that we're gonna see an opportunity for them to play again, but I would never say never in the NBA,\" Windhorst said.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doric_sam@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Doric Sam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Windhorst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Windhorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1717593577/rrbaeuyuitmfioaifwsv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

That is, until Dallas Mavericks star Kyrie Irving signed his father Drederick to a shoe deal with his ANTA line.\n\nAccording to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic, Drederick Irving will be Kyrie's first signature athlete at ANTA. This is a historic moment in the sneaker world because it's the first time a player has signed his own father to a shoe deal.\n\nPreviously with Nike, Irving signed with Chinese brand ANTA in September of 2023. Since then, Irving has launched the ANTA KAI 1, part of his own line within the company.\n\nThis first-of-its-kind shoe deal isn't the only reason Irving is in the news. He and the Mavericks will be taking on the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals, and Irving recently reflected on the last time he went to TD Garden in the postseason.\n\n\"But I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs [with Brooklyn] and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my shit a little bit,\" Irving said. \"That wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level. It wasn't a great reflection on my end towards the next generation on what it means to control your emotions in that type of environment, no matter what people are yelling at you.\"\n\nIrving will take the floor in Boston on Thursday night, when Game 1 tips off at 8:30 p.m. ET.

But feeling good,\" he said at media day on Wednesday. \"(It) burns inside of me, not being able to be out there. But tomorrow finally I'll get the chance and I'm excited.\"\n\nPorzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29.\n\n\"I did as much as I could to prepare for this moment, but there's nothing like game minutes and game experience that I'm going to get tomorrow,\" he said. \"It will be tough to jump into the finals like this.\"\n\nAn offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games.\n\nHe left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds, when Boston eliminated Cleveland in five games and swept the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\"Guys so far have been playing great, taking care of business, guys stepping up,\" he said, singling out Al Horford's work at center in his absence. \"I just look forward to add more to complete the mission.\"\n\nKYRIE AND LEBRON\n\nLeBron James praised former teammate Kyrie Irving on a podcast, calling him \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nThe feeling is mutual.\n\n\"There's a lot of gratitude there, as well,\" Irving said on Wednesday when asked if he had heard James' comments. \"I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish.\"\n\nJames said on his podcast \"Mind the Game\" that he's happy and proud to watch Irving in the finals, but at the same time he's \"mad that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\n\"There was nothing on a basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do,\" he said.\n\nIrving and James reached the finals three straight seasons with the Cavaliers, winning it all in 2016 and losing to the Warriors the following year. Then Irving requested a trade, and the relationship soured.\n\n\"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger,\" Irving said at NBA Finals media day on Wednesday. \"Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now.\n\n\"(I) definitely miss him,\" Irving said. \"Just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life.\"\n\nIrving wound up in Boston, where he also had a still-festering fallout. In previous trips back to the Garden, he has been received rudely and a similar welcome is expected for Game 1 on Thursday night.\n\nTRASH-TALKING TIM\n\nTim Hardaway Jr. couldn't resist the chance to talk trash about his father.\n\nAsked on Wednesday what it meant for him to be playing in the NBA Finals for the first time, Hardaway said, \"It means a lot. Especially being the first of my family to do so.\" Reporters chuckled and gasped.\n\nHardaway's father was a five-time All-Star in 13 NBA seasons and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2022. He finished in the top 10 of the NBA MVP voting three times, and also won a gold medal at the 2000 Olympics.\n\nBut he only made it as far as the conference finals once, losing with the Miami Heat to Michael Jordan's Bulls in 1997.\n\nHardaway Jr. has never averaged 20 points in a season, like his father did five times, and his award votes have come mostly as a sixth man. But he said he had the advantage of his father's experience.\n\n\"I wouldn't get to this point without my dad,\" he said. \"He's always by my side. He's always a phone call away. He's always supporting me, always coming to the games. He's a phone call away when I'm struggling, when I'm not, even if I'm having great games in a stretch, he's telling me to keep my head down, don't stop, keep that energy, keep that flow going. And, he's always reiterating to me: always have fun. He's been telling me that since high school, and that's what I've been trying to do my whole entire career.\n\n\"The guy has lived it and done it. So, you know, that's that's that's the luxury I do have of having a father that played in this league.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sixth man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 538, "textEnd": 546}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Another disappointing season didn't keep one of the NBA's top point guards from listing the team on his trade wishlist, though.\n\nIronically enough, the Cavaliers finished with a 51-31 record that same season, the exact opposite of the Knicks. Cleveland made it to the NBA Finals for the third straight year but came up short to Golden State. Kyrie Irving averaged a then career-high 25.2 points per game on 47.3% shooting from the field and 40.1% from three. Behind LeBron James (26.4 points per game), Irving was the team's second-leading scorer.\n\nEven with that success, 2016-17 was Irving's final season with the Cavaliers. A fallout with LeBron contributed to the point guard requesting a trade that offseason. Irving has since said he regrets how things ended, especially because Cleveland could've won another title (or more) with that duo.\n\nIrving was eventually dealt to the Celtics, although they weren't on his trade destination list. Yahoo Sports' Jake Fischer recently reported that the Knicks, Spurs, Timberwolves, and Heat were the teams the point guard wanted to go to. His agent told Cleveland that he didn't want to go to Boston.\n\nBelieve it or not, but in 2017, Irving seemingly would've been happy with a trade to New York. Maybe the front office wouldn't have traded Carmelo Anthony to Oklahoma City that September if the Knicks traded for Kyrie. How different would things have been?\n\nIrving's stint in Boston didn't go as planned, so much so that the Knicks and Celtics engaged in trade talks in 2019 that would've sent Kristaps Porzingis to Boston and Irving to New York. Irving could've been a Knick on two occasions before 2019 free agency. It's bewildering that he chose Brooklyn over New York when he had the choice. Look how that worked out for him.\n\nAfter a couple of unsuccessful stops, Kyrie has found a home in Dallas. He's returning to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2017 when he was in Cleveland. Would he have ended New York's finals drought if he had been traded there in 2017? Or if he had signed in 2019? Eh, probably not.\n\nThings worked out for the best; if the Knicks had gotten Kyrie, they might not have signed Jalen Brunson in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "dailyknicks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Knicks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4042,h_2273,x_0,y_21/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/27/01hzj5p39npbz7zszddt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

But feeling good,\" he said at media day on Wednesday. \"(It) burns inside of me, not being able to be out there. But tomorrow finally I'll get the chance and I'm excited.\"\n\nPorzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29.\n\n\"I did as much as I could to prepare for this moment, but there's nothing like game minutes and game experience that I'm going to get tomorrow,\" he said. \"It will be tough to jump into the finals like this.\"\n\nAn offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games.\n\nHe left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds, when Boston eliminated Cleveland in five games and swept the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\"Guys so far have been playing great, taking care of business, guys stepping up,\" he said, singling out Al Horford's work at center in his absence. \"I just look forward to add more to complete the mission.\"\n\nKYRIE AND LEBRON\n\nLeBron James praised former teammate Kyrie Irving on a podcast, calling him \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nThe feeling is mutual.\n\n\"There's a lot of gratitude there, as well,\" Irving said on Wednesday when asked if he had heard James' comments. \"I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish.\"\n\nJames said on his podcast \"Mind the Game\" that he's happy and proud to watch Irving in the finals, but at the same time he's \"mad that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\n\"There was nothing on a basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do,\" he said.\n\nIrving and James reached the finals three straight seasons with the Cavaliers, winning it all in 2016 and losing to the Warriors the following year. Then Irving requested a trade, and the relationship soured.\n\n\"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger,\" Irving said at NBA Finals media day on Wednesday. \"Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now.\n\n\"(I) definitely miss him,\" Irving said. \"Just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table.

But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games.\n\nHe left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds, when Boston eliminated Cleveland in five games and swept the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\"Guys so far have been playing great, taking care of business, guys stepping up,\" he said, singling out Al Horford's work at center in his absence. \"I just look forward to add more to complete the mission.\"\n\nKYRIE AND LEBRON\n\nLeBron James praised former teammate Kyrie Irving on a podcast, calling him \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nThe feeling is mutual.\n\n\"There's a lot of gratitude there, as well,\" Irving said on Wednesday when asked if he had heard James' comments. \"I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish.\"\n\nJames said on his podcast \"Mind the Game\" that he's happy and proud to watch Irving in the finals, but at the same time he's \"mad that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\n\"There was nothing on a basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do,\" he said.\n\nIrving and James reached the finals three straight seasons with the Cavaliers, winning it all in 2016 and losing to the Warriors the following year. Then Irving requested a trade, and the relationship soured.\n\n\"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger,\" Irving said at NBA Finals media day on Wednesday. \"Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now.\n\n\"(I) definitely miss him,\" Irving said. \"Just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table.

I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life.\"\n\nIrving wound up in Boston, where he also had a still-festering fallout.

In an interview with Rachel Nichols and DeMarcus Cousins on the Bully Ball podcast, Thomas was asked if he would place Kyrie Irving ahead of Tatum.\n\nThomas answered thus when Nichols asked whether he and Cousins would rank Irving ahead of Tatum: \"I am... Imma just rock with that.Jayson Tatum and those guys are really good. Jaylen Brown is really good. But Luka and Kyrie are something we haven't seen. And they have the best duo, like they don't just have the best player. I feel like they're the best duo. They just don't have the best team.\"\n\nAfter spending years with the Cavaliers, Kyrie Irving was moved to the Celtics for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, and Ante Zizic, in the 2018 first-round selection of the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nThomas also emphasized the uniqueness of the Irving-Doncic combination. He said it presents a basketball dynamic that has never been witnessed before. Before settling in Dallas, Irving and Thomas each made many trips across the league, with Thomas finding it challenging to get a job on an NBA franchise.\n\nAccording to the NBA, Jayson Tatum averaged 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 4.9 assists on 47.1% shooting. In the 2024 playoffs, he sustained this level of play, averaging 26.0 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists on 44.2% shooting.\n\nHowever, Kyrie Irving shot 41.1% from 3-point range and 49.7% from the field during the regular season, averaging 25.6 points, 5.2 assists, and 5.0 rebounds in 58 games.\n\nHe has been averaging 22.8 points, 5.2 assists, and 3.9 rebounds per game in the playoffs this year.

LeBron James, a former teammate of Kidd, has shown support for the Mavericks, acknowledging their talent and coaching prowess.\n\nIn a recent conversation with JJ Redick, James jokingly mentioned that \"Laker Nation is going for the Dallas Laker Mavericks,\" highlighting his admiration for Kidd and the Mavericks' capabilities. He expressed confidence in Kidd's ability to devise a game plan to counter the Celtics' three-point dominance.\n\nFurthermore, James praised Kyrie Irving, referring to him as a wizard on the basketball court. He acknowledged Irving's skills and growth, expressing both pride and regret at no longer being his teammate. With Irving and Doncic forming a potent duo, the Mavericks pose a significant threat to the Celtics in the upcoming Finals.\n\nAs Irving prepares to face his former team, the Celtics, tensions are high. Irving's history with the Celtics, marked by controversial departures and fan animosity, adds an intriguing narrative to the Finals. Despite past confrontations, Irving has adopted a more composed demeanor since joining the Mavericks, focusing on his team's success and the upcoming challenge against the Celtics.\n\nWith Game 1 of the NBA Finals approaching, the spotlight is on Irving and the Mavericks as they aim to overcome the Celtics' formidable lineup.

Despite his star power, Irving faced challenges during his time with the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets. However, his averages of 23.8 points, 5.2 assists, and 3.9 rebounds in the playoffs have highlighted his impact on the Mavericks.\n\nWhen Irving was traded to the Mavericks in 2023, it raised eyebrows and generated mixed reactions. Critics doubted his ability to thrive in Dallas given his history of trade requests and injury concerns. However, Irving's performance with the Mavericks has silenced the skeptics, with his leadership qualities shining through on and off the court.\n\nThe trade that brought Irving to Dallas involved significant player exchanges. The Mavericks received Irving and Markieff Morris, while the Nets acquired Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, and future draft picks. Despite initial reservations about Irving's future with the team, his contributions have been invaluable in elevating the Mavericks to championship contention.\n\nIrving's statistics with the Mavericks speak for themselves, with impressive numbers in both the regular season and playoffs. His impact on the team's success cannot be understated, as he has seamlessly integrated into the roster alongside star player Luka Doncic.\n\nIn terms of his contract details, Irving signed a lucrative three-year, $120 million deal with the Mavericks in 2023, ensuring his presence on the team for the foreseeable future. His performance on the court and commitment to the franchise have solidified his position as a key player for Dallas.\n\nOverall, the Kyrie Irving trade to the Mavericks has proven to be a game-changer for the team, propelling them to new heights in the NBA.

Because of that, free agency isn't too far away for the No.1 overall pick of the 2011 NBA Draft.\n\nDuring his recent interview with ESPN's Malika Andrews, the host asked Kai if he could see himself retiring with the Mavericks, and the 32-year-old responded with an answer that Mavericks fans loved.\n\n\"The future is still being written,\" said Irving. \"But I can tell you that with all the extensions that are going around with J-Kidd and Nico, and potentially there's some of it...Luka. I think again I don't mind being complementary if we're going to continue to put this band together and we have some great pieces around us.\"\n\nMavs have extended J-Kidd and Nico Harrison\n\nWith the Mavericks' success this season, team owner Mark Cuban began keeping the pieces that have sent them to the 2024 NBA Finals. First was head coach Jason Kidd, whom the Mavs signed to a multi-year extension with the team. A couple of days ago, the team also re-signed GM Nico Harrison to his multi-year deal.\n\nHarrison is credited for building the Mavs Finals-bound team. He traded for Kyrie Irving last season, drafted Dereck Lively II last summer, and then acquired P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford before the trade deadline. Irving blended well with Doncic in Year 2, and the trade deadline moves paid off as the Mavs finished the season strong.\n\n\"But there's always those thoughts that will creep in, just the 'What if?', 'What could happen?' You'll never know, right? A season is a season. So, I just like to let it play out and stay in the present moment. But I am enjoying my time here. I've enjoyed my time here. But yeah it's been a great journey so far,\" Kai added.\n\nIrving has settled down in a complementary role in Dallas\n\nMeanwhile, the 6-foot-2 guard has enjoyed a renaissance in Dallas. After he was almost written off following his departure from Cleveland, Irving settled down in a complementary role with the Mavericks. As Kidd said, Irving has been comfortable with his game and giving Luka advice.\n\n\"Kai is older. He has been in this situation before in Cleveland with LeBron [James]. He's been with other stars. He's comfortable with his game, he's comfortable with giving advice. His calming influence has helped Luka too. Luka is fiery. Sometimes when you have someone who's calming, [it] can help,\" the Mavs head coach said.\n\nYears ago, Irving left Cleveland because he wanted to play a bigger role on the team but couldn't do that because LeBron was there. Now, Kyrie is willing to stay in Dallas to play second fiddle to Luka.

It was one tumultuous moment of many in a tension-filled tenure with Brooklyn that ended with his trade to the Mavericks about 10 months later.\n\nHealthier and happier, as he likes to say, Irving is back on the biggest stage in his sport with the Mavs set to face the Celtics in the NBA Finals starting Thursday.\n\nThroughout the deepest playoff run for Dallas in 13 years, the reflective side of Irving has surfaced frequently, stopping short of mea culpas but making clear he's learned a lot along the way.\n\n\"I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (stuff) a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level,\" Irving said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic and Irving's refusal to get vaccinated, which meant he couldn't play in home games for Brooklyn because of New York City's vaccine mandate for employees.\n\nNext was Irving's social media post of a link to a movie containing antisemitic material, which led to a suspension from the Nets and the end of his longtime business relationship with Nike.\n\nUltimately, Irving asked out of Brooklyn, and he and Durant were traded days apart last year, giving Irving a new co-star in Mavs point guard Luka Doncic.\n\nThe partial season together didn't work out for Irving and Doncic. Dallas missed the playoffs. However, the duo's first full season together is exactly what the Mavs were expecting when they pulled off general manager Nico Harrison's first blockbuster trade.\n\n\"I'm enjoying every step of the way, Irving said. \"I'm not taking anything for granted. I'm enjoying the hot weather right now. I'm enjoying the Dallas community. We talked about this early in the season, just how much I felt embraced.\"\n\nCeltics' Brown, Tatum feel better equipped\n\nJaylen Brown has a $300 million contract, and Jayson Tatum is expected to get one, too.\n\nBut, neither player seems to care who's considered Boston's best player. And with the Celtics back in the NBA Finals for the second time in three years, they have another chance to finally win a ring that has alluded them.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason.\n\nBrown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nTatum believes they've both used lessons from the 2022 NBA Finals' loss, as well as last year's conference finals loss to Miami, to grow into players more equipped to accomplish their championship goal this time around.\n\nNBA Finals\n\nBoston vs. Dallas\n\nThursday: at Boston, 7:30

It was one tumultuous moment of many in a tension-filled tenure with Brooklyn that ended with his trade to the Mavericks about 10 months later.\n\nHealthier and happier, as he likes to say, Irving is back on the biggest stage in his sport with the Mavs set to face the Celtics in the NBA Finals starting Thursday.\n\nThroughout the deepest playoff run for Dallas in 13 years, the reflective side of Irving has surfaced frequently, stopping short of mea culpas but making clear he's learned a lot along the way.\n\n\"I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (stuff) a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level,\" Irving said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic and Irving's refusal to get vaccinated, which meant he couldn't play in home games for Brooklyn because of New York City's vaccine mandate for employees.\n\nNext was Irving's social media post of a link to a movie containing antisemitic material, which led to a suspension from the Nets and the end of his longtime business relationship with Nike.\n\nUltimately, Irving asked out of Brooklyn, and he and Durant were traded days apart last year, giving Irving a new co-star in Mavs point guard Luka Doncic.\n\nThe partial season together didn't work out for Irving and Doncic. Dallas missed the playoffs. However, the duo's first full season together is exactly what the Mavs were expecting when they pulled off general manager Nico Harrison's first blockbuster trade.\n\n\"I'm enjoying every step of the way, Irving said. \"I'm not taking anything for granted. I'm enjoying the hot weather right now. I'm enjoying the Dallas community. We talked about this early in the season, just how much I felt embraced.\"\n\nCeltics' Brown, Tatum feel better equipped\n\nJaylen Brown has a $300 million contract, and Jayson Tatum is expected to get one, too.\n\nBut, neither player seems to care who's considered Boston's best player. And with the Celtics back in the NBA Finals for the second time in three years, they have another chance to finally win a ring that has alluded them.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason.\n\nBrown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nTatum believes they've both used lessons from the 2022 NBA Finals' loss, as well as last year's conference finals loss to Miami, to grow into players more equipped to accomplish their championship goal this time around.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

At the time, Boston was the most exciting young team in the Eastern Conference, coming off a conference finals appearance that helped cement them as the next team in line if LeBron James ever decided to do something crazy, like join the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency.\n\nWhile Kyrie Irving couldn't play during that run -- which ended with a Game 7 loss at home to James and the Cleveland Cavaliers -- due to a knee injury, the All-Star guard was one of the stars on that Celtics team -- the guy Danny Ainge acquired in a trade with the Cavs the previous year to get them another championship. And in a moment in front of Boston's fans, Irving decided to express his intention to re-sign with the team instead of entering free agency the next summer.\n\nAnd then, Irving never signed a deal, and things deteriorated over what became his final year with the Celtics. You can pick from any number of moments where the vibes were just completely off, from the time Irving admitted that he called James and apologized for not realizing how hard being a leader is, to any of the comments to the media where Irving was just a little too blunt about, well, everything.\n\n\"It was just a chapter in my life that I got to enjoy for the most part,\" Irving told the media this week, per Tim MacMahon of ESPN. \"We had a great opportunity to do some special things, but it was cut short, just based off personal reasons on my end. One thing I look back on my time in Boston -- I've said this over the past few years, but somehow it gets tossed under the rug -- but the greatest thing I learned from Boston was just being able to manage not only my emotions or just what's going on on a day-to-day basis of being a leader of a team or being one of the leaders, and having young guys around you that have their own goals, but you have to learn how to put the big picture first.\"\n\nWhen free agency rolled around at the end of June in 2019, he decided to team up with Kevin Durant as a member of the Brooklyn Nets. It sent a shockwave throughout the league, largely because while the rumblings of Durant and Irving teaming up in the Big Apple weren't new, the expectation was that they'd head to Madison Square Garden and join the New York Knicks, instead.\n\nIt was quite the blow for the Knicks, which had just seen one of its hopeful building blocks leave town. Six months earlier, New York made the decision to trade Kristaps Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks and end his tenure in New York after three and a half years -- reports indicated that a meeting between Porzingis and the Knicks led the team to believe he wanted a trade, as he had concerns about the direction of the franchise. What started as a promising marriage between a team desperate to get over the hump and a lottery pick whose skillset got him nicknamed \"The Unicorn\" devolved, and the Mavs were there to take advantage.\n\nBefore he ever got to play a game in a Dallas uniform, the team gave Porzingis a lucrative 5-year contract extension, as they finally got the running mate that would help Luka Doncic go from a budding superstar to an MVP with an All-Star sidekick.

It was one tumultuous moment of many in a tension-filled tenure with Brooklyn that ended with his trade to the Mavericks about 10 months later.\n\nHealthier and happier, as he likes to say, Irving is back on the biggest stage in his sport with the Mavs set to face the Celtics in the NBA Finals starting Thursday.\n\nThroughout the deepest playoff run for Dallas in 13 years, the reflective side of Irving has surfaced frequently, stopping short of mea culpas but making clear he's learned a lot along the way.\n\n\"I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (stuff) a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level,\" Irving said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic and Irving's refusal to get vaccinated, which meant he couldn't play in home games for Brooklyn because of New York City's vaccine mandate for employees.\n\nNext was Irving's social media post of a link to a movie containing antisemitic material, which led to a suspension from the Nets and the end of his longtime business relationship with Nike.\n\nUltimately, Irving asked out of Brooklyn, and he and Durant were traded days apart last year, giving Irving a new co-star in Mavs point guard Luka Doncic.\n\nThe partial season together didn't work out for Irving and Doncic. Dallas missed the playoffs. However, the duo's first full season together is exactly what the Mavs were expecting when they pulled off general manager Nico Harrison's first blockbuster trade.\n\n\"I'm enjoying every step of the way, Irving said. \"I'm not taking anything for granted. I'm enjoying the hot weather right now. I'm enjoying the Dallas community. We talked about this early in the season, just how much I felt embraced.\"\n\nCeltics' Brown, Tatum feel better equipped\n\nJaylen Brown has a $300 million contract, and Jayson Tatum is expected to get one, too.\n\nBut, neither player seems to care who's considered Boston's best player. And with the Celtics back in the NBA Finals for the second time in three years, they have another chance to finally win a ring that has alluded them.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason.\n\nBrown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nTatum believes they've both used lessons from the 2022 NBA Finals' loss, as well as last year's conference finals loss to Miami, to grow into players more equipped to accomplish their championship goal this time around.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to

Once he had collected five world championships, he started to become a mentor to members of the next generation.\n\nTwo of those mentees will be taking part in this year's title series: Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics and Kyrie Irving of the Dallas Mavericks.

Each time he's touched the ball, he's been met with a chorus of boos.\n\nAhead of Game 1, Irving was asked how he's handled the response from the Garden faithful.\n\n\"You just got to breathe through it,\" he told reporters at NBA Finals Media Day. \"To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions, what they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it.\"\n\nHis response is something that he feels he's been able to improve on, over the course of his many returns to Boston.\n\n\"Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball. The fans are going to say what they're going to say.

Revisiting Kyrie Irving's decision to leave Celtics for Nets | Business Upturn", "body": "You'd think Celtics fans had a front-row seat to a Greek tragedy every time Kyrie Irving touches the ball in the 2024 NBA Finals. Seriously, it's like witnessing a rollercoaster of emotions with every dribble.\n\nSure, it might seem like eons ago, but let's not forget, it's been a mere five seasons since Irving graced Boston's parquet floors.\n\nThe whole saga kicked off in 2017 with a blockbuster trade that saw Isaiah Thomas, a beloved figure in Celtics lore, shipped off to the Cavaliers in exchange for the enigmatic Irving. It was supposed to be the move that propelled the Celtics to championship glory, with Irving as the linchpin of a burgeoning super team. But alas, basketball, much like life, rarely goes according to script.\n\nInjuries, drama, and a dash of off-court antics quickly turned the Celtics' dream into a nightmare. Two seasons passed, marked by tantalizing glimpses of potential squandered in a sea of missed opportunities.\n\nThen came the fateful decision: Irving, amidst whispers of broken promises and shattered dreams, bid adieu to Boston in free agency. The parting left a bitter taste in the mouths of Celtics faithful, who had dared to hope for so much more.\n\nSo what led to the unraveling of this once-promising union? Well, grab some popcorn, because it's a tale as dramatic as any Shakespearean tragedy.\n\nInjuries hit the Celtics like a wrecking ball during Irving's inaugural season in Beantown. The heart-wrenching saga began with All-Star forward Gordon Hayward's catastrophic leg injury in the very first game. Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, Irving himself went under the knife for a season-ending knee surgery barely a week before the playoffs.\n\nYet, against all odds, the Celtics battled their way to Game 7 of the 2018 Eastern Conference Finals, sans their two marquee players. It was a testament to the emerging talents of rookies like Jayson Tatum and sophomore standout Jaylen Brown, who began to showcase glimpses of their future stardom. But with newfound promise came a dilemma: too many mouths to feed on the scoring front, leading to a locker room rife with confusion.\n\nAs Irving entered the final year of his contract in the 2018-19 season, anticipation hung thick in the air. Despite opting against an early extension, he serenaded the TD Garden faithful with promises of loyalty during a preseason love-in.\n\n\"If you guys will have me back, I plan on re-signing here,\" Irving proclaimed to the adoring crowd, setting hopes soaring among Celtics die-hards.\n\nHe even went as far as envisioning his jersey hanging from the rafters, pledging allegiance to the city in a media t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate the next day. But alas, the season took an unforeseen turn, akin to a rollercoaster careening off its tracks.\n\nIrving's patience wore thin like an old sweater as frustrations mounted. He bemoaned the lack of veteran presence on the roster after a rocky start to the season, before unleashing a pointed tirade at the younger players in a memorable postgame presser.\n\nBy February, any semblance of a love affair with Boston had evaporated faster than snow in July. \"I'm going to do what's best for my career,\" declared Irving, the once-sainted star now unapologetically prioritizing personal ambition over team loyalty.\n\nWith a lackluster playoff performance culminating in a premature exit, the writing on the wall glowed with neon certainty: Irving's tenure in Boston was as good as over. He later attributed his tumultuous season to off-court distractions, including a family tragedy.\n\nBut forgiveness from Celtics fans? That seems about as likely as a snowball fight in July. The wounds of broken promises and dashed hopes run deep in the veins of Boston faithful, a stark reminder that in the NBA, loyalty can be as fleeting as a summer breeze.\n\nWell, it didn't take a hoops aficionado to see that Irving and the Celtics were about as compatible as oil and water after the 2019 NBA Playoffs.\n\nIn a move that surprised approximately zero people, the mercurial guard wasted no time in backtracking on his earlier pledges of eternal devotion to Boston. As soon as the free agency floodgates swung open, Irving swiftly inked a lucrative four-year, $141 million deal with the Brooklyn Nets, linking up with his buddy Kevin Durant to form a formidable dynamic duo.\n\nThe seismic shift in the NBA landscape was encapsulated in a single tweet from the oracle of basketball news himself, Adrian Wojnarowski, sending shockwaves through the league.\n\nIrving's tenure with the Nets lasted a respectable three and a half seasons before a change of scenery beckoned. In a deadline day stunner in 2023, he found himself donning the blue and white of the Mavericks, embarking on a new chapter in his enigmatic career. And so, the saga of Kyrie Irving continued, a tale as unpredictable and compelling as any in the annals of hoops lore.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parquet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parquet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greek tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Hayward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popcorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fan (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/safeimagekit-nba-plain-0f7d1c04-b882-48af-aeeb-4bb659743cca-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

But feeling good,\" he said at media day on Wednesday. \"(It) burns inside of me, not being able to be out there. But tomorrow finally I\u00b4ll get the chance and I\u00b4m excited.\"\n\nPorzingis said he couldn\u00b4t predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29.\n\n\"I did as much as I could to prepare for this moment, but there\u00b4s nothing like game minutes and game experience that I\u00b4m going to get tomorrow,\" he said. \"It will be tough to jump into the finals like this.\"\n\nAn offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games.\n\nHe left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds, when Boston eliminated Cleveland in five games and swept the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\"Guys so far have been playing great, taking care of business, guys stepping up,\" he said, singling out Al Horford\u00b4s work at center in his absence. \"I just look forward to add more to complete the mission.\"\n\nKYRIE AND LEBRON\n\nLeBron James praised former teammate Kyrie Irving on a podcast, calling him \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nThe feeling is mutual.\n\n\"There\u00b4s a lot of gratitude there, as well,\" Irving said on Wednesday when asked if he had heard James\u00b4 comments. \"I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish.\"\n\nJames said on his podcast \"Mind the Game\" that he\u00b4s happy and proud to watch Irving in the finals, but at the same time he\u00b4s \"mad that I\u00b4m not his running mate anymore.\"\n\n\"There was nothing on a basketball floor that Kyrie couldn\u00b4t do,\" he said.\n\nIrving and James reached the finals three straight seasons with the Cavaliers, winning it all in 2016 and losing to the Warriors the following year. Then Irving requested a trade, and the relationship soured.\n\n\"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger,\" Irving said at NBA Finals media day on Wednesday. \"Now that I\u00b4m able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I\u00b4m coming from, I feel like our relationship\u00b4s different because of that now.\n\n\"(I) definitely miss him,\" Irving said. \"Just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I\u00b4m appreciative for the rest of my life.\"\n\nIrving wound up in Boston, where he also had a still-festering fallout. In previous trips back to the Garden, he has been received rudely and a similar welcome is expected for Game 1 on Thursday night.\n\nTRASH-TALKING TIM\n\nTim Hardaway Jr. couldn\u00b4t resist the chance to talk trash about his father.\n\nAsked on Wednesday what it meant for him to be playing in the NBA Finals for the first time, Hardaway said, \"It means a lot. Especially being the first of my family to do so.\" Reporters chuckled and gasped.\n\nHardaway\u00b4s father was a five-time All-Star in 13 NBA seasons and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2022. He finished in the top 10 of the NBA MVP voting three times, and also won a gold medal at the 2000 Olympics.\n\nBut he only made it as far as the conference finals once, losing with the Miami Heat to Michael Jordan\u00b4s Bulls in 1997.\n\nHardaway Jr. has never averaged 20 points in a season, like his father did five times, and his award votes have come mostly as a sixth man. But he said he had the advantage of his father\u00b4s experience.\n\n\"I wouldn\u00b4t get to this point without my dad,\" he said. \"He\u00b4s always by my side. He\u00b4s always a phone call away. He\u00b4s always supporting me, always coming to the games. He\u00b4s a phone call away when I\u00b4m struggling, when I\u00b4m not, even if I\u00b4m having great games in a stretch, he\u00b4s telling me to keep my head down, don\u00b4t stop, keep that energy, keep that flow going. And, he\u00b4s always reiterating to me: always have fun. He\u00b4s been telling me that since high school, and that\u00b4s what I\u00b4ve been trying to do my whole entire career.\n\n\"The guy has lived it and done it. So, you know, that\u00b4s that\u00b4s that\u00b4s the luxury I do have of having a father that played in this league.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sixth man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 541, "textEnd": 549}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Even so, many remember Kyrie requesting a trade after losing the 2017 Finals to the Warriors, as he seemingly didn't want to play second fiddle to LeBron anymore.\n\nNow LeBron finds himself reminiscing on the \"good old days\" that he had with his former partner in crime.\n\nEver since the two superstars broke up, the feelings of missing each other have been mutual, as Kyrie reportedly regretted forcing himself out of Cleveland after he found that the grass wasn't greener on the other side.\n\n\"We definitely would've won more championships... Me and him [LeBron] in the league together running Cleveland, and then being able to put a better team together every single year would've definitely been worth it.\" Kyrie said.\n\nThat is to say, last season LeBron and the Los Angeles Lakers sought to acquire Kyrie ahead of the trade deadline, before the Brooklyn Nets ultimately sent him to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nLeBron really wanted to reunite with his former teammate as he referenced this in an ESPN interview at the time.\n\n\"I can't sit here and say I'm not disappointed on not being able to land such a talent, but someone that I had great chemistry with, and know I got great chemistry with on the floor, that can help you win championships, in my mind, in my eyes.\"\n\nNow fast forward a year later, and the sentiment regarding Kyrie is much the same for LeBron.\n\n\"Dallas may be able to not only win the Western Conference finals, they might be able to win the whole thing,\" James stated. \"Because of that [Irving being a] wild card. ... He's the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nAfter calling Kyrie \"a wizard,\" LeBron said, \"There was nothing on the basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do.\" LeBron noted that he was happy for Kyrie, who has now made it the Finals without himself this time; however, be that as it may, Kyrie will always be missed.\n\n\"I'm so f****** mad at the same time that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nAll that is left is the memory of playing with each other. With this in mind, during the 2016 NBA Finals, LeBron and Kyrie both helped lead the Cavs back from a 3-1 deficit. In particular in Game 5, both co-stars scored 41 points a piece, and this was the first time in NBA history that two teammates scored 40+ in the same Finals game.\n\nThen during Game 7 the tandem contributed two of the most memorable moments, which were known as \"the block\" and the \"shot.\"\n\nAfter LeBron blocked Andre Iguodala's shot to keep the game tied at 89-89, Kyrie hit a step back three-pointer to help lift the Cavs over the Warriors to bring the city of Cleveland their first sports franchise championship since 1964 (ending 52-year drought).\n\nKyrie will face his former team, the Boston Celtics in the this year's 2024 NBA Finals, as Game 1 will take place Thursday, June 6 at 8:30 pm ET.", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA | NBA |  WWE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_santomauro@fanbuzz.com", "name": "Brandon Santomauro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://fanbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/IMG_0457-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 3224, "textEnd": 3230}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

It wasn't just him (Bryant), it was his family as well. They supported me unconditionally. I miss him every single day alongside the rest of the world and all the Kobe supporters around the world.\"\n\nBryant has impacted no shortage of people around the world regardless of whether or not they play basketball. He was a role model who many people looked up to. Bryant's legacy has led to further inspiration to this day.\n\nKyrie Irving clearly misses the NBA Hall of Famer. However, he is still using the lessons that Bryant taught him as the Mavericks prepare for the NBA Finals.\n\nKobe Bryant's \"superpowers\"\n\nIrving further explained how Bryant left an impact both on and off the floor.\n\n\"He held such a big presence,\" Irving continued. \"He knew what his power was. He knew what his superpowers were. And they weren't on the court every time. They were his ability to approach life, how he inspired you to continue to do extra even when you got tired. I think his life lesson has transcended basketball or any sport or any entertainment business... That's what I felt like he was teaching me, to be able to carry the torch and also know how to pass it along.\n\n\"Obviously along that journey he's won a few championships that I'm still enamored with, still chasing to a certain degree. I do want to be able to sit at that table to say that I have multiple championships and I'm a multiple champion in the best league in the world.\"\n\nKyrie Irving has plans on winning more championships. He's four victories away from becoming a multi-time champion. And there is no question that Kobe played a role in his NBA journey.\n\nKyrie Irving: \"I feel his presence everyday\"\n\nThe entire world misses Kobe Bryant. Bryant's fearless mindset made him well-respected around the league.\n\n\"He always reminds me to enjoy the journey,\" Irving said. \"The journey is the reward. Put it in perspective. There are billions of people who are gonna love you. There are billions of people that are not going to love you. I think you should make the right choice... and go with the people that support you through and through. Make them proud, make yourself proud. Everyday he walks with me in spirit. I feel his presence everyday. I'm just grateful that I got a chance to know somebody like that and I got a chance to challenge somebody like that to one-on-one... Just understanding that there are bigger things than just the game of basketball like woman empowerment.\n\n\"But also doing the little things that people don't see, meaning helping the world selflessly. I could go on and on about this, but he helped out a lot of people that no one really knows about. He did things without anyone's praise. I try to follow in that same lineage and create my own path, create my own formula to success while also commemorating his formula that he gave me.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_mistretta@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Joey Mistretta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kyrie-Irving-reveals-how-Kobe-Bryants-superpowers-inspire-him-before-NBA-Finals.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

It was one tumultuous moment of many in a tension-filled tenure with Brooklyn that ended with his trade to the Mavericks about 10 months later.\n\nHealthier and happier, as he likes to say, Irving is back on the biggest stage in his sport with the Mavs set to face the Celtics in the NBA Finals starting Thursday.\n\nThroughout the deepest playoff run for Dallas in 13 years, the reflective side of Irving has surfaced frequently, stopping short of mea culpas but making clear he's learned a lot along the way.\n\n\"I will say last time in Boston, I don't think that was the best -- not this regular season, but when we played in the playoffs and everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (stuff) a little bit -- that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level,\" Irving said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic and Irving's refusal to get vaccinated, which meant he couldn't play in home games for Brooklyn because of New York City's vaccine mandate for employees.\n\nNext was Irving's social media post of a link to a movie containing antisemitic material, which led to a suspension from the Nets and the end of his longtime business relationship with Nike.\n\nUltimately, Irving asked out of Brooklyn, and he and Durant were traded days apart last year, giving Irving a new co-star in Mavs point guard Luka Doncic.\n\nThe partial season together didn't work out for Irving and Doncic. Dallas missed the playoffs. However, the duo's first full season together is exactly what the Mavs were expecting when they pulled off general manager Nico Harrison's first blockbuster trade.\n\n\"I'm enjoying every step of the way, Irving said. \"I'm not taking anything for granted. I'm enjoying the hot weather right now. I'm enjoying the Dallas community. We talked about this early in the season, just how much I felt embraced.\"\n\nCeltics' Brown, Tatum feel better equipped\n\nJaylen Brown has a $300 million contract, and Jayson Tatum is expected to get one, too.\n\nBut, neither player seems to care who's considered Boston's best player. And with the Celtics back in the NBA Finals for the second time in three years, they have another chance to finally win a ring that has alluded them.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason.\n\nBrown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nTatum believes they've both used lessons from the 2022 NBA Finals' loss, as well as last year's conference finals loss to Miami, to grow into players more equipped to accomplish their championship goal this time around.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dallas Mavericks Boston

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn't make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-star.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jamaica Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://jamaica-star.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2024/06/05/2820492/7976776.jpg?itok=kXqOmNAV", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

For one, Kyrie Irving was in search of a team where he could lead to glory as the number one option. Another concern was that Luka Doncic was also fairly ball-dominant. A missed postseason and some adjustments from Jason Kidd later, they are four wins against the Boston Celtics away from getting another taste at the Larry O'Brien trophy.\n\nAll of those woes that were hurled at the Mavericks seemed to have dissipated. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving seemed to now take turns playing the role of tormentor against the teams that they have faced. A stacked Los Angeles Clippers squad, an energetic Oklahoma City Thunder, and a hyped-up Minnesota Timberwolves team all had to learn the same lesson. The two have surely thrived with Jason Kidd. So, the next question after this Celtics series is: will these two stay together for a long time?\n\nKyrie Irving had the answer and it sounded like a different than what he gave in front of the Celtics faithful a few years back, via SportsCenter on ESPN.\n\n\"The future is still being written. But I can tell you that with all the extensions that are going around with J. Kidd and Nico. Potentially, with Luka this summer too. I don't mind being complimentary if we're gonna continue to put this band together,\" the master of ball-handling said.\n\nUncertainty with the Mavericks\n\nIrving is not locking anything in at all. He knows that there is a lot in store for him after this postseason with the Mavericks whether they win it all or not. At the end of the day, he is choosing to focus on what is in front of them and that is this NBA Finals matchup with the Celtics.\n\n\"We have some great pieces around us. There's always those thoughts that could creep in. Those 'what-ifs' and 'what could happen.' You never know from season to season. I just like to let it play out and stay in the present moment. I am enjoying my time here and I've enjoyed my time here,\" Irving concluded.\n\nNico Harrison has already inked a deal with the Mavericks days before the finals. Now, it will just be a matter of getting both Jason Kidd and Irving to stay. They could run it back with a relatively young squad and just move around some pieces to stay competitive.\n\nAfter all, Irving is averaging 25.6 points on a 49.7% clip from all three levels of scoring. He also helps Luka Doncic facilitate such that they get the offense going. His effort in creating opportunities for his teammates has netted the Mavericks an average of 5.2 assists. Moreover, his defensive acumen has been great whether he is on the ball-handler or anticipating bad passes in lanes. This has gotten him 1.3 steals.\n\nThe numbers and fit are there. All the Mavericks have to do is convince him to stay and have a happy environment around him.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsCenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SportsCenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Mavericks-news-Kyrie-Irving-drops-huge-hint-at-future-alongside-Luka-Doncic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLeBron James was grinding his teeth as he watched Kyrie Irving take over during the 2024 playoffs. Who would not want an asset like Uncle Drew in their squad? On the latest episode of his pod, Mind the Game, with JJ Redick, James confessed that watching his Cavs champion teammate filled him with the regret that they don't wear the same team jersey anymore.\n\nHe recalled being mesmerized by Kai's abundant offensive arsenal and referred to him as \"the wizard\" when they laced it up together. Then, the 4x Finals admitted that while he is beaming with pride upon viewing his former mate's heroics, he also wishes they were hitting the hardwood as comrades,\n\n\"Sittin' here, watchin' it, I'm playing like so fu**in' happy and so proud to watch him continue his growth or whatever the case may be, and at the same time, I'm so fu**in' mad that I am not his running mate anymore.\"\n\nThe analogy enthusiast juxtaposed Irving's presence on a roster with having a 'Wild Draw 4' card in UNO. He then cited an example from the 2024 playoffs.\n\nIrving was averaging just 8 points in the first half during the Western Conference Semis but stormed with a 24-point first-half performance in the first game of the Western Conference Finals. This ability to defy set trends and mark new parameters makes him a \"wild card\".\n\nWhile lauding his incredible 2024 playoff performances, James also turned his attention to Kai's off-hand floating shot that turned out to be a buzzer-beater. The 39-year-old acknowledged that he had never seen such an unimaginable shot in his basketball career. He paid homage to the unparalleled basketball move.\n\nIn April 2024, before a pre-game warm-up, the All-time leading scorer was practicing the lefty floater accomplished by his former running mate. After nailing the shot, around the free-throw line area, LBJ shouted, \"Kyrie Irving style!\" Even after 7 years of their separation as teammates, the spirit of Kai lives on in the Lakers legend.\n\nWhile Irving has always earned laurels from his former mate, many past legends have also bestowed him with honor. In May 2024, on his Insta story, Shaquille O'Neal acknowledged a graphic highlighting how the duo of Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic eked out the second-highest combined scoring season average in NBA history, triumphing over the second-placed Kobe Bryant and Shaq.\n\nThus, he accepted that this duo could potentially overshadow his 3x championship partnership with Mamba. This speaks volumes about the status the 2016 champion has earned in basketball history.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubham_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Shubham Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer_beater", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buzzer beater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/118a191b-untitled-design-2024-06-04t233906.681.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Boston's Kristaps Porzingis is playing a former team himself, after Dallas dealt him at the 2022 trade deadline, shipping him to the Washington Wizards after deciding that he wasn't the right piece to pair with star guard Luka Doncic. \"I don't know why it didn't work out,\" Doncic said. \"We were still both young. We tried to make it work, but it just didn't work.\" ... History aside, both Irving and Porzingis are primarily concerned with helping their current teams lock up a championship for the first time in over a decade. The Mavericks' last title came in 2011, while Boston hasn't gone all the way since 2008. ... The Celtics had a golden opportunity to secure their 18th title in franchise history just two years ago, but they fell 4-2 to the Golden State Warriors in the Finals. Looking back on it now, Boston star Jayson Tatum thinks there was a silver lining in coming up short. \"It was a lesson to be learned,\" Tatum said. \"I told myself that if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the Finals, that (I'd) never take it for granted.

In the second half of the 20th century, when the fledgling NBA was coming of age, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and Red Auerbach put Boston's parquet floor on the national sports map, winning 11 championships in 13 seasons.\n\nIn subsequent decades, as the torch was passed from Russell and Sam Jones to men named Havlicek, Cowens, Maxwell, Bird, Parish, and McHale, the Celtics continued winning championships -- two in the 1970s and three more in the golden '80s. It was also in the '80s that Larry Bird and Magic Johnson teamed with Michael Jordan and commissioner David Stern to make the NBA a global entertainment entity.\n\nWhile notions of Celtic Pride and Garden Mystique have largely endured, the franchise's stretch of championship regularity stopped after Bird & Co. won their final crown on June 8, 1986.\n\nSince that day, while NBA mini-dynasties thrived then died in Los Angeles (17 total championships, same as Boston), Chicago, San Antonio, and the Bay Area, the Celtics have won only one banner -- in 2007-08 when Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen crushed the Lakers in six games.\n\nNow the Celtics are favorites to win again.\n\nCoached by 35-year-old Joe Mazzulla, the Celtics won a league-best 64 games this season and are 12-2 in the playoffs, methodically toppling tomato cans from Miami, Cleveland, and Indiana. The Celtics are talented, deep, rested, and prepared for the return of starting center Kristaps Porzingis (calf), who hasn't played since April 29. Just about everyone outside of the Dallas-Fort Worth region is picking Boston to win.\n\nTatum and Brown, superstars drafted by Danny Ainge (who learned at the foot of Auerbach), are in their seventh season together and will be playing in their second Finals. Two years ago, the Celtics led the Warriors, two games to one, before dropping the final three games to Steph Curry, Draymond Green & Co.\n\n\"We can learn from that experience being in the Finals,\" Tatum said last weekend. \"This go-around is a lot different. Obviously we've been there before, we came up short. It's a great opportunity to make it to the Finals again. You don't always get a second chance.\"\n\nThe Celtics also feature guards Jrue Holiday (who won a ring with the Bucks) and Derrick White, a pair of terrific acquisitions by president of basketball operations Brad Stevens. And let's not forget 38-year-old Al Horford, who has played in 181 career playoff games and is overdue for his first ring.\n\nThe Mavericks are a 5-seed who won only 50 regular-season games and lost two of two against Boston (the Celtics beat them by 28 in March). Dallas made some midseason trades and went 16-4 in its final 20 games, then 12-5 in the playoffs. The Mavericks' best player is 25-year-old Doncic, a Bird clone from Slovenia, guaranteed to entertain and likely to win at least one game all by himself.\n\nThe Mavericks also have Irving, the capo di tutti capi of Boston sports villains. One of the most talented all-purpose guards in NBA history (don't forget that he won a championship with LeBron James in Cleveland), Irving played only two seasons (2017-19) for the Celtics, yet managed to offend more Hub sports patrons than Bill Laimbeer, Ulf Samuelsson, and Alex Rodriguez combined.\n\nBoston fans' hatred for Irving is seemingly boundless. Bad blood was first spilled when Kyrie reneged on a pledge to re-sign with the Celtics on the eve of his second season in Green (\"I wasn't my best self,\" Irving acknowledged Monday). This triggered five years of dueling insults between Irving and New England sports fans.\n\nIn 2020, then a member of the Brooklyn Nets, Irving burned sage around the parquet floor before a regular-season game. Later that season, in a series in which the Nets eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs, Irving stomped on the Celtics' sacred midcourt logo, then was the target of a water bottle hurled from the stands. This led to Irving's charge of \"underlying racism and just treating people like they're in a human zoo.\"\n\nOne year later, Kyrie compared Boston fans to a \"scorned girlfriend,\" then flipped off the Garden crowd in the middle of a playoff joust. A few months after that, Irving offended all of humanity, retweeting an antisemitic social media post, which resulted in him getting suspended by his own team (Brooklyn's front office stated that Irving was \"unfit to be associated with the Nets\").\n\nIrving effectively set fire to the Nets' Dream Team he'd assembled (including Kevin Durant and James Harden), missed a bunch of games because he refused to get a COVID vaccination, and was eventually traded to Dallas. He has been a model citizen for Jason Kidd's Mavericks, who've won one championship (2011) in their 44-year history.\n\nThere's a playoff push to anoint Kyrie and Luka as the NBA's best backcourt of all time.\n\nThis makes for interesting debate.\n\nWarriors fans like Curry and Klay Thompson, while folks in LA can make a case for Magic Johnson and Byron Scott, or Jerry West and Gail Goodrich. Michael Jordan and Ron Harper were pretty good for the Bulls.\n\nNaturally, the Celtics have candidates. John Havlicek occasionally paired in the backcourt with Jo Jo White. Dennis Johnson and Ainge won two championships together. Ray Allen and Rajon Rondo were a good combo for a couple of seasons.\n\nGoing back further, Auerbach had four Hall of Fame guards on the same championship team for three full seasons from 1958-61. Cousy and Sam Jones, who played six seasons together, combined to win 16 rings.\n\nCousy's jersey No. 14 and Sam's No. 24 will be hanging high above courtside when the Celtics and Mavericks get started Thursday night.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell",

As Brooklyn, along with the rest of the NBA world, watches former Net Kyrie Irving try to win the 2024 NBA Finals, a new report has surfaced.\n\nPer Dave McMenamin of ESPN, the Nets received an interesting trade offer from the Los Angeles Lakers for Irving when the relationship between him and Brooklyn broke down close to the trade deadline of the 2022-23 campaign. According to what his sources told McMenamin, the Lakers offered Russell Westbrook along with first-round picks in 2027 and 2029.\n\nAt the time, the Nets were trying to negotiate a contract extension with Irving given that he was in the final year of his deal. Brooklyn wanted to retain Irving to a long-term deal that Irving wanted, but only if the contract had certain stipulations tied to how much time Irving missed.\n\nIrving did not want his contract to have any stipulations in it and when both sides couldn't come to an agreement, he requested a trade on Feb. 3 of last season and was traded to the Dallas Mavericks less than two days later. Reports at the time suggested that Irving's preferred destination was the Lakers so that he could reunite with LeBron James, but ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported shortly after the trade that Brooklyn preferred what Dallas had to offer.\n\nOn Feb. 5, 2023, the Nets traded Irving and Markieff Morris to the Mavericks for Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a 2029 unprotected first-round pick, and second-round picks in 2027 and 2029. One can wonder if the Lakers' first-round picks in 2027 and 2029 would be more valuable than Dallas' first-round pick in 2029, but that would have required Brooklyn to re-route Westbrook, whom the Lakers traded to the Utah Jazz just for him to be waived by the Jazz a little over a week later.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Dinwiddie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Dinwiddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markieff_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Markieff Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_Finney-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dorian Finney-Smith"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dYOtpDc.LpkNHl17obQqWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nets_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_725/738fbb66ced3341bcd3d0fa34ab4ea73", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-03", "textStart": 1103, "textEnd": 1109}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Luka Doncic has been the best player in the 2024 NBA Playoffs, and that must continue being the case if they want to capture their first crown since 2011. Kyrie Irving has been phenomenal for Dallas after they snagged him from the Brooklyn Nets before last year's trade deadline.\n\nIt is just not the two doing the majority of the work as trade deadline acquisitions P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford have been incredible for head coach Jason Kidd. Other organizations could have been more aggressive in acquiring these two big men, but the Mavericks took a leap of faith and now these two assets are vital cogs in their quest for an NBA Championship.\n\nThe positive remarks have been overflowing from the media and supporters about the campaign of the Mavericks as they were barely any pundits predicting them to make the finals in the preseason. Even with the plethora of fans cheering for the underdog, there is one particular fatal flaw that can hinder their championship run.\n\n*Watch NBA games LIVE with fuboTV (click for a free trial)*\n\nInability to maximize the strength of their role players\n\nFor any individual previewing this finals series, it has been constantly mentioned that the Boston Celtics are the more talented unit. They have the best top-six in the association, but one can argue that the Mavericks have the two best players in this series. Doncic and Irving have been sensational in this postseason, and both guys have proven to not fold under the pressure of playing in the NBA Finals.\n\nDoncic will still get his usual numbers in almost every outing, but there is a legitimate belief Irving can be limited scoring-wise. Irving struggled in both contests against the Celtics because they have the size to combat his strengths. Thus when Irving cannot find his rhythm, the Mavericks will search for the explosion of some role players, such as Washington, Gafford, or Derrick Lively.\n\nWith the Celtics playing a five-out style, the strategy of having Gafford or Lively patrol the paint in every possession of the game may not be effective because Kristaps Porzingis and Al Horford can shoot the three-ball with high efficiency. Moreover, the Mavericks bigs cannot hide on any of the Celtics wings because of their outstanding scoring prowess.\n\nThere could be instances wherein Washington and Maxi Kleber will be utilized in the Dallas frontcourt because of the versatility of the Celtics' bigs. Moreover, Washington's main contributions will be on his outside shooting accuracy so if he cannot find the mark from long distance, his threat on the floor will be slightly diminished.\n\nSimilar to Washington, the Mavericks' fifth starter Derrick Jones Jr. is not comfortable dribbling too many times in a possession so if the Celtics force them to attack on their own, that would spell trouble for the Mavericks.

But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games.\n\nHe left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds, when Boston eliminated Cleveland in five games and swept the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\"Guys so far have been playing great, taking care of business, guys stepping up,\" he said, singling out Al Horford's work at center in his absence. \"I just look forward to add more to complete the mission.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKYRIE AND LEBRON\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLeBron James praised former teammate Kyrie Irving on a podcast, calling him \"the most gifted player the NBA has ever seen.\"\n\nThe feeling is mutual.\n\n\"There's a lot of gratitude there, as well,\" Irving said on Wednesday when asked if he had heard James' comments. \"I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish.\"\n\nJames said on his podcast \"Mind the Game\" that he's happy and proud to watch Irving in the finals, but at the same time he's \"mad that I'm not his running mate anymore.\"\n\n\"There was nothing on a basketball floor that Kyrie couldn't do,\" he said.\n\nIrving and James reached the finals three straight seasons with the Cavaliers, winning it all in 2016 and losing to the Warriors the following year. Then Irving requested a trade, and the relationship soured.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger,\" Irving said at NBA Finals media day on Wednesday. \"Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now.\n\n\"(I) definitely miss him,\" Irving said. \"Just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life.\"\n\nIrving wound up in Boston, where he also had a still-festering fallout. In previous trips back to the Garden, he has been received rudely and a similar welcome is expected for Game 1 on Thursday night.\n\nTRASH-TALKING TIM\n\nTim Hardaway Jr. couldn't resist the chance to talk trash about his father.\n\nAsked on Wednesday what it meant for him to be playing in the NBA Finals for the first time, Hardaway said, \"It means a lot. Especially being the first of my family to do so.\" Reporters chuckled and gasped.\n\nHardaway's father was a five-time All-Star in 13 NBA seasons and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2022. He finished in the top 10 of the NBA MVP voting three times, and also won a gold medal at the 2000 Olympics.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut he only made it as far as the conference finals once, losing with the Miami Heat to Michael Jordan's Bulls in 1997.\n\nHardaway Jr. has never averaged 20 points in a season, like his father did five times, and his award votes have come mostly as a sixth man. But he said he had the advantage of his father's experience.\n\n\"I wouldn't get to this point without my dad,\" he said. \"He's always by my side. He's always a phone call away. He's always supporting me, always coming to the games. He's a phone call away when I'm struggling, when I'm not, even if I'm having great games in a stretch, he's telling me to keep my head down, don't stop, keep that energy, keep that flow going. And, he's always reiterating to me: always have fun. He's been telling me that since high school, and that's what I've been trying to do my whole entire career.\n\n\"The guy has lived it and done it. So, you know, that's that's that's the luxury I do have of having a father that played in this league.\"\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sixth man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thepeterboroughexaminer.com/content/tncms/custom/image/c7910cd6-fbf6-11ed-943a-477f8589b241.png?resize=600%2C600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 607, "textEnd": 615}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The success for Dallas was almost immediate, as it made a run to the NBA Finals in its first full season with Irving in tow.\n\nHere is how two trades nearly a decade apart made the 2024 NBA Finals possible.\n\nMORE: Why Celtics need a healthy Kristaps Porzingis to beat Mavericks\n\nDuring the 2013 offseason, the Nets looked to make a big splash ahead of their second season in Brooklyn. The solution? A blockbuster trade to acquire two-thirds of Boston's Big Three, which was breaking up after head coach Doc Rivers was traded to the Clippers.\n\nBrooklyn agreed to trade five players and four first-round picks between 2014 and 2018 in a deal centered around Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce.\n\nMORE: Why Doc Rivers left the Celtics for the Clippers\n\nGarnett and Pierce were in the twilight of their respective careers and Brooklyn did not see much team success after the trade. In 2016, Brooklyn owed Boston the third overall pick, which was used to select Brown. One year later, the Celtics acquired the No. 1 overall pick from the Nets.

Players who represent the best or most accomplished player in a franchise's history like Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwon and others are all generally looked at in a positive light by not just their own fans, but by many observers of the NBA for the way they conducted business during their time in the league.\n\nBut the players who have been the source of controversy or repeatedly caused conflict over the course of their careers are typically met with mixed reactions from fans in the here and now. With the NBA Finals beginning this week, there is no more appropriate example of this type of player than Kyrie Irving.\n\nPlaying with the Boston Celtics from 2017 until 2019, Kyrie enjoyed a solid two years on the hardwood while wearing the Celtic uniform. He was named to two All-Star teams as well as All-NBA second team during the 2018-19 season. But unfortunately, many will remember him for things other than his performance on the court.\n\nIn 2017, Irving infamously stated on a podcast that he believed the Earth was flat. Months later, he would explain that he made this declaration simply as a way to stir intellectual discussion, knowing the type of backlash he might recieve. Perhaps it truly was just a thought exercise, but Kyrie's words were still a bit unsettling, and many felt he was making a mockery of the Celtics by representing the team in this way.\n\nAnother big event during Irving's Celtics tenure that would ultimately create a rift between he and the organization in the long term was how he handled his free agency. At an open practice at TD Garden in fall 2018, Kyrie reassured the Boston home crowd that he planned to re-sign with the team next summer, assuming the organization would be open to having him back.\n\nSo of course, when he ultimately signed a four-year, $141 million deal with the Brooklyn Nets the following offseason, Celtics fans felt he had effectively gone and spit in their faces. Simply leaving the team would not have been such a big problem, but doing so after assuring your fanbase that you would not leave felt like a malicious act to those watching from a distance.\n\nThe third and final straw for fans in Boston occurred during the 2021 playoff series between the Nets and Celtics. After Game 4 at TD Garden, Irving appeared to intentionally step on the Celtics' midcourt logo, \"Lucky,\" and walk off. It was an intentional act of disrespect, and that was where the relationship between Kyrie and Boston fans seemed to boil over.\n\nEven 2008 NBA champion and Celtics legend Kevin Garnett took issue with Irving's actions, telling the guard his actions were classless. Of course, ever since his departure, and especially since this turn of events, Celtics fans have gone out of their way to express their disdain for Kyrie, with profanity-laced chants becoming a commonality whenever Irving's team visits in Boston. T-shirts reading \"Kyrie sucks\" have become normal attire at TD Garden as well.\n\nWith all that in mind, it should be of surprise to no one that fans of the Celtics will be going at Irving harder than ever with his Dallas Mavericks coming to town on Thursday night for Game 1 of the Finals. The two parties have created what seems to be a lifelong rivalry, with no true end in sight anytime soon. If Boston can take home their first championship in 16 years, it will be extra sweet for fans to see Kyrie go out with a loss in the process.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Olajuwon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Iverson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allen Iverson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Duncan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Duncan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5604,h_3152,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/18/01hzf3fv2gbke9gh2dp0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

They got length, athleticism. They have a really good starting five, good bench players. [Kristaps] Porzingis is back healthy. So yeah, they're gonna provide a good test for us. I think for us, it's just focusing on what we do. If we can kind of put aside all the stuff that comes along with being in the Finals and the distractions, really just focus on playing the way we played over the last three or four months, I feel good about our chances.\"\n\nYou played Boston around the time Washington and Gafford got here. Did you get the feeling that teams in the West that hadn't seen much of you in the season's last month were surprised at how you had jelled?\n\nHarrison: \"Yeah, I think so. I mean, we're a completely different team than we were the first time or the second time when we played the Celtics. Either time, actually. You've gone through those battles in the playoffs where you played really tough teams. Even before the playoffs, I think we won 16 of 18, something like that. We really jelled as a team and every playoff series, we continue to get better and better. I think the team that you're seeing now is way different than the team you saw in January, February.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrading for Kyrie Irving was seen as a controversial move. He's been almost the model teammate, soldier and part of the community. Has it surprised you what he's been here for the last 18 months?\n\nHarrison: \"I don't want to say it surprised me because I know Kyrie. I've known him since he was 16 years old. I know his character. I know his work ethic, his heart. I know how compassionate he is for people and how much he wants to win. I know who he is. So, the Kyrie that people were portraying, I didn't know that guy. The guy that we have, I don't want to say, I want to give him his flowers for being a great teammate and player that he's been, but also I don't know that another guy. I'm really not surprised. This is what I would expect of Kyrie.\"\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreWhat ex-NBA player says Mavs' Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving can expect from Celtics defenseWhat happened between Kyrie Irving and the Celtics?

Even if you guys don't talk everyday, there was still that connection that they were always gonna be there for you. It wasn't just him, it was his family as well. They supported me unconditionally. I miss him every single day, just alongside the rest of the world and all the Kobe supporters around the world. He held such a big presence. He knew what his power was. He knew what his superpowers were. And they weren't on the court all the time. They were his ability to approach life, how he inspired you to continue to do extra, even when you got tired. I think his life lesson has transcended basketball or any sport or any entertainment business, it really helped spark the new brains of this new generation to carry the torch. That's what I felt like he was teaching me, to be able to carry the torch and also know how to pass it along. Obviously along that journey he's won a few championships that I'm still enamored with, still chasing to a certain degree. I do want to be able to sit at that table to say that I have multiple championships and I'm a multiple champion in the best league in the world.\"\n\nThere have been rumors for years that Irving would eventually don the purple and gold like Bryant did, but even if he never suits for the Lakers, he learned well from the Black Mamba.\n\nNow back in the NBA Finals, Irving has a chance to do Bryant and all Lakers fans a favor by beating the Boston Celtics.\n\nKyrie Irving was able to learn a lot about basketball and life from Kobe Bryant and he reflected deeply on what he took away from their time together:\n\n\"He always reminds me to enjoy the journey. The journey is the reward. Put it in perspective. There are billions of people that are gonna love you. There are billions of people that are not going to love you. I think you should make the right choice to stick to your guns and go with the people that support you through and through. Make them proud, make yourself proud. Everyday he walks with me in spirit. I feel his presence everyday. I'm just grateful that I got a chance to know somebody like that and I got a chance to challenge somebody like that to one-on-one, just to pick his brain. Just understanding that there are bigger things than just the game of basketball like women empowerment. But also doing the little things that people don't see, meaning helping the world selflessly. I could go on and on about this, but he helped out a lot of people that no one really knows about. He did things without anyone's praise. I try to follow in that same lineage and create my own path, create my own formula to success while also commemorating his formula that he gave me.\"\n\nIrving's comments speak to how revered Bryant was as a player and person and anyone can take something away from the Lakers legend's approach to everything he did.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_peralta@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Matt Peralta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Southwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Southwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kobe-bryant-kyrie-irving.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

As he gets set to take center stage at the NBA Finals, it's what makes Irving perhaps the most polarizing player in the NBA.\n\nHis actions while he was with the Nets are well-documented. He became a part-time player due to his refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine. He became a prominent face of antisemitism when he promoted a movie with abhorrent anti-Jewish sentiment and messaging on his social media accounts. He refused to apologize for it until the Nets suspended him indefinitely, but added that he agreed with points made in the movie, titled \"Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America.\" Irving later deleted his apology. He shared a video about \"secret societies in America of occults\" from Alex Jones, who was ordered to pay nearly $1 billion for lying about the Sandy Hook shooting and suggesting that it was staged. He purposefully stomped and dragged his feet on the Celtics logo at TD Garden, and also gave the middle finger to a Celtics fan.\n\nAnd that was just with Brooklyn.\n\nEarlier in his career, he became a face of failure with the Celtics as the team woefully underperformed before Irving left in free agency despite promising Boston fans he was staying. That, coupled with the Nets' Big 3 era ending in disaster and his push to leave LeBron James' side after three straight Finals runs with the Cavaliers earned Irving a reputation of being a team-wrecker.\n\nAntisemite. Headache. Team destroyer. Conspiracy theorist.\n\nIrving carried all those labels before the Mavericks acquired him last year. His reputation for making the teams he joined worse only furthered as the Mavericks spiraled (and tanked) out of the playoffs last season and got off to a brutal start this season.\n\nBut as Irving finally began staying relatively quiet and focusing on basketball, he started to flourish again. And because of that, the Mavericks now find themselves in the Finals.\n\nOn the court, Irving's greatness has been undeniable. He's one of the most unique players of this generation, possessing mesmerizing abilities to beat opponents off the dribble and acrobatically finish at the rim.\n\nIn recent weeks, the conversations regarding Irving have largely focused on that -- his stellar performances. All of a sudden, many of his prior deeds have faded to the back of people's minds, and the public perception of Irving has rebounded significantly.\n\nIt feels like that discourse has been missing crucial context, however.\n\nThough he's avoided making the news for the wrong reasons lately, how much should Irving really be forgiven? Can we watch him excel without acknowledging the harm he's caused? Can we separate the player from his beliefs?\n\nThere's no way to know how much Irving still believes those views, but he's hardly shown any remorse. Quite the opposite -- he's chosen to double down on much of it.\n\nSo no, they can't be separated. Though Irving's public standing might have fluctuated, the hate he spread sticks with him. When Irving takes the court Thursday night for Game 1 against the Celtics (8:30 p.m. ET, ABC), he'll be all of those things -- an antisemite, an incredibly talented point guard, a conspiracy theorist and the Mavericks' orchestrator.\n\nIt's all connected.\n\nYankees 5, Twins 1: Luis Gil added to his legend with another six shutout innings (one hit, six strikeouts) to lead the Yankees (43-19) to their sixth straight win. As The Post's Joel Sherman wrote: \"He is making you wonder if there is going to be a third 'G' with Guidry and Gooden when it comes to magical pitching seasons.\" Gleyber Torres and Giancarlo Stanton homered, and Aaron Judge had a two-run double.\n\nHartford 5, Somerset 4: Even more important to the Yankees' big picture was what happened at their Double-A affiliate, where ace Gerrit Cole recorded 3.1 shutout innings on 45 pitches, touching 97 mph on the radar gun, in his first rehab start as he returns from an elbow injury. Cole will make additional rehab start(s), but said he's \"definitely close.\"\n\nMets 6, Nationals 3: David Peterson pitched capably into the seventh inning, Dedniel N\u00fa\u00f1ez provided some rare steady relief, Harrison Bader and Pete Alonso went deep and the Mets (26-35) now can secure their first sweep since April in Wednesday's late-afternoon series finale.\n\nLiberty 88, Sky 75: Led by a Breanna Stewart masterpiece (33 points, 14 rebounds, omnipresent defense), the Liberty improved to 8-2 overall and 2-0 in Commissioner's Cup games. Chicago's Angel Reese was ejected in the final minutes following two (very soft) technical fouls.\n\nWith Darren Waller appearing set to retire, as The Post's Paul Schwartz wrote last week, the Giants' run of futility when it comes to the third round of the NFL Draft continues. The Giants hardly have been able to find any contributors in the third round, and now can't even use those picks to trade for one.\n\nThe Giants sent a 2023 third-round pick, which they originally acquired from the Chiefs in the Kadarius Toney trade, to the Raiders in exchange for Waller. Expected to be the team's top pass-catcher last season, Waller played just 12 games and recorded 52 catches for 552 yards and one touchdown. One year later, he seems ready to walk away from football.\n\nNot exactly a good return on investment.\n\nIn terms of players they actually drafted, you could count on one hand how many the Giants picked in the third round who were became serviceable.\n\nFlott is likely to enter the season as the Giants' No. 2 cornerback, and though Hyatt had a quiet rookie year, the jury is certainly still out on his future. Carter and Hill were starters, but beyond them, it's slim pickings.\n\nWhile opponents are finding starters in the third round, the Giants keep coming up empty.\n\nDeontay Wilder was knocked out by Zhilei Zhang on Saturday in a heavyweight clash in Saudi Arabia. It marked the 38-year-old Wilder's second consecutive loss and fourth in his past five bouts. He's been dominated in his past two fights.\n\nHe hasn't yet made any decision about his future, but it seems like it should be time for Wilder to hang up the gloves.\n\nIf it is, it will close a memorable chapter in American boxing. At a time when American interest in the sport was waning, Wilder helped attract fans with an exhilarating style, knocking out 42 opponents. He would finish with a 43-4-1 record, and his knockout-to-win ratio (97.6 percent) is the highest in heavyweight history.\n\nDon't let the end of his career mar his legacy. Wilder is an all-time heavyweight great.\n\nTuesday will go down as a sordid day in the history of how betting is policed in North American sports. Here were the slips:\n\n* Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was banned from Major League Baseball for life for betting on Pirates games while he was a member of the team last season. A sad irony: Marcano did not win any of the 25 wagers he placed on the Pirates (he was on the injured list at the time).\n\n* Four other players received one-year suspensions for betting on other teams: A's reliever Michael Kelly, Diamondbacks reliever Andrew Saalfrank, Padres pitching prospect Jay Groome and Phillies infield prospect Jose Rodriguez.\n\nRead more: MLB needs to go overkill with betting warnings before a major scandal explodes\n\n* Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter Ippei Mizuhara pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud and admitted to stealing nearly $17 million from Ohtani to pay off sports betting debts.

LeBron James returns with a vengeance: Issues a serious warning to Team USA's rivals in Paris 2024\n\nLeBron James and Kyrie Irving's years in Cleveland were arguably the best in franchise history. During the four years they played together after LeBron's return to his home state, the duo achieved the franchise's only championship after overcoming a 1-3 deficit in the Finals, won three division titles, and made three consecutive trips to the Finals, establishing themselves as the kings of the East.\n\nIn a recent episode of the \"Mind the Game Pod,\" LeBron James discussed the gifts and growth of Kyrie Irving since his departure from Cleveland in 2017, following a Finals loss to the \"super\" Golden State Warriors featuring Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry. LeBron referred to Kyrie as \"the wizard,\" stating, \"There was nothing on a basketball court that Kyrie couldn't do.\" Reflecting on Kyrie's success since their split, LeBron expressed pride and happiness but also regret, saying, \"I'm so fking happy and so proud of his growth,\" yet lamenting, \"I'm so fking mad that I'm not his running mate anymore, I just remember those times.\" Their partnership on the court was indeed poetic.\n\nSince parting ways, LeBron has thrived in Los Angeles, winning his fourth championship and Finals MVP in 2020. Despite his team's subsequent struggles in a loaded and competitive Western Conference, he remains one of the top 10 players in the NBA, showcasing remarkable athleticism despite being the league's oldest player.\n\nKyrie, on the other hand, is back in the Finals for the first time since his Cleveland days, having lost with the Celtics to LeBron in the 2018 Eastern Conference Finals in a seven-game series with a rookie Jayson Tatum on his side. After just two seasons he leaves Boston for Brooklyn, where injuries and COVID-19 vaccination issues limited his playing time alongside Kevin Durant and James Harden. Last year, he joined Dallas and Luka Doncic, playing just 20 games and missing the playoffs. In the offseason, Dallas was discounted to the point where sportsbooks gave them 25/1 odds to win the Championship and look at them now, silencing the doubters.\n\nSeeing LeBron and Kyrie play together again would be incredible. The most plausible scenario would likely involve LeBron joining Dallas in his final years, as it's doubtful that Kyrie would leave Luka and Dallas after their strong season. Many fans, like myself, are truly hoping to see them reunite on the court one more time.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/2b841d06b1ca8fe53920aa3322de520d/crop/0x0/2044x1363/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/02/27/16774526625487.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

But in terms of picking your poison, Doncic and Irving are arsenic and cyanide.\n\n\"It's hard, it's hard, but it's fun,\" said Holiday, a 14-year NBA pro out of UCLA. \"They are the best scorers in the league and they have been doing it all of their careers and you can see what they have been doing in the playoffs.\n\n\"They are in a really good groove and not just scoring, but playmaking and making their team better in crucial moments and in close out games and in whatever. They have been performing very great. It is not going to be easy but it will be fun.\"\n\nThe 6-7, 230-pound Doncic nearly averaged a triple double in 70 regular-season games and was an All-NBA first selection. He averaged 37.5 minutes, 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game. In 17 playoff games against the LA Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves, Doncic averaged 41.5 minutes, 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists. Those numbers tell a story of futility for previous defenders. There is no easy way to take Doncic out of his comfort zone.\n\n\"You can try but I think Luka goes at his own pace,\" said Holiday. \"I really don't think that Luka gets sped up. You can try as much as possible but you can say the same thing about Kyrie.\n\n\"I think that's what makes them great. I think they can control their own tempo and control their own pace the way they play. Sometimes I think they get sped up a when you throw a lot at them. But again, it is two tough matchups and two tough teams to guard here.\"\n\nIrving has been an impactful player in Dallas' run to the NBA Finals. Irving appeared in 58 regular-season games, averaging 35 minutes, 25.6 points, 5.2 assist and 5.0 rebounds per game.\n\nIrving upped his court time in 17 postseason games, averaging 40.2 minutes, 22.8 points, 5.2 assists and 3.9 boards per game. Irving scored 36 points in 40 minutes in the closeout game against the Timberwolves.\n\n\"They are two completely different players but they are some of the best guards in the NBA so it is going to be a challenge,\" said White. \"Luka has the size and physicality and Kyrie with his creativity.\n\n\"It is definitely a challenge and it is a lot of different guys thrown at them and a lot of different matchups and you just have to take the challenge. Honestly, they (the officials) are going to let you be a little more physical and you've got to take advantage of that anyway you can.\n\n\"They are both too good not to. So, no matter how the game is called, the playoffs have always been more physical than the regular season. You just have to up your physicality and do a little bit more every time. That's the playoffs and that makes sense.\"\n\nBoston Celtics President of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens had a contender in need of a booster shot after the team's disappointing second round exit from the 2023 playoffs.\n\nStevens' two key offseason acquisitions were Holiday and center Kristaps Porzingis, who should be available for Game 1 after missing the last 10 playoff games with a calf strain. Holiday has extensive playoff experienced and won the NBA title with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2021.\n\n\"It takes everything,\" said Holiday. \"I literally say it takes everything and I think it is one of the hardest things that I have ever done.\n\n\"Mentally and physically, you are exhausted. The teams know each other so well that at this point it is kind of about making plays and it is about executing. But for me, it was about how exhausted I was because I left everything out there.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rich_thompson@bostonherald.com", "name": "Rich Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lticsnl011_822b7b.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Don't overthink it.\"\n\nMaybe the hecklers won't be as hostile toward his teammates, save for Luka Doncic, but the anticipated venom against Irving, one of Boston's most hated villains, will likely be as advertised.\n\nIrving has earned the wrath of the locals for numerous reasons. Of late, when he initially returned to Boston with the Brooklyn Nets, he didn't exactly heed his breathing advice. He flipped off fans after getting booed and heckled. He also stomped on the leprechaun logo at center court.\n\nEven with a history of letting it get under his skin, Irving plans on remaining undaunted. He intends to use the boos as fuel.\n\n\"It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball,\" he said. \"The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nAs for Doncic, who didn't ignore the noise and posted 20 first quarter points while trash-talking with an unruly Minnesota fan in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals, he has a pretty good idea what he and Irving are in for.\n\nBut instead of claiming the hoots aren't all that hostile, Doncic chose the route of killing the fans with kindness, and acknowledging how hard it is to play in Boston.\n\n\"I think it's very loud crowd.

Until Carter's hard foul/assault of Caitlin Clark set off a race war across the WNBA.\n\nMillions of Girl Dads across the color spectrum were magically transformed into unrepentant racists overnight because they did not start watching the WNBA until this season.\n\nAlong with nearly everyone else.\n\nSame goes for my fellow degenerates who never bet on women's basketball until this past March.\n\nClark is a minority in the WNBA - a white woman from the corn-fed Midwest.\n\nBut she can never be a victim.\n\nInstead, she has unwittingly become the new sports face of White Supremacy.\n\nThat's a role long reserved in the national media for the likes of the late, great Donnie \"The Celtics are the balls\" Beardsley. Those of Donnie's ilk - a middle class Greater Boston guy who met his wife at a St. Patrick's Day parade in Medford, according to former Herald columnist Steve Buckley - have for too long unfairly been a stereotypical sports fan villain for everyone west of Pittsfield.\n\nThe yawning gap between the end of the Eastern Conference Finals and the start of the NBA Finals Thursday night was supposed to be the time when The Usual Suspects rolled out the stale tropes about how the state of race relations in Boston hasn't changed since Louise Day Hicks took on Judge Garrity.\n\nOr Charles Stuart killed his wife and then \"committed suicide\" by \"jumping\" off the Tobin Bridge.\n\nThe would-be tropers never got their invite to Mayor Wu's \"Electeds of Color Holiday Party.\"\n\nAny tangible marker of progress does not matter when the \"Boston Is Racist\" narrative is at stake.\n\nOne fan threw a water bottle at Kyrie Irving two years ago.\n\nBoom. It's that 70s show all over again.\n\nNone of this would be tangible if it weren't for the genuine adoration Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum feel for their former teammate. Tatum shushed the Boston crowd back in 2022 when it jeered Irving during a Celtics-Nets game.\n\nThe moment either one of the Jays backs Irving to the chagrin of their own fan base, this series is over, Sun Tzu would say.\n\nThese Finals are their final exam.\n\nCan the Jays step on the throat of their basketball BFF and deliver a championship?\n\nWill they be able to see through Kyrie's smoke and focus on the task at hand?\n\nWhy doesn't Deuce wear a helmet when he's riding his bike?\n\nLost amid this looming grotesque race card is the Texas-sized irony that the Celtics are playing a team from Dallas.\n\nDallas.\n\nIt never goes away. In 2017, Adam Jones claims he was called \"the N-word a handful of times\" during a game at Fenway Park. One fan was ejected for throwing a bag of peanuts toward Jones.\n\nSeven years later, there remains no eyewitness account, no corroboration, no audio, no video of any racist verbiage spewed toward Jones. Jones could never say during which inning(s) he allegedly heard those taunts.\n\nThe one \"witness\" turned out to be a teen-aged prankster. That didn't stop Mike Lupica from reciting his claims.\n\nThe Fenway Faithful gave Jones a standing ovation the next night.\n\nThey said Little League baseball \"disproportionately\" benefited boys over girls when they temporarily cut funding to those teams,\n\nThey gave away Mookie Betts - their best Black player - for a bag of nothing.\n\nAnd they had more \"Black Lives Matter\" banners in Fenway Park than Black players (Zero) on their Opening Day 2021 roster.\n\nIrving is just one 4-for-25 performance away from playing the race card, as he has done in the past.\n\nAnd it doesn't have to be real, especially in a time of AI fakes and social media misinformation. Or local teams willing to believe the worst about their own fans without any evidence.\n\nKendrick Perkins is one of many who believes the Celtics fans are incapable of acting like adults.\n\n\"You can boo him, (but) before it's taking it over the top, leave that man alone,\" Perkins warned.\n\nKyrie's mind-games are next-level. Monday, he spoke about his transformation since flipping off the same fans to whom he once promised to never leave.\n\n\"Everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s -- a little bit - that wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level.\"\n\nKyrie underwent a full emotional and spiritual 180 in just two years. Yet, it will be 1974 all over again the moment someone inside TD Garden fires an f-bomb in Kyrie's direction?\n\nDon't buy it.\n\n\"A little bit more grace could have been extended my way, especially what I was dealing with during that time as a human being,\" Irving said. \"I think I'm better at consolidating kind of the emotions now or being aware of what it's going to be like.\"\n\nIt's not you, Kyrie. It's me. And everyone else.\n\nIrving also delivered a pre-emptive Brady-level passive-aggressive excuse for losing.\n\n\"We call it animosity, we call it hate, we call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.' I mean, there are real, live circumstances going on in the world that are bigger than the basketball, kind of the competitive side of things and answering those questions,\" Irving said.\n\nSorry. But when you are playing for an NBA team during the NBA Finals, there is nothing bigger than the basketball.\n\nWhether you're Kyrie Irving, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, or anyone else on the court.\n\nNo matter the distraction.

Watching the Mavericks and Celtics compete for a title just adds to the pain.\n\nHighlights The Celtics-Nets trade led to Boston's success with Tatum and Brown, while Brooklyn spiraled into failure. Brooklyn's attempt at forming a superteam with Irving, Durant, and Harden ended in injuries and disappointment. Dallas reaps the benefits of Brooklyn's ill-fated trades, pairing Irving with Don\u010di\u0107 for a shot at the championship.\n\nThe Boston Celtics will face off against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals, giving fans a thrilling matchup with plenty of intriguing storylines as well as incredible basketball. Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving conclude their surprising run through the NBA Playoffs by facing off with usual participants Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, as both franchises look to break through for the first time in over a decade.\n\nKristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is battles his former team, with whom he had less than a cordial exit, Grant Williams watches as his two former squads compete for a championship, and Boston can retake their NBA lead in titles with an 18th ring. Joe Mazzulla and Jason Kidd can prove themselves as head coaches by winning this series, and a number of growing legends can claim their first ring.\n\nHowever, among all of these awesome storylines is maybe the biggest one: the Brooklyn Nets facilitated all of this with two franchise-crippling trades. Boston and Dallas will continue to reap the benefits for years to come, and this is just the first big moment.\n\nBrooklyn Swapped Two Valuable Draft Picks For Boston's Aging Stars Nets never won anything with Garnett and Pierce, while Boston landed Tatum and Brown\n\nOn June 27, 2013, the Boston Celtics called it quits on the Kevin Garnett/Paul Pierce era after a first-round exit in that year's playoffs. Little did they know that this trade would completely change the next two decades of Celtics basketball because of two of the draft picks that Brooklyn sent in exchange for the two NBA legends.\n\nKeith Bogans, Kris Humphries, and Gerald Wallace were all a part of the deal, but never made any impact in Boston. This doesn't matter to Celtics' fans at all, because the aforementioned picks turned into Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in the 2016 and 2017 drafts.\n\nSince Brown came into the league in 2016, Boston has been the NBA's most consistent franchise, posting the most playoff wins (73) in that timespan. Only the Golden State Warriors have been better, with 68 playoff wins and three titles in that period, but Boston has been even more consistently good over the last eight years, never missing the playoffs.\n\nComparing Two Franchises (Since 2014)\n\nTeam\n\nCeltics\n\nNets\n\nPlayoff Wins\n\n73\n\n15\n\nPlayoff Series Wins\n\n15\n\n2\n\nWin %\n\n.649\n\n.462\n\nPlayoff Appearances\n\n10\n\n7\n\nThe Celtics have been to six Eastern Conference Finals in Brown's eight seasons, two NBA Finals, and have won 64.9 percent of their games, which is by far the league's best. Although Boston catches a lot of flak from fans and media for failing to finish the job in any of these playoff runs, they've been knocking on the door ever since Brown and Tatum came to the franchise, and now have a chance to silence all the doubters by beating Dallas.\n\nTrading Kyrie Irving To Dallas Changed The Franchise's Outlook The deal marked the end of another failed experiment for Brooklyn\n\nAs if one disappointing recent superteam era wasn't enough, the Nets endured another failed attempt at building a winner with impulsive moves during the early 2020s. Signing Irving and Kevin Durant as well as acquiring James Harden in a trade built one of the best offensive big threes the league has ever seen, and unlike the Garnett/Pierce pairing, all three players were in their primes.\n\nHowever, injuries ruined the one good season these guys had together, ending in a seven-game second-round defeat to the future-champion Milwaukee Bucks. Both Irving and Harden were badly hurt in that series, and Durant's superhuman efforts couldn't save Brooklyn, as his \"foot on the line\" shot would go down in infamy.\n\nWhat Could've Been\n\nPlayer\n\nPPG\n\nAPG\n\nTS%\n\nRecord\n\nIrving\n\n27.1\n\n5.8\n\n60.4%\n\n82-61\n\nDurant\n\n29.0\n\n5.8\n\n65.4%\n\n85-44\n\nHarden\n\n23.4\n\n10.5\n\n59.5%\n\n55-25\n\n*This table shows the stats for Durant, Irving, and Harden in their short time in Brooklyn\n\nChemistry issues led to Harden's immediate exit in 2021-22, Irving's contract dispute with ownership led to his trade to Dallas, and Durant left shortly after, ending the experiment in bitter fashion.\n\nIrving's arrival in Dallas was a rocky one, as the Mavericks fell from the fourth seed to out of the playoffs in just two months, and his partnership with Don\u010di\u0107 seemed uncertain. Just one year later, the duo looks like the second-coming of LeBron James and Irving himself, with two unstoppable offensive players dominating the playoff stage on their way to the Finals.\n\nKyrie's scoring excellence has allowed Don\u010di\u0107 to save some energy for the defensive end and be a better overall player after years of carrying undermanned rosters to respectable playoff efforts. Those within the Dallas organization began to wonder whether Don\u010di\u0107 would request a trade in the coming years if the Mavericks couldn't provide him with adequate help, but they clearly addressed that issue.\n\nDallas is now just four wins away from hoisting the trophy, all thanks to Brooklyn.\n\nBrooklyn Never Accomplished Anything From These Trades After little playoff success, the Nets are in a difficult position for the future\n\nThe worst part for Brooklyn fans watching the success of the two squads they helped build is that their own team is stuck in the worst place possible. They have very few draft picks left because of moves like the Harden trade, only a couple of valuable young players, and no direction for the future. Trading Mikal Bridges seems like the only way to kickstart what will be a very long and painful rebuild.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Garnett and Pierce era in Brooklyn never got off the ground, as both players were well past their prime and very injury prone. Pierce exited after just one season, while Garnett stayed for two, and both years ended in disappointing postseason defeats.\n\nWashed Up Stars\n\nPlayer\n\nPPG\n\nRPG\n\nTS%\n\nGP\n\nGarnett (2 seasons)\n\n6.6\n\n6.7\n\n47.6%\n\n96\n\nPierce (1 season)\n\n13.5\n\n4.6\n\n59.5%\n\n75\n\nAfter several years in the darkness, the Durant/Irving period came up short and ended quickly, leaving the franchise in a very tough position. The spot Brooklyn finds themselves in should be a warning to the rest of the NBA to avoid building teams through quick, impulsive moves rather than by drafting and developing players and making well-timed additions to the roster. Nets fans are in for a rough few years.\n\nRelated Kyrie Irving Says He's Grown Since Last Playoff Matchup With Celtics Kyrie Irving is going up against his old team in the NBA Finals, but he's a new

Enter the latest whopper of a story from Yahoo! Sports' Jake Fischer, who is reporting that Kyrie Irving had the Timberwolves on a short list of teams he wanted to be traded to in 2018.\n\nAccording to multiple sources familiar with the matter, Irving's then-agent, Jeffrey Wechsler, informed Gilbert that his client preferred to be dealt to either the Spurs, Knicks, Timberwolves or Heat, with the list intentionally excluding the Celtics -- the franchise Cleveland had just faced in Eastern Conference finals. And once Wechsler secured permission from Gilbert to contact opposing teams, sources said, he and then-Celtics president Danny Ainge engaged in frequent dialogue about Irving's trade market.\n\nIrving wound up being traded to Boston and the rest is history. He's now preparing to face the Celtics in the NBA Finals after he and Luka Doncic roared through the Timberwolves in the Western Conference finals.\n\nIrving has always been closely connected to Minnesota. He was the No. 1 overall pick by the Cavaliers in 2011 after Cleveland won the lottery on a 2.8% chance to do so. The Timberwolves had a 25% chance to win the No. 1 overall pick that year but wound up at No. 2, where they drafted Derrick Williams.\n\nWho knows where the Timberwolves would've gone had they drafted Irving to pair with Kevin Love in 2011. But it's possible that the result of not getting Irving and then not trading for him in 2018 allowed Minnesota to be bad enough to draft Anthony Edwards in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ainge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Williams_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Williams (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Love", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Resources", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Resources/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Resources/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5376,h_3024,x_0,y_424/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_timberwolves/01hzmz301sefvaa9hvwf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Maybe the books are right. Maybe Boston has been the best team all season and will validate that status with authority over the next few weeks. Personally, I don't think it will play that way.\n\nI think the Mavericks win in seven, but in either case, whether Dallas or Boston ultimately hoists the Larry O'Brien Trophy, I expect the series to be extremely close. One of my bold predictions, in fact, is that at least six of these games will meet the \"clutch\" standard, meaning they will be within five points at some point within the final five minutes.\n\nWhich is to say, this series will be decided in closing time. It is through this prism that I'm leaning Dallas courtesy of the late-game magic of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, who are -- are you ready for this? -- a combined 7 for 9 in their postseason careers (Luka 4 for 5, Kyrie 3 for 4) on game-tying/go-ahead shots inside the final minute.\n\nThis includes Irving's Game 7 magic in the 2016 Finals, which might very well go down as the biggest shot in history.\n\nTrim the clock down to the final 24 seconds to either tie or take the lead, and these two literally haven't missed. Irving has taken just one of these shots in his playoff career, finishing a layup to tie the game vs. Boston with 11 seconds to play in Game 3 of the 2017 Eastern Conference finals.\n\nDoncic, meanwhile, has taken three of these shots over the course of his young career, and he's drained every one of them. That ties him for the most makes on such shots without a miss by any player in the last 25 years (Trae Young is also 3 for 3). His library includes the first-round buzzer beater to stun the Clippers in the 2020 bubble ...\n\nAnd his most recent game-winner over Rudy Gobert in Game 2 of this year's Western Conference finals ...\n\nThese are career shots, so disregard what might look like a small sample size. Shots like this -- even the opportunities, let alone the actual makes -- don't come along often, and the fact that Luka and Kyrie are 7 for 9 inside the final minute on do-or-die looks is preposterous.\n\nStretch it out to game-tying/go-ahead shots inside the final two minutes of a playoff game, and Luka's 58% clip (14 for 24), including 50% (6 for 12) on 3s, blows every active player who has taken at least 20 of these shots out of the water.\n\nAs for Irving, well, let's forget the numbers for a second. Earlier this year, Andre Iguodala, one of the greatest perimeter defenders ever, was asked who he fears the most at the end of a game. He didn't hesitate to say Kyrie, adding that it's \"not even close.\"\n\nIndeed, Luka and Kyrie's collective clutch gene is undisputed, but it is not, interestingly enough, entirely unrivaled when it comes to Boston's own superstar duo. You wouldn't think that was the case with the manner in which Jayson Tatum, especially, and Jaylen Brown get criticized for their late-game execution, but just look at the numbers for game-tying/go-ahead shots.\n\nPLAYOFFS ONLY\n\nFinal 24 seconds\n\nFinal minute\n\nLuka Doncic\n\n100% (3 for 3)\n\n80% (4 for 5)\n\nKyrie Irving\n\n100% (1 for 1)\n\n75% (3 for 4)\n\nJaylen Brown\n\n75% (3 for 4)\n\n50% (3 for 6)\n\nJayson Tatum\n\n40% (2 for 5)\n\n46% (5 for 11)\n\nAs you can see, Tatum has actually made more game-tying/go-ahead shots in the playoffs inside the final minute than any of these guys. He actually finished one over Irving to win Game 1 of the Celtics/Nets 2022 first-round series.\n\nFactoring in his registering more than twice the volume of Doncic or Irving, for Tatum to make nearly half of his shots in these postseason situations is quite impressive, and Brown, who sunk the game-tying corner 3 to send Game 1 of this year's conference finals to overtime, is right there with everyone else.\n\nIn fact, when you expand the criteria to both regular season and playoffs, it's Brown who comes out on top from a percentage standpoint, and all four are in the same ballpark.\n\nGame-tying/go-ahead shots\n\nFinal 24 seconds\n\nFinal minute\n\nLuka Doncic\n\n37% (15 for 41)\n\n40% (23 for 58)\n\nKyrie Irving\n\n37% (22 for 59)\n\n40% (40 for 101)\n\nJaylen Brown\n\n41% (12 for 29)\n\n43% (19 for 44)\n\nJayson Tatum\n\n35% (17 for 49)\n\n39% (29 for 75)\n\nNow let's expand the criteria to all \"clutch\" shots, meaning when a game is within five points with five or fewer minutes to play. Again, the Boston boys are right there with the Dallas duo.\n\nCareer Clutch FG%\n\nPlayoffs\n\nPlayoffs + Regular Season\n\nLuka Doncic\n\n39%\n\n44%\n\nKyrie Irving\n\n35%\n\n44%\n\nJaylen Brown\n\n35%\n\n43%\n\nJayson Tatum\n\n40%\n\n43%\n\nFor me, this feels like a series in which possibly every game could come down to clutch time. If that's the case, which star duo are you taking to close? I'm taking Luka and Kyrie, which is why I have the Mavs in seven. It's more than the numbers, which actually look pretty ordinary so far in these playoffs (Luka 36%, Kyrie 42% on clutch shots); these two guys' veins run ice cold. I don't need a spreadsheet to confirm that.\n\nBut as you can see, anyone painting Tatum and Brown as something other than a pretty damn clutch in their own right is deceiving you, whether they know it or not.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_botkin@cbssports.com", "name": "Brad Botkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer_beater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buzzer beater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/06/5686f275-10d3-4b6c-8c3c-beb4335f5d37/thumbnail/1200x675/1b0c154a352d7ef8f5653eee74f70e00/jaylen-brown-jayson-tatum-celtics-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624468", "eventUri": "eng-9624468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

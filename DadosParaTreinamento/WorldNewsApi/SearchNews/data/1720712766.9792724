Ali Farren from the 100% Redress Party topped the polls in the Carndonagh LEA with 2,253 votes, comfortably exceeding the 1,588 quota to be elected on the first count. Joy Beard, the party\u2019s candidate in the Buncrana LEA, was elected on the first count with 1,587 first preference votes. Speaking to The Journal, Farren said: From a small acorn, mighty oaks grow \u2013 that\u2019s what the 100% Redress Party is doing here in Donegal. \u201cWe were formed eight months ago, and now we have two elected councillors. A powerful result today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people have spoken. We have two schemes that are not fit for purpose and we need a better scheme.\u201d The party is hoping that its other candidates can also win seats as the counting continues across Donegal, with party chairman Tomas Devine polling well in the Letterkenny LEA. \u00c9amonn Jackson, the former chair of the Mica Action Group, is contesting the Milford LEA, healthcare worker Charles Ward is hoping to win a seat in Lifford-Stranorlar and Denis McGee is standing in the Glenties LEA. The 100% Redress Party, which was formed last year, has been campaigning to secure \u201ca genuine 100% redress scheme for all those affected by defective concrete products\u201d. The mica scandal first made headlines in 2021 when homeowners saw concrete blocks used to build their homes and were beginning to crumble. The government introduced a scheme in November 2021 to support affected homeowners to remediate their home, with the scheme being enhanced last summer. The Enhanced Defective Blocks Scheme allows affected homeowners in counties Clare, Donegal, Limerick, and Mayo to apply for a maximum grant of \u20ac420,000. Sligo is also set to be added to the scheme. Farren previously told The Journal that the party was formed because the candidates felt \u201cthere was nobody being a real, true voice for us\u201d. \u201cWe believe in the democratic way. If we\u2019re successful, we will have a voice at a council table, and we will consider running candidates \u2013 provided we get a good enough vote \u2013 for the D\u00e1il elections,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Ali Farren topped the poll in Donegal\u2019s Carndonagh LEA, while Joy Beard was elected in the Buncrana LEA.", "url": "https://www.thejournal.ie/100-percent-mica-redress-party-local-elections-donegal-6402273-Jun2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6402273/river/?height=400&version=6403423", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:03:22", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.006}

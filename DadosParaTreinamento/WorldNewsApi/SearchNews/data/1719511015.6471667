The Dutchman went into the match rocked by reports that he would be dismissed, regardless of the result. But United\u2019s beleaguered manager made a convincing case to remain in charge as he outwitted City boss Pep Guardiola to deliver the second trophy of his turbulent two-year reign \u2013 following the League Cup last season. Now ten Hag must wait to discover his fate after insisting he had not been told if he will be axed. United\u2019s minority shareholder Jim Ratcliffe and members of the Glazer family, who are the club\u2019s owners, were present at Wembley to celebrate the team\u2019s first FA Cup triumph since 2016. But it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to save ten Hag after United finished eighth in the English Premier League \u2013 their lowest final position since 1990 \u2013 and crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage. \u201cWhen I started here, I said I\u2019m here to win, also I want to build a team. Both I\u2019m doing,\u201d ten Hag said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want me, I go anywhere else and do what I did my whole career, winning games and trophies.\u201d Asked if he had received any assurances that his job was secure, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think about this. I\u2019m in a project and we are where we want to be. We are constructing a team for the future.\u201d Shortly after the final, it was reported that United will conduct a post-season review this week, with ten Hag\u2019s future on the agenda as well. The club have been linked with former Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino, Brentford boss Thomas Frank, ex-Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel, England manager Gareth Southgate and Ipswich Town coach Kieran McKenna. It would be a major disrespect from Ratcliffe and disregard for ten Hag should the manager be sacked right after his latest achievement \u2013 akin to how things worked in the past under the unpopular Glazer ownership. Former manager Louis van Gaal was fired just two days after United\u2019s 2-1 FA Cup win over Crystal Palace in 2016. There were already signs of similarities with the Glazers when a journalist asked Ratcliffe if ten Hag\u2019s job was safe, and the 71-year-old refused to say a word, while being quickly ushered away by his right-hand man Dave Brailsford. The Glazer family had often ignored reporters and fans as well. Ratcliffe also offered ten Hag just a handshake at the trophy presentation, while embracing opposition manager Guardiola and sharing a few words with the Spaniard. The Briton, who has \u201csporting control\u201d, must now decide what to do but beating a City team who clinched an unprecedented fourth successive Premier League title was undoubtedly a feather in ten Hag\u2019s cap. The Dutchman, who ended United\u2019s six-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup last season, is the first manager to win titles in successive campaigns since Alex Ferguson. \u201cThe FA Cup was absolutely one on my bucket list. It is a huge trophy. I\u2019m so happy we won,\u201d ten Hag said. \u201cWhen I took over, it was a mess at United. Now the team is progressing. Two trophies is not bad, but I\u2019m not satisfied.\u201d Guardiola had kind words for the 54-year-old, saying he is a \u201clovely person and an extraordinary manager\u201d. He also took the blame as his side were deprived of a second successive English double. City\u2019s 35-match unbeaten run in all competitions in open play ended as first-half goals by teenagers Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo proved enough for United, despite Jeremy Doku pulling one back late on. \u201cI think my game plan was not good,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThe second half was much better. We were more intense, in part because we were 2-0 down and had nothing to lose. Disappointed but it\u2019s normal teams can lose finals. \u201cWe will rest and come back next season.\u201d \u2013 AFP, REUTERS", "summary": "<p class=\"lead\">LONDON \u2013 Erik ten Hag warned Manchester United\u2019s owners that he will carry on winning trophies elsewhere, if they decide to sack him in the aftermath of the 2-1 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City on May 25.</p>\n\n<p>The...", "url": "https://tnp.straitstimes.com/sports/football/ill-win-trophies-elsewhere-says-erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-sack-talk-lingers", "image": "https://tnp.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/rl680/public/2024-05-25T164908Z1320759636UP1EK5P1APU4ERTRMADP3SOCCER-ENGLAND-MCI-MUN-REPORT.JPG?itok=ZBW2-Zsk", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:25:51", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": -0.191}

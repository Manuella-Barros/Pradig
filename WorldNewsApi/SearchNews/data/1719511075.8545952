Posting the video of the meeting BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya stated on X-handle, \u201cPrime Minister Narendra Modi chairs meeting to review response and preparedness for cyclone Remal, which is likely to make a landfall in West Bengal, around midnight.\u201dHe added, \u201cNDRF and Navy personnel are already on ground. Modi Govt, like always, is standing with the people of West Bengal, particularly the affected districts of 24 North/South Parganas and Greater Kolkata region. But Mamata Banerjee is no where to be seen. All she wants is power but no accountability.\u201dEarlier chief minister Mamata Banerjee sent out advisories to people to stay alert. \u201cIt is raining outside. This will become random after 6 pm and will continue for a day. Don't feel scared. But take care,\u201d she told a poll campaign rally in the afternoon.Ms Banerjee added, \u201cElectric poles have to be taken care of. If power cut happens, don't worry. We have arranged generators but repair takes time. Such storms happen every year. When it happens, don't switch on the TV and AC. Except emergency lights, keep others switched off.\u201dHer MP nephew Abhishek Banerjee also directed all Trinamul Congress workers to reach out to the people. He said, \u201cDuring these hard times, you will find AITC leaders on ground working day & night to help you, taking affected ones to relief camps, providing essential relief materials just like Duare Sarkar camps when TMC workers helped with forms and other necessary requirements. We have made all the arrangements in South 24 Parganas. We want to help all the people of different age groups. I would request Party workers to be on the ground and help everyone.\u201dMeanwhile rain coupled with a storm has hit Kolkata and adjoining districts. At Nagerbazar in Dum Dum, trees got uprooted while a shed at the Tollygunge metro station was damaged affecting metro services.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/pm-modi-reviews-cyclone-remal-preparedness-895857", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/02/28/1077582-narendramodi.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:52:51", "author": "Rajib Chowdhuri", "authors": ["Rajib Chowdhuri"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.026}

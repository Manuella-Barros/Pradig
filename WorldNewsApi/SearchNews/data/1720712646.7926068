{"id": 232068042, "title": "Taylor Swift being 'driven in Beast-like' armoured car for UK tour", "text": "She once sang that she would one day \"be so big that you can\u2019t hit me,\" and now Taylor Swift is enjoying protection worthy of a president on her world tour. The singer is reportedly being chauffeured in an armoured \u00a31 million Mercedes V Class, capable of withstanding bullets and bombs. Swift is known for her differing opinions with Donald Trump, but they do share a similar taste in vehicles. The former president's Cadillac One, now used by Joe Biden, is so heavily secured it has earned the nickname \"The Beast.\" Swift\u2019s personnel have been seen driving her in a similarly secure V Class for her Eras Tour as it arrived in the UK this week, the Sun has reported. She opened her British account with a sold out show at Edinburgh\u2019s Murrayfield on Friday and will also play Liverpool, Cardiff, and Dublin as well as eight nights at Wembley Stadium. The tour, which takes fans on a journey through the different musical stages of her career, has already been a juggernaut and is predicted to provide a \u00a3997 million boost to the UK economy. The Wembley dates are June 21, 22 and 23, and August 15, 16, 17, 19 and 20. Swift is known to be safety conscious, especially in the aftermath of the tragedy of Ariana Grande\u2019s Manchester concert in 2017. \u201cAfter the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was terrified to go on tour this time because I didn\u2019t know how we were going to keep three million fans safe over seven months,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a tremendous amount of planning, expense and effort put into keeping fans safe. \u201cMy fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds.\u201d UK and Irish fans will be treated to a significantly different show to that seen in the US leg. Swift has overhauled her setlist, staging and costumes following the release of her latest album The Tortured Poets Department.", "summary": "<p>Reports that car is similar to one popularised by Donald Trump</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/taylor-swift-being-driven-in-beastlike-armoured-car-for-uk-tour-b1163160.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/07/21/007c51395572cf0f3ad0bb9d16334af8Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3ODc5NzEx-2.76446641.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/oEzQptO3-MzYL9J7h.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:08:55", "author": "William Mata", "authors": ["William Mata"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.055}

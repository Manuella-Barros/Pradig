During an interview for Variety's \"Know Their Lines\" video series, Bloom blanked on one of the lines said by his \"Troy\" character Paris (he thought it must be from \"Kingdom of Heaven\" or \"Lord of the Rings\") and admitted that he has mostly blocked the movie out of his mind.\n\n\"Oh my god, 'Troy.'

I think that's why I blanked that from my mind.\"\n\n\"Troy\" opened in summer 2004 and grossed nearly $500 million at the worldwide box office. Loosely based on Homer's \"Iliad,\" the film featured a sprawling cast that included Bloom, Pitt, Bana, O'Toole, Diane Kruger, Brian Cox, Sean Bean, Brendan Gleeson and more. Bloom's character, Paris, is the Prince of Troy whose affair with Queen Helen (Kruger) ignites the Trojan War.\n\nKruger made headlines last fall for saying the making of \"Troy\" was \"exhilarating, but it was a circus. The sets were huge, paparazzi were flying around in a helicopter, waiting for Brad Pitt. It was crazy! When the movie was coming out, the press in Germany was very, very tough on me. They found my father, whom I haven't seen since I was 13. They made up stories. It was really harsh.\"\n\nThe actor added that by time the film premiered in Cannes, she was feeling \"very insecure and very sad.\"\n\n\"I was thinking: 'Is that what it's going to be like, forever? I can't deal with it.' Brad could see I was upset,\" she added. \"He came to my room and said: 'I have heard some things and I want you to know that you are one of us now. Don't let them get to you.' He was so incredibly kind.

The movie was a box office success, but it hasn't really stood the test of time as a good film. Troy marks one of Bloom's last non-franchise blockbusters.\n\nTroy star Orlando Bloom candidly reflects on his experience filming the 2004 film. Directed by Wolfgang Peterson, Troy chronicles the infamous sacking of the titular city by the Greeks in 1250 BCE. The film, which stars Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Brian Cox, Eric Bana, and Sean Bean, features Bloom in the role of Paris, the Prince of Troy and younger brother to Bana's Hector.\n\nIn a recent interview for Variety's \"Know Their Lines\" video series, Bloom struggles to identify one of his character's lines from Troy, ultimately revealing that he doesn't look back at his time in the movie fondly. According to the actor, he just couldn't relate to the character he was playing. Check out Bloom's full comment below:\n\n\"Oh my god, 'Troy.' Wow. I think I just blanked that movie out of my brain by the way. So many people love that movie, but for me playing that character was just like [slits throat]. Am I allowed to say all of these things? I didn't want to do the movie. I didn't want to play this character.\n\n\"The movie was great. It was Brad [Pitt]. It was Eric [Bana] and Peter O'Toole. But how am I going to play this character? It was completely against everything I felt in my being.\n\n\"At one point it says Paris crawls along the floor having been beaten by somebody and holds his brother's leg. I was like, 'I'm not going to be able to do this.' One of my agents at the time said, 'But that's the moment that will make it!' And I completely fell for that line of a agent. I think that's why I blanked that from my mind.\"\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nWas Troy Worth The Struggle For Orlando Bloom?\n\nThe Movie Failed To Make A Lasting Impact\n\nWhile Troy may have been a challenge for Bloom and not a project he enjoyed, it could certainly be worth it if it had a measurably positive impact on his career. The reviews for Troy, however, were mixed at best, with critics mostly agreeing that there's little substance beneath all the movie's spectacle. As a result, the film currently has a lackluster score of 53% on Rotten Tomatoes. The audience score, however, is higher at 73%.\n\nDespite a less-than-stellar reception, Troy was a box office hit. The movie grossed close to $500 million worldwide, with the spectacle and star power of figures like Pitt, Bana, and Bloom evidently a draw. Despite this, however, the movie hasn't really lived on in popular culture. Gladiator, for example, another sword-and-sandal-type movie, made a little less than Troy at the box office, but it has clearly stood the test of time far more effectively and is looked back upon with more reverence.\n\nSpeaking to Gladiator's enduring popularity, Ridley Scott's Gladiator 2 is due out later this year.\n\nIt's unclear if Troy's box office success opened any doors for Bloom, but the actor was already a recognizable star at the time due to his roles in The Lord of the Rings and the first Pirates of the Caribbean. The mixed reception to Troy and the box office underperformance of Kingdom of Heaven the next year, which Bloom also stars in, might actually explain why the actor's biggest hits in the years afterward are almost exclusively Pirates of the Caribbean and The Hobbit sequels. In any case, Bloom is clearly content to leave Troy in the rearview mirror.\n\nSource: Variety\n\nTroy R Drama Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot

I didn't want to do the movie. I didn't want to play this character.\"\n\nLoosely based on Homer's Iliad, Troy follows the events of the Trojan War and features a star-studded cast that included Bloom, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole, Diane Kruger, Brian Cox, Sean Bean, and Brendan Gleeson. It is Bloom's character who incites the war when he strikes up an affair with Queen Helen (Kruger) of Sparta and then sneaks her aboard his ship home.\n\nWhile Bloom acknowledged that the movie itself was \"great\" -- specifically shouting out Pitt, Bana, and O'Toole's performances -- he admitted that it was difficult to play such a cowardly character.\n\n\"It was completely against everything I felt in my being. At one point, [the script] says, 'Paris crawls along the floor having been beaten by somebody and holds his brother's leg.' I was like, 'I'm not going to be able to do this,'\" he recalled. \"One of my agents at the time said, 'But that's the moment that will make it!' And I completely fell for that line of an agent.

Back in 2019, Pitt told the New York Times that he was \"disappointed\" by it too.\n\n\"I had to do Troy because -- I guess I can say all this now -- I pulled out of another movie and then had to do something for the studio. So I was put in Troy,\" Pitt said at the time. \"It wasn't painful, but I realized that the way that movie was being told was not how I wanted it to be. I made my own mistakes in it.\"\n\nHe explained that the film \"became a commercial kind of thing\" along the way. \"Every shot was like, here's the hero! There was no mystery,\" he added. \"So about that time I made a decision that I was only going to invest in quality stories, for lack of a better term. It was a distinct shift that led to the next decade of films.\"\n\nIn Entertainment Weekly's review, critic Lisa Schwarzbaum described Troy as \"pageant long but not deep, noisy but not stirring, expensive but not sumptuous.\" She also called out the film for stifling Bloom's performance, writing, \"As Paris, Bloom briefly reaches, Legolas-like, for a bow and arrow -- but the gesture only draws attention to the cramped space in which the stirring young actor has to work, compared with what he could make of a well-handled quiver as an elf.\"\n\nShe noted, \"In a post-LOTR age -- ye gods, in a post-Braveheart age, let alone in a contemporary time of terror, paranoia, and ceaseless skirmish -- this is not enough to warrant such trumpets and drumbeats, such Enya-like keening between tableaux of Men Behaving Beefily.\"\n\nWatch Bloom reflect on Troy and his other films in the clip above.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Bloom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Bloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bana", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Bana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Kruger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diane Kruger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Petersen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolfgang Petersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_O'Toole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter O'Toole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trojan War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iliad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Pitt the Younger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bean", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Bean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Cox (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sparta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Schwarzbaum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Schwarzbaum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mystery film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trumpet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/r1vy1NUpXh9U5CWunHyMd3yHTjs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(893x448:895x450)/Orlando-Bloom-Troy-050924-84ef3997f5e1402b856b6c5320d45d95.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554633", "eventUri": "eng-9554633", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Paris's illegal marriage to the queen of Sparta, Hellen (Kruger), after kidnapping her from her husband, Menelaus (Gleeson), is what sets off the Trojan War.\n\nIn 2022, Kruger made headlines when she admitted that during her audition for the movie, she felt \"like meat\".\n\n\"I remember testing for Troy and having to go to the studio head in costume.

She started at the brand in 2016 and has more than 15 years' professional writing experience.\n\nOrlando Bloom has a lot of love for his film career, but there's one role he'd perhaps like to forget.\n\nDuring an interview with Variety for the outlet's \"Know Their Lines\" series, the 47-year-old English actor admitted he \"didn't want to play\" the character of Paris in Troy.\n\nOne line he couldn't quite nail during the game was one he utters in the 2004 historical epic: \"Do you love me, brother? Will you protect me from any enemy?\"\n\nAfter guessing Kingdom of Heaven (2005) and the Lord of the Rings films, Bloom was surprised to learn it was from Troy.\n\n\"I think I just blanked that movie out of my brain,\" he quipped.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\nDespite the fact that \"so many people love\" Troy -- which made close to $500 million at the global box office and costarred Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Diane Kruger, among others -- Bloom said, \"For me, playing that character was just like,\" and mimed slitting his throat.\n\n\"I didn't want to do the movie,\" he continued, before clarifying, \"I didn't want to play this character. The movie was great -- it was Brad and it was Eric and it was Peter O'Toole. And I was like, 'How am I gonna play this character?' It was completely against everything I felt in my being.\"\n\nBloom recalled one specific moment in the script where Paris \"crawls along the floor, having been beaten by somebody, and just holds his brother's leg.\" It was a scene he was against doing, but an agent of his at the time told him, \"That's the moment that'll make it.\"\n\n\"And I completely fell for that line of an agent,\" he added, laughing. \"I think that's why I blanked that line from my mind.\"\n\n\"I had to do Troy because -- I guess I can say all this now -- I pulled out of another movie and then had to do something for the studio. So I was put in Troy,\" the Oscar winner admitted. \"It wasn't painful, but I realized that the way that movie was being told was not how I wanted it to be. I made my own mistakes in it.\"\n\nHe added in part, \"So about that time I made a decision that I was only going to invest in quality stories, for lack of a better term. It was a distinct shift that led to the next decade of films.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Bloom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Bloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Bana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneau,_Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneau, Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Juneau, Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Kruger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diane Kruger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_O'Toole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter O'Toole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/kiiDccmZBOW4nIX6dmXNfepNWpY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1080x233:1082x235)/orlando-bloom-in-troy-Orlando-Bloom-attends-the-UNICEF-At-75-Celebration-050924-53ef4458052a461cba74d0dac0da5047.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554633", "eventUri": "eng-9554633", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 452993288, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 8, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 8}}}

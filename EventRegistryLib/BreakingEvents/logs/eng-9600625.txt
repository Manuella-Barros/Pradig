The law, which mirrors Russian regulations, mandates media and NGOs to register as foreign agents if funded over 20% from abroad, raising concerns over media freedom and EU integration ambitions.\n\nThe president and prime minister of Georgia on Sunday lashed out at each other at a ceremony marking the country's independence day as strong tensions persist over a law that critics say will obstruct media freedom and damage Georgia's bid to join the European Union. The measure would require media and non-governmental organizations to register as \"carrying out the interests of a foreign power\" if they receive more than 20% of their budget from abroad. Opponents denounce it as \"the Russian law\" because of similar regulations there. Large protests have repeatedly been held in the capital Tbilisi as the measure made its way through parliament. After the legislature passed the bill, President Salome Zourabichvili vetoed it on May 18, but the Georgian Dream party of Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze and its backers have enough votes in parliament to override the veto. \"As the specter of Russia looms over us, partnership and rapprochement with Europe are the true path to preserving and strengthening our independence and peace. Those who sabotage and undermine this path trample upon and damage the peaceful and secure future of our country, hindering the path towards becoming a full member of the free and democratic world,\" Zourabichvili said at the ceremony celebrating the 106th anniversary of Georgia's declaration of independence from Russia. At the same ceremony, Kobakhidze lauded Georgia's development and sharply criticized Zourabichvili.\n\n\"It was the unity and reasonable steps of the people and their elected government that gave us the opportunity to maintain peace in the country for the past two years despite existential threats and multiple betrayals, including the betrayal of the president of Georgia.\" he said. In the evening, thousands of opponents of the measure marched along one of the main avenues of the capital. Some previous demonstrations against the law have brought clashes between protesters and police. The European Union's foreign policy arm has said \"the adoption of this law negatively impacts Georgia's progress on the EU path.\" Critics say it may have been driven by Russia to thwart Georgia's chances of further integrating with the West. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday announced that travel sections would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia\" and \"it remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Georgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Georgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salome_Zurabishvili", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salome Zurabishvili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Dream", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgian Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irakli_Kobakhidze", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irakli Kobakhidze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tbilisi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tbilisi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Georgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Georgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/26_05_2024_19_16_26_1496647.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9600625", "eventUri": "eng-9600625", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 1050, "textEnd": 1056}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 241, "relevance": 1}

She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and \"hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.\"\n\nThe veto was rejected by an 84-4 vote in a contentious parliament session, during which a Georgian Dream deputy doused the leader of an opposition party with water while he spoke from the rostrum.\n\nOpponents of the bill thronged outside the parliament building and some shouted \"Slaves!\" as the vote was announced.\n\nThe government says the bill is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilize the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million, but many Georgian journalists and activists argue that the bill's true goal is to stigmatize them and restrict debate ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October.\n\nOpponents denounce the legislation as \"the Russian law\" because it resembles measures pushed through by the Kremlin to crack down on independent news media, nonprofits, and activists. Critics say the measure may have been driven by Moscow to thwart Georgia's chances of further integrating with the West.\n\nPrime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, however, contended the law will aid that integration.\n\n\"The law on transparency will create better grounds for ensuring the membership of Georgia in the EU,\" he told a news conference after the vote, adding that the law would strengthen Georgia's sovereignty.\n\nBut opposition parliament member Khatia Dekanoidze said: \"Now we have an absolutely new reality. ... Probably, the window for integration into European Union will be closed.\"\n\nThe bill is nearly identical to one that the ruling party was pressured to withdraw last year after massive street protests. Renewed demonstrations again gripped Georgia as the bill made its way through parliament. Demonstrators scuffled with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy arm has said that adoption of the law \"negatively impacts Georgia's progress on the EU path.\"\n\nLast week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia.\" He noted that \"it remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\"\n\nThe EU offered Georgia candidate status last December, while making it clear that Tbilisi needs to implement key policy recommendations for its membership bid to progress.\n\nThe opposition United National Movement has described the bill as part of efforts by Georgian Dream to drag the country into Russia's sphere of influence - claims it vehemently denies. Georgian Dream was founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire who made his fortune in Russia.\n\nZuka Elbakidze, a student who was among protesters rallying in Tbilisi ahead of Tuesday's vote, said \"this day will determine the fate of our country,\" adding that \"we are making a choice between Europe and Russia, and all the people gathered here, except the policemen, want Europe and the West.\"\n\n\"We are physically witnessing, literally witnessing, how Georgian citizens, how members of the Georgian Parliament are selling out our country,\" said another protester, Mariam Geguchadze.\n\nRussia-Georgia relations have often been rocky since Georgia became independent after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow then recognized South Ossetia and another separatist province, Abkhazia, as independent states and strengthened its military presence there. Most of the world considers both regions to be parts of Georgia.\n\nTbilisi cut diplomatic ties with Moscow, and the regions' status remains a key irritant even as Russia-Georgia relations have improved in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_science_monitor@csmonitor.com", "name":

Georgian Dream was founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire who made his fortune in Russia.\n\nZuka Elbakidze, a student who was among protesters rallying in Tbilisi ahead of Tuesday's vote, said \"this day will determine the fate of our country,\" adding that \"we are making a choice between Europe and Russia, and all the people gathered here, except the policemen, want Europe and the West.\"\n\n\"We are physically witnessing, literally witnessing, how Georgian citizens, how members of the Georgian Parliament are selling out our country,\" said another protester, Mariam Geguchadze.\n\nRussia-Georgia relations have often been rocky since Georgia became independent after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow then recognized South Ossetia and another separatist province, Abkhazia, as independent states and strengthened its military presence there. Most of the world considers both regions to be parts of Georgia.\n\nTbilisi cut diplomatic ties with Moscow, and the regions' status remains a key irritant even as Russia-Georgia relations have improved in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Dream", "type": "org",

If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.\n\nThe bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as \"pursuing the interests of a foreign power\" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.\n\nZourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and \"hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.\"\n\nThe veto was rejected by an 84-4 vote in a contentious parliament session, during which a Georgian Dream deputy doused the leader of an opposition party with water while he spoke from the rostrum.\n\nThe government says the bill is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilize the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million. But many Georgian journalists and activists argue that the bill's true goal is to stigmatize them and restrict debate ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October.\n\nOpponents denounce the legislation as \"the Russian law\" because it resembles measures pushed through by the Kremlin to crack down on independent news media, nonprofits and activists. Critics say the measure may have been driven by Moscow to thwart Georgia's chances of further integrating with the West.\n\nThe bill is nearly identical to one that the ruling party was pressured to withdraw last year after massive street protests. Renewed demonstrations again gripped Georgia as the bill made its way through parliament. Demonstrators scuffled with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them. The European Union's foreign policy arm has said that the adoption of the law \"negatively impacts Georgia's progress on the EU path.\"\n\nLast week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia.\" He noted that \"it remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\"\n\nThe EU offered Georgia candidate status last December, while making it clear that Tbilisi needs to implement key policy recommendations for its membership bid to progress. The opposition United National Movement has described the bill as part of efforts by Georgian Dream to drag the country into Russia's sphere of influence - claims it vehemently denies. Georgian Dream was founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire who made his fortune in Russia.\n\nRussia-Georgia relations have often been rocky since Georgia became independent after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow then recognized South Ossetia and another separatist province, Abkhazia, as independent states and strengthened its military presence there.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe Georgian parliament has overridden a presidential veto of the \"foreign agents\" Bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests and sharp criticism from the West which says the legislation is Kremlin-inspired.\n\nThe legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, voted to ignore the objections of Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party.\n\nThe president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.\n\nThe dispute about the draft law has come to be seen as a key test of whether Georgia, for three decades among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states, would maintain its Western orientation, or pivot instead to Russia.\n\nThe bill would require organisations receiving more than 20 per cent of their funding from overseas to register as \"agents of foreign influence\", while also introducing punitive fines for violations, as well as onerous disclosure requirements.\n\nIf she does not do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.\n\nMs Zourabichvili has accused the governing party of jeopardising the country's future and \"hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world\".\n\nThe veto was rejected by an 84-4 vote in a contentious parliament session, during which a Georgian Dream deputy doused the leader of an opposition party with water while he spoke from the rostrum.\n\nOpponents of the Bill thronged outside the parliament building and some shouted \"Slaves!\" as the vote was announced.\n\nThe government says the Bill is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilise the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million, but many Georgian journalists and activists argue that the Bill's true goal is to stigmatise them and restrict debate ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October.\n\nOpponents denounce the legislation as \"the Russian law\" because it resembles measures pushed through by the Kremlin to crack down on independent news media, non-profits and activists.\n\nCritics say the measure may have been driven by Moscow to thwart Georgia's chances of further integrating with the West. The Bill is nearly identical to one that the ruling party was pressured to withdraw last year after massive street protests.\n\nRenewed demonstrations again gripped Georgia as the Bill made its way through parliament.\n\nDemonstrators scuffled with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy arm has said that adoption of the law \"negatively impacts Georgia's progress on the EU path\".\n\nLast week, US secretary of state Antony Blinken announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia\". He noted that \"it remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations\".\n\nThe EU offered Georgia candidate status last December, while making it clear that Tbilisi needs to implement key policy recommendations for its membership bid to progress.\n\nThe opposition United National Movement has described the Bill as part of efforts by Georgian Dream to drag the country into Russia's sphere of influence - claims it vehemently denies.\n\nGeorgian Dream was founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire who made his fortune in Russia.\n\nZuka Elbakidze, a student who was among protesters rallying in Tbilisi ahead of Tuesday's vote, said: \"This day will determine the fate of our country\", adding that \"we are making a choice between Europe and Russia, and all the people gathered here, except the policemen, want Europe and the West\".\n\n\"We are physically witnessing, literally witnessing, how Georgian citizens, how members of the Georgian parliament are selling out our country,\" said another protester, Mariam Geguchadze.\n\nRussia-Georgia relations have often been rocky since Georgia became independent after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia.\n\nMoscow then recognised South Ossetia and another separatist province, Abkhazia, as independent states and strengthened its military presence there. Most of the world considers both regions to be parts of Georgia.\n\nTbilisi cut diplomatic ties with Moscow, and the regions' status has remained a key irritant even as Russia-Georgia relations have improved in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Dream",

Georgia has been an official candidate country since last year and support for membership is very high among Georgians.\n\nThe bill has been met with criticism from outside Georgia too. The Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's top constitutional law body, said Tbilisi should scrap it.\n\nThe US State Department threatened Georgia with sanctions if it went ahead with the legislation and said Washington may have to rethink its relationship with Tbilisi.\n\nUS lawmakers also introduced two similar bills that seek to persuade the Georgian government to ditch the 'Russian law'. The proposed acts offer visa liberalisation and opportunities to deepen US-Georgia relations in various sectors, but sanction those responsible for Georgia's possible democratic backslide.\n\nAnd the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the law \"negatively impacts Georgia's progress on the EU path\".\n\nBut the ruling Georgian Dream party, who proposed and shelved almost identical legislation last year, says the law is necessary to maintain a national identity and promote transparency.\n\nLast week, Georgia's president followed through on her promise and vetoed the bill, calling it \"unacceptable\".\n\nZourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with Georgia's ruling party, said at the time that the law contradicts the constitution and \"all European standards.\"\n\nBut the Georgian Dream party has a majority sufficient to override Zourabichvili's veto and is widely expected to do so.\n\nAs official Independence Day celebrations wound down, Georgians continued to protest against the bill in the streets of Tbilisi.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Georgia has been an official candidate country since last year, and support for membership is very high among Georgians.\n\nThe bill has been met with criticism from outside Georgia, too. The Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's top constitutional law body, said Tbilisi should scrap it.\n\nThe US State Department threatened Georgia with sanctions if it went ahead with the legislation and said Washington may have to rethink its relationship with Tbilisi.\n\nUS lawmakers also introduced two similar bills that seek to persuade the Georgian government to ditch the \"Russian law\". The proposed acts offer visa liberalization and opportunities to deepen US-Georgia relations in various sectors but sanction those responsible for Georgia's possible democratic backslide.\n\nAnd the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the law \"negatively impacts Georgia's progress on the EU path\".\n\nHowever, the ruling Georgian Dream party, which proposed and shelved almost identical legislation last year, says the law is necessary to maintain a national identity and promote transparency.\n\nLast week, Georgia's president followed through on her promise and vetoed the bill, calling it \"unacceptable\".\n\nZourabichvili, who was increasingly at odds with Georgia's ruling party, said that the law contradicted the constitution and \"all European standards\".\n\nBut the Georgian Dream party has a majority sufficient to override Zourabichvili's veto and is widely expected to do so. -- Euronews", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title":

The law primarily targets U.S. and European Union democracy assistance programs.\n\nPresident Salome Zourabichvili vetoed the legislation on May 18, but it was widely expected that the ruling Georgian Dream party's parliamentary majority would override the veto.\n\nGeorgian Dream reintroduced the law in April, a year after it abandoned in March 2023 after it sparked mass protests.\n\nProtesters view the law as a move by the government to tilt the country toward Moscow, even though polls show more than 80% of Georgians support Georgia's path toward EU membership and 73% endorse the country's bid to join NATO.\n\nGeneral elections in October will determine whether the Georgian Dream party remains in power for a fourth term. Georgian nongovernmental organizations say the foreign agent law may hinder international organizations' ability to observe the October vote. While the government claims the law promotes transparency, local NGOs and Georgia's Western partners view it as targeting Western funding for Georgian civil society.\n\n\"Having no chances of victory in the upcoming general elections in October if they are conducted freely and fairly, [Bidzina] Ivanishvili\" -- Georgian Dream's shadow leader -- \"is tightening his grip on power through harsh authoritarian measures and is openly driving the country into Russian influence,\" former Georgian ambassador to the United States David Sikharulidze told VOA outside the parliament building in Tbilisi.\n\n\"It's very much in line with Putin's tactics,\" he said.\n\n\"This law is a Russian law in essence and spirit, which contradicts our constitution and all European standards,\" Zourabichvili said in her veto statement.\n\nZourabichvili, whose election as president in 2018 was supported by Georgian Dream, has increasingly found herself at odds with the party.\n\nApprehension over the domestic and foreign policy trajectory of Georgia's government has grown since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Official Tbilisi refused to side with Ukraine publicly or to join sanctions against Moscow, while attacking Ukrainian officials publicly and echoing anti-Western rhetoric.\n\nIn addition, U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about Georgia's role in helping Russia evade Western sanctions.\n\nFor more than a month and a half, tens of thousands of Georgians have taken to the streets to protest the foreign agent law, the largest protests the country has seen since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\n\"Georgian people have erupted in protest. They deserve more than just statements from the Western partners,\" Sikharulidze said.\n\nLast week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced sanctions against those \"responsible for undermining democracy in Georgia.\"\n\n\"The Department of State is implementing a new visa restriction policy for Georgia that will apply to individuals who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members,\" Blinken said in a statement. \"This includes individuals responsible for suppressing civil society and freedom of peaceful assembly in Georgia through a campaign of violence or intimidation.\"\n\nGeorgian Dream officials dismissed the visa restrictions as interference in Georgia's internal affairs.\n\n\"The blackmail with visa restrictions are nothing but a crude attempt to limit the independence and sovereignty of Georgia,\" the Georgian Dream party said in a statement, labeling the move \"anti-Georgian.\"\n\nFor their part, European Union officials have warned that adopting the foreign agent law would jeopardize Georgia's bid for EU membership.\n\n\"The law of foreign influence is not in line with EU values. If the law is enacted, it will impact Georgia's EU path,\" said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.\n\nGeorgian officials have dismissed the critical voices in Washington and Brussels as part of

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nTBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Georgian lawmakers on Tuesday debated a motion to override a presidential veto of the \"foreign agents\" legislation that has fueled Western concerns and sparked massive protests for weeks.\n\nThe legislature controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party considered dismissing President Salome Zourabichvili's veto of the bill that she and other critics say will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.\n\nThe bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as \"pursuing the interests of a foreign power\" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.\n\nZourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. On Sunday, she accused Georgian Dream of jeopardizing the country's future and \"hindering the path towards becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.\"\n\nThe government says the bill is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilize the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million, but many Georgian journalists and activists argue that the bill's true goal is to stigmatize them and restrict debate ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October.\n\nOpponents denounce the legislation as \"the Russian law\" because it resembles measures pushed through by the Kremlin to crack down on independent news media, nonprofits and activists. Critics say the measure may have been driven by Moscow to thwart Georgia's chances of further integrating with the West.\n\nThe bill is nearly identical to one that the ruling party was pressured to withdraw last year after massive street protests. Renewed demonstrations again gripped Georgia as the bill made its way through parliament. Demonstrators scuffled with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy arm has said that adoption of the law \"negatively impacts Georgia's progress on the EU path.\"\n\nLast week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia.\" He noted that \"it remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\"\n\nThe EU offered Georgia candidate status last December, while making it clear that Tbilisi needs to implement key policy recommendations for its membership bid to progress.\n\nThe opposition United National Movement has described the bill as part of efforts by Georgian Dream to drag the country into Russia's sphere of influence -- claims it vehemently denies. Georgian Dream was founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire who made his fortune in Russia.\n\nZuka Elbakidze, a student who was among protesters rallying in Tbilisi ahead of Tuesday's vote, said \"this day will determine the fate of our country,\" adding that \"we are making a choice between Europe and Russia, and all the people gathered here, except the policemen, want Europe and the West.\"\n\n\"We are physically witnessing, literally witnessing, how Georgian citizens, how members of the Georgian Parliament are selling out our country,\" said another protester, Mariam Geguchadze.\n\nRussia-Georgia relations have often been rocky since Georgia became independent after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow then recognized South Ossetia and another separatist province, Abkhazia, as independent states and strengthened its military presence there. Most of the world considers both regions to be parts of Georgia.\n\nTbilisi cut diplomatic ties with Moscow, and the regions' status remains a key irritant even as Russia-Georgia relations have improved in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Dream", "type":

Opponents of the bill gathered outside the parliament building, some shouting \"Slaves!\", as the vote was announced.\n\nThe EU has said that the law will be an obstacle to the country's accession to the bloc, a goal supported by up to 80% of the electorate. In a statement on Tuesday evening the EU said it \"deeply regrets\" the vote to override the veto and was considering all its options.\n\n\"The EU has stressed repeatedly that the law adopted by the Georgian parliament goes against EU core principles and values,\" it said.\n\nThe EU offered Georgia candidate status last December, while noting that Tbilisi needed to implement key policy recommendations for its membership submission to progress.\n\nIn response to the vote on Tuesday, Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, said: \"A very sad day for Georgia and the rest of Europe. The passing of this law effectively puts Georgia's accession to the EU on hold, with no benefit for anybody. Almost anybody.\"\n\nThe legislation has brought hundreds of thousands of people out on to the streets of the capital, Tbilisi, in recent months. They accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of trying to smear dissenting voices as traitors and block the country's EU membership aspirations.\n\nCritics of the law also worry it will be used by the government to restrict debate in the run-up to parliamentary elections scheduled for October.\n\nOn Tuesday one protester, Giorgi Amzashvili, told Reuters that the lawmakers who had voted to override the president's veto were \"the most treacherous people in our history\". \"A disastrous day in our lives, in Georgian history. I struggle to remember anything like this,\" he said.\n\nThe EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, had earlier on Tuesday repeated warnings that the foreign agent law would hinder the country's future EU accession. \"If the law is enacted, it will impact Georgia's EU path,\" he said.\n\nThe US has also has warned that the legislation and the government's anti-western rhetoric is turning Georgia into an \"adversary\" and that Washington could pull billions in economic and military aid.\n\nLast week, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia\".\n\nMembers of the Georgian Dream party have defended the law, saying it is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilise the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people.\n\n\"What continues frustrating us is the stigmatisation of this law by internal and external actors as well as their tendency for jumping to quick conclusions,\" Shalva Papuashvili, the speaker of the Georgian parliament from the ruling Georgian Dream party, wrote in a letter to his European counterparts last week.\n\nThe debate over the newly enacted law is seen as a litmus test of whether Georgia, once one of the most pro-western former Soviet states, will now drift towards Russia.\n\nKornely Kakachia, the head of the Tbilisi-based thinktank the Georgian Institute of Politics, said the law highlighted the \"growing authoritarianism and shrinking space for debate\" under the Georgian Dream party.\n\nRussia is unpopular among ordinary Georgians, having supported armed separatists in the Moscow-backed breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the 1990s and again in 2008.\n\nOpposition parties have long accused the ruling Georgian Dream party, and its founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, of loyalties to Moscow.\n\nMany Georgians have also rallied to support Ukraine after Russia's invasion of the country and criticised their government for generally avoiding direct condemnation of Moscow and refusing to impose sanctions on Russia.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pjotr_sauer@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Pjotr Sauer",

Opponents of the bill gathered outside the parliament building, some shouting \"Slaves!\", as the vote was announced.\n\nThe EU has said that the law will be an obstacle to the country's accession to the bloc, a goal supported by up to 80 per cent of the electorate. In a statement on Tuesday evening the EU said it \"deeply regrets\" the vote to override the veto and was considering all its options.\n\n\"The EU has stressed repeatedly that the law adopted by the Georgian parliament goes against EU core principles and values,\" it said.\n\nThe EU offered Georgia candidate status last December, while noting that Tbilisi needed to implement key policy recommendations for its membership submission to progress.\n\nIn response to the vote on Tuesday, Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, said: \"A very sad day for Georgia and the rest of Europe. The passing of this law effectively puts Georgia's accession to the EU on hold, with no benefit for anybody. Almost anybody.\"\n\nThe legislation has brought hundreds of thousands of people out on to the streets of the capital, Tbilisi, in recent months. They accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of trying to smear dissenting voices as traitors and block the country's EU membership aspirations.\n\nCritics of the law also worry it will be used by the government to restrict debate in the run-up to parliamentary elections scheduled for October.\n\nOn Tuesday one protester, Giorgi Amzashvili, told Reuters that the lawmakers who had voted to override the president's veto were \"the most treacherous people in our history\". \"A disastrous day in our lives, in Georgian history. I struggle to remember anything like this,\" he said.\n\nThe EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, had earlier on Tuesday repeated warnings that the foreign agent law would hinder the country's future EU accession. \"If the law is enacted, it will impact Georgia's EU path,\" he said.\n\nThe US has also has warned that the legislation and the government's anti-western rhetoric is turning Georgia into an \"adversary\" and that Washington could pull billions in economic and military aid.\n\nLast week, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia\".\n\nMembers of the Georgian Dream party have defended the law, saying it is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilise the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people.\n\n\"What continues frustrating us is the stigmatisation of this law by internal and external actors as well as their tendency for jumping to quick conclusions,\" Shalva Papuashvili, the speaker of the Georgian parliament from the ruling Georgian Dream party, wrote in a letter to his European counterparts last week.\n\nThe debate over the newly enacted law is seen as a litmus test of whether Georgia, once one of the most pro-western former Soviet states, will now drift towards Russia.\n\nKornely Kakachia, the head of the Tbilisi-based think tank the Georgian Institute of Politics, said the law highlighted the \"growing authoritarianism and shrinking space for debate\" under the Georgian Dream party.\n\nRussia is unpopular among ordinary Georgians, having supported armed separatists in the Moscow-backed breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the 1990s and again in 2008.\n\nOpposition parties have long accused the ruling Georgian Dream party, and its founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, of loyalties to Moscow.\n\nMany Georgians have also rallied to support Ukraine after Russia's invasion of the country and criticised their government for generally avoiding direct condemnation of Moscow and refusing to impose sanctions on Russia. - Guardian", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We urge the Georgian authorities to withdraw the law, uphold their commitment to the EU path and advance the necessary reforms detailed in the 9 steps. The EU stands ready to continue supporting Georgians working towards a European future,\" he added.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. has said it was \"deeply troubled\" by Georgia's decision to pass the \"Kremlin-style 'foreign agents' legislation.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a briefing on May 14 that the law would compel the U.S. to \"fundamentally reassess\" its

That bloc has sufficient votes in parliament to override the veto.\n\nLarge protests have repeatedly gripped the capital, Tbilisi, as the measure made its way through parliament.\n\nOn Sunday, Zourabichvili and Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze decried each other in speeches at a ceremony marking Georgia's Independence Day.\n\nDemonstrators with Georgian national, U.S. and EU flags rally during an opposition protest against the foreign influence bill and celebrating of the Independence Day in the center of in Tbilisi, Georgia, Sunday, May 26, 2024.

nation and international condemnation.\n\nThe U.S., European Union, NATO and the United Nations have all expressed concern about the bill, which critics say could jeopardize Georgia's chances of joining the EU and push the country back into Russia's orbit.\n\nThe \"foreign agents\" law calls for media outlets, nonprofits and other nongovernmental organizations in the country to register as \"pursuing the interests of a foreign power\" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.\n\nRussia, which occupies about 20% of Georgia's internationally recognized territory, has used similar legislation to crack down on independent news media and activists critical of the Kremlin.\n\nGeorgian President Salome Zourabichvili vetoed the controversial legislation on May 18, saying on social media at the time that the \"fundamentally Russian\" law represents \"an obstacle to our European path.\"\n\nZourabichvili, a critic of the ruling Georgian Dream government, has called for the law to be repealed.\n\nThe Georgian Dream party has insisted the legislation is necessary, despite some of the largest demonstrations the country has seen since declaring independence from the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago.\n\nGeorgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has said the bill will create \"strong guarantees\" to help ensure long-lasting peace in the country.",

On Sunday, she accused Georgian Dream of jeopardizing the country's future and \"hindering the path towards becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.\"\n\nThe government says the bill is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilize the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million, but many Georgian journalists and activists argue that the bill's true goal is to stigmatize them and restrict debate ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October.\n\nOpponents denounce the legislation as \"the Russian law\" because it resembles measures pushed through by the Kremlin to crack down on independent news media, nonprofits and activists. Critics say the measure may have been driven by Moscow to thwart Georgia's chances of further integrating with the West.\n\nThe bill is nearly identical to one that the ruling party was pressured to withdraw last year after massive street protests. Renewed demonstrations again gripped Georgia as the bill made its way through parliament. Demonstrators scuffled with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy arm has said that adoption of the law \"negatively impacts Georgia's progress on the EU path.\"\n\nLast week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia.\" He noted that \"it remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\"\n\nThe EU offered Georgia candidate status last December, while making it clear that Tbilisi needs to implement key policy recommendations for its membership bid to progress.\n\nThe opposition United National Movement has described the bill as part of efforts by Georgian Dream to drag the country into Russia's sphere of influence -- claims it vehemently denies. Georgian Dream was founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire who made his fortune in Russia.\n\nZuka Elbakidze, a student who was among protesters rallying in Tbilisi ahead of Tuesday's vote, said \"this day will determine the fate of our country,\" adding that \"we are making a choice between Europe and Russia, and all the people gathered here, except the policemen, want Europe and the West.\"\n\n\"We are physically witnessing, literally witnessing, how Georgian citizens, how members of the Georgian Parliament are selling out our country,\" said another protester, Mariam Geguchadze.\n\nRussia-Georgia relations have often been rocky since Georgia became independent after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow then recognized South Ossetia and another separatist province, Abkhazia, as independent states and strengthened its military presence there. Most of the world considers both regions to be parts of Georgia.\n\nTbilisi cut diplomatic ties with Moscow, and the regions' status remains a key irritant even as Russia-Georgia relations have improved in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "sfgate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Francisco Gate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Dream",

I cannot speculate. I have no idea whether they're working on Russia's instructions, but they certainly are fulfilling their interests.\"\n\nTuesday's vote nearly completes a process Georgia's government began 14 months ago. Georgian Dream tried to pass the same law last year, but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water canons.\n\nIn a move widely seen as an effort to reward Georgia's citizens - of whom about 80% support joining the bloc - the EU granted it candidate status in December.\n\nBut the government reintroduced the same bill in March and this time refused to cave to public pressure, despite a month of renewed protests.\n\nCNN's Xiaofei Xu contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com",

Under Georgian law, a presidential veto may be overridden with a simple parliamentary majority, which would require 76 votes.\n\nOfficially known as the Transparency of Foreign Influence Act, the bill would require NGOs, media outlets, and individuals receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad, to register as entities \"promoting the interests of a foreign power\" and to disclose their donors. Failure to comply would be punishable by a fine of up to $9,500.\n\nCritics of the initiative, including opposition party members and President Zourabichvili, have branded the bill \"a Russian law,\" comparing it to legislation passed in Russia in 2012.\n\nThe law was initially passed by the parliament on May 14 but vetoed by Zourabichvili just four days later. According to some Georgian media reports, certain opposition MPs boycotted Tuesday's vote altogether and left the parliament, joining a crowd of protesters outside instead.\n\nThe legislation proved to be polarizing, as it sparked weeks of street protests and clashes with police in the capital, Tbilisi. The bill was first announced in March 2023, but the government was forced to back down amid large-scale protests that erupted at that time. The riots occurred again last month when the government said it would proceed with the legislation despite pressure from the opposition.\n\nThe repeal of the veto on Tuesday also sparked immediate reaction in Brussels, which warned that it \"will negatively impact Georgia's EU path.\" \"The EU and its Member States are considering all options to react to these developments,\" Brussels stated, without naming any specific steps it might take. The bloc \"deeply regrets that the Georgian Parliament decided to override the President's veto,\" it added, urging Georgian authorities to \"reverse this trend.\"\n\nLast week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that Washington would impose visa restrictions on those \"undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.\" He was referring to politicians backing the controversial bill. The warning was ridiculed as \"comical\" by the leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party's parliamentary group.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salome_Zurabishvili", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salome Zurabishvili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Georgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Georgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_demonstration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political demonstration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u20132020_Hong_Kong_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Dream", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgian Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tbilisi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tbilisi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing_and_Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing and Regulations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/665635e185f5401eb81d77ae.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9600625", "eventUri": "eng-9600625", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1195, "textEnd": 1201}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

protesters in recent weeks.\n\nThe US, Britain and the EU have all criticised the bill, which Georgian opposition groups have dubbed \"the Russian law\", saying it is modelled on Russian legislation used to target opponents of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin.\n\nRussia is unpopular among many Georgians for its support of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with public opinion broadly supportive of membership in the EU and Nato.\n\nThe US has threatened to sanction Georgian officials who vote for the bill, a big turnaround in US policy towards what had been among the most pro-Western countries to emerge from the Soviet Union.\n\nThe EU said in a statement that it \"deeply regrets\" the vote to override the veto and was \"considering all options to react to these developments.\"\n\nThe Georgian government, which says it still wants to join the EU, has accused Western countries of blackmail over their opposition to the bill.\n\nRussia denies any role in backing

parliament has voted to override a presidential veto of the \"foreign agents\" bill that has prompted huge public protests in the South Caucasus country.\n\nIt has ignored criticism from the West which says the legislation is authoritarian and Russian-inspired.\n\nThe vote on Tuesday to ignore the objections of Salome Zourabichvili, the Georgian president whose powers are mostly ceremonial, sets the stage for the speaker of parliament to sign the bill into law in the coming days.\n\nIrakli Kobakhidze, Georgia's prime minister, speaking at an Independence Day ceremony in central Tbilisi on Sunday, accused the pro-West president of treason.\n\nMr Kobakhidze took aim at Ms Zurabishvili, who was seated a few feet away, saying: \"The unity of the people and the government has allowed us over the past two years to maintain peace in the country despite existential threats and various betrayals, including the betrayal of the president.\"\n\nThe dispute about the newly-minted law has come to be seen as a key test of whether Georgia, for three decades among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states, would maintain its Western orientation, or pivot instead to Russia.\n\nThe bill would require organisations receiving more than 20 per cent of their funding from overseas to register as \"agents of foreign influence\", while also introducing punitive fines for violations, as well as onerous disclosure requirements.\n\nOpponents of the bill have for more than a month mounted some of the largest protests Georgia has seen since independence from Moscow in 1991 as the Soviet Union crumbled.\n\nThe United States, Britain and the European Union have all criticised the bill, which Georgian opposition groups have dubbed \"the Russian law\", saying it is modelled on Russian legislation used to target opponents of Vladimir Putin's Kremlin.\n\nRussia is unpopular among many Georgians for its support of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with public opinion broadly supportive of membership in the EU and Nato.\n\nThe US has threatened to sanction Georgian officials who vote for the bill, a turnaround in US policy towards what had been among the most pro-Western countries to emerge from the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Georgian government has accused Western countries of blackmail over their opposition to the bill, and says that it is necessary in order to stop them from dragging Georgia into a war with Russia.\n\nRussia denies any role in backing the bill, which it has defended from Western criticism.", "source": {"uri":

agent law would hinder the country's future EU accession. \"If the law is enacted, it will impact Georgia's EU path,\" he said, adding that the EU was preparing its response.\n\nOn Monday, seven EU member states - the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, France, the Netherlands, and Poland - called on the Georgian parliament to withdraw the foreign agent law.\n\n\"We urge you to withdraw this law and engage in a meaningful and inclusive dialogue with organised civil society and citizens,\" the joined letter read.\n\nThe US has also has warned that the legislation and the government's anti-western rhetoric is turning Georgia into an \"adversary\" and that Washington could pull billions in economic and military aid.\n\nLast week, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia\".\n\nMembers of the Georgian Dream party have defended the law, saying it is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilise the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people.\n\n\"What continues frustrating us is the stigmatisation of this law by internal and external actors as well as their tendency for jumping to quick conclusions,\" Shalva Papuashvili, the speaker of the Georgian parliament from the ruling Georgian Dream

The legislation has drawn criticism from Western nations for its authoritarian and Russian-inspired nature. Protests and international reactions have highlighted Georgia's geopolitical struggle between Western alignment and Russian influence.\n\nGeorgia's parliament voted on Tuesday to override a presidential veto of a bill on \"foreign agents\" that has plunged the South Caucasus country into crisis, ignoring criticism from the West which says the legislation is authoritarian and Russian-inspired. Tuesday's vote to ignore the objections of Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, whose powers are mostly ceremonial, sets the stage for the speaker of parliament to sign the bill into law in the coming days.\n\nThe dispute about the draft law has come to be seen as a key test of whether Georgia, for three decades among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states, would maintain its Western orientation, or pivot instead to Russia. The bill would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register as \"agents of foreign influence\", while also introducing punitive fines for violations, as well as onerous disclosure requirements.\n\nThe Georgian government says the bill is necessary to promote transparency and to stop what it describes as a plot by Western countries to drag Georgia into a war with Russia. Thousands of opponents of the bill gathered outside the fortress-like parliament building during voting on Tuesday for the latest in a series of demonstrations that are among the largest in Georgia since it won independence from Moscow in 1991 as the Soviet Union crumbled.\n\nProtester Giorgi Amzashvili said lawmakers who had voted to override the president's veto were \"the most treacherous people in our history\". \"A disastrous day in our lives, in Georgian history. I struggle to remember anything like this,\" he said\n\nLarge numbers of riot police were deployed around the parliament building, where they have used teargas, pepper spray and watercannon against protesters in recent weeks. EU 'DEEPLY REGRETS' OVERRIDING OF VETO\n\nThe United States, Britain and the European Union have all criticised the bill, which Georgian opposition groups have dubbed \"the Russian law\", saying it is modelled on Russian legislation used to target opponents of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. Russia is unpopular among many Georgians for its support of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with public opinion broadly supportive of membership in the EU and NATO.\n\nThe United States has threatened to sanction Georgian officials who vote for the bill, a major turnaround in U.S. policy towards what had been among the most pro-Western countries to emerge from the Soviet Union. The EU said in a statement that it \"deeply regrets\" the vote to override the veto and was \"considering all options to react to these developments.\"\n\nThe Georgian government, which says it still wants to join the EU, has accused Western countries of blackmail over their opposition to the bill. Russia denies any role in backing the bill, which it has defended from Western criticism.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, said in a statement introducing the legislation.\n\nResponding to Tuesday's vote, Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said it marked \"a very sad day\" for Georgia and the rest of Europe.\n\n\"The passing of this law effectively puts Georgia's accession to the EU on hold, with no benefit for anybody,\" he said.\n\nNatalie Sabanadze, Georgia's former ambassador to the EU, described the government's attempt to pass the law - just months before scheduled parliamentary elections - as a \"coup d'etat.\"\n\n\"The Georgian government is clearly siding with the Putinist, anti-liberal forces of the world\" Sabanadze told CNN. \"It's turning into an instrument in the hands of Russia. I cannot speculate. I have no idea whether they're working on Russia's instructions, but they certainly are fulfilling their interests.\"\n\nTuesday's vote nearly completes a process Georgia's government began 14 months ago. Georgian Dream tried to pass the same law last year, but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water canons.\n\nIn a move widely seen as an effort to reward Georgia's citizens - of whom about 80% support joining the bloc - the EU granted it candidate status in December.\n\nBut the government reintroduced the same bill in March and this time refused to cave to public pressure, despite a month of renewed protests.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Should she choose not to sign it, the speaker of parliament will have the authority to enact it into law.\n\nThe passage and subsequent veto override of the foreign agents bill have raised alarms among international observers and advocates for press freedom.\n\nThey warn that the legislation could severely restrict the operation of independent media and civil society organizations in Georgia, thereby weakening democratic norms and institutions in the country.\n\nThe European Union has also expressed concerns regarding the bill's potential impact on Georgia's EU membership prospects.\n\nEuropean Commission officials have previously stated that such legislation would be incompatible with the values and standards expected of EU candidate countries.", "source": {"uri": "i24news.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "i24NEWS English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Georgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Georgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salome_Zurabishvili", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salome Zurabishvili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Dream", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgian Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enlargement of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_enlargement_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potential enlargement of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.i24news.tv/uploads/a5/d7/6b/13/e6/19/17/d9/5d/79/34/57/d6/b4/a9/f7/a5d76b13e61917d95d793457d6b4a9f7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9600625", "eventUri": "eng-9600625", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 1123, "textEnd": 1129}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Critics have said the law was inspired by Vladimir Putin's crackdown on non-governmental organisations and independent media.\n\nA majority of 84 MPs in Georgia's 140-strong parliament voted in favour of the bill on Tuesday. Opposition lawmakers left the house to join demonstrators outside, who were waving EU flags and chanting \"slaves\" in reference to the ruling Georgian Dream party's alleged ties to Russia.\n\nThe decision marks a pivotal moment in the modern history of Georgia, which celebrated its 33rd anniversary of independence from the USSR this week. Despite being nominally committed to EU integration, the ruling Georgian Dream party has largely ignored the list of reforms it should be pursuing in order to start membership talks, and instead has started moving the country back into Russia's orbit.\n\nTuesday's vote marked the final step in a process that lasted several months and was accompanied by violent clashes in parliament and on the streets. Georgian president and critic of the law Salome Zourabichvili vetoed the decision earlier this month, but Georgian Dream mustered the parliamentary majority to override it.\n\nControlled by pro-Russian oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, the ruling party first introduced the draft law last year, only to withdraw it after mass protests. It then reinstated the bill in April, ignoring warnings from western capitals and tens of thousands of Georgians who have joined daily protests.\n\nThe rallies have frequently escalated into violent clashes with riot police, who have used water cannons, tear gas and truncheons against demonstrators. Many protesters have ended up in hospital and dozens have been arrested.\n\nActivists have reported Russian-style harassment, with hundreds receiving threatening calls from unknown numbers.\n\nThese callers, who claimed to \"know where the relatives [of those who received the calls] live\", advised them to \"be more cautious\" if they did not stop participating in the protests, according to their accounts shared with the FT and reports from independent Georgian media.\n\nThe law not only poses a threat to Georgia's domestic political situation but also jeopardises all the foreign policy goals that the country has pursued over the past 20 years.\n\nWeeks after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Georgia applied for EU membership and was granted candidate status last year. Brussels has repeatedly warned that if the \"foreign agents\" law passes, Georgia's EU bid, supported by more than 80 per cent of the population, will be frozen.\n\n\"The adoption of this law negatively impacts Georgia's progress on the EU path,\" the European Commission warned earlier this month. It added that the bloc had \"clearly and repeatedly stated that the spirit and content of the law are not in line with EU core norms and values\".\n\nThe US already imposed sanctions including visa restrictions on those \"responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia\" and ordered a comprehensive review of all US-Georgia co-operation, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said last week.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that several EU countries had advocated for sanctions against Georgia, including suspending visa-free travel to the bloc. Georgian NGOs warn that this measure will backlash on pro-European Georgians.\n\n\"Either they still do not understand the gravity of the consequences if the law is passed, or they want to pretend they do not understand,\" said one of several western officials who visited Tbilisi in recent weeks.\n\nIvanishvili did not meet any of the European and US officials who came to Georgia and the talks with parliament members were \"not extremely productive\", the delegation member told the FT.\n\nEuropean officials took part in the protests outside parliament, which prompted members of the ruling party to accuse them of meddling in Georgia's internal affairs.\n\nLast week Georgian Dream urged the US to \"show respect for the Georgian state\" and refrain from \"insulting blackmail\" with sanctions in response to the adoption of the law.\n\nThe party's statement echoed the sentiment of the conspiratorial, anti-western speech its founder Ivanishvili delivered at a state-organised pro-government rally in late April, depicting Georgia as a victim of a \"global party of war\" and its alleged agents among civil rights groups.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news",

The legislation requires NGOs receiving foreign funding to register as foreign agents. This proposal has been met with significant resistance from civil society organizations fearing that the law could be used to limit their influence and operation. Law enforcement officers and protesters have clashed near the parliament building, accentuating the tense environment surrounding this controversial legislation.\n\nDespite President Salome Zourabichvili's attempt to veto the bill, parliament overruled the decision, further inflaming the political tension between the president and the legislative body. Internationally, countries including the United States and the EU have raised concerns about the implications of the new law for Georgia's democracy and citizens' liberties.\n\nCritics argue that it could limit freedom of speech, restrict the work of human rights groups, and potentially harm Georgia's chances for European Union (EU) membership. The legislation commands media outlets and NGOs receiving over 20% of their funding from abroad register as entities \"conducting the business of foreign principals.\" This, critics argue, limits media freedom and could negatively impact Georgia's potential EU membership.\n\nSupporters of the law, including the Georgian Dream party, argue it ensures transparency of foreign funding and prevents potential foreign interference.\n\nHowever, opponents warn it inhibits press freedom and could result in self-censorship or loss of funding.\n\nTensions hoog between President Zourabichvili and Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, especially on Georgia's Independence Day, escalating the already charged political climate. The disagreement centers on Georgia's foreign policy and its relationship with Europe. The president believes moving closer to Europe would improve Georgia's economic prospects and secure a safer political future. In contrast, the prime minister maintains that the new law is in the country's best interest as it provides a sound legal framework that supports Georgia's development.\n\nInternationally, the situation in Georgia has attracted attention, with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken threatening travel restrictions on Georgian officials believed to undermine democratic principles. He urged national leaders to reconsider the contentious law in line with Georgia's democratic values and Euro-Atlantic ambitions.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy unit has also expressed concern over the potential negative implications of the law for Georgia's EU membership aspirations. Relations between Georgia and the EU may strain as the legislation contradicts the collective democratic values held by the European Union.

the government from passing the bill, on Monday Ms Zourabishvili presented a new charter which she said would be a plan to move Georgia towards Europe.\n\n\"To rebuild trust, we need a new political reality: a distinct unity, different elections, a different parliament, and a different government,\" she wrote on X.\n\nThe charter includes the abolition of laws which she said were harming Georgia's chances of EU membership, as well as significant reforms designed to depoliticise the justice system and security services.\n\nMs Zourabishvili invited all opposition parties to sign the charter before 1 June and go united into parliamentary elections in October.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Parliament Votes to Override Presidential Veto of 'Foreign Agent' Bill", "body": "TBILISI (Reuters) -Georgia's parliament voted on Tuesday to override a presidential veto of a bill on \"foreign agents\" that has plunged the South Caucasus country into crisis, ignoring criticism from the West which says the legislation is authoritarian and Russian-inspired.\n\nTuesday's vote to ignore the objections of Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, whose powers are mostly ceremonial, sets the stage for the speaker of parliament to sign the bill into law in the coming days.\n\nThe dispute about the newly-minted law has come to be seen as a key test of whether Georgia, for three decades among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states, would maintain its Western orientation, or pivot instead to Russia.\n\nThe bill would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register as \"agents of foreign influence\", while also introducing punitive fines for violations, as well as onerous disclosure requirements.\n\nOpponents of the bill have for more than a month mounted some of the largest protests Georgia has seen since independence from Moscow in 1991 as the Soviet Union crumbled.\n\nThe U.S., Britain and the European Union have all criticised the bill, which Georgian opposition groups have dubbed \"the Russian law\", saying it is modelled on Russian legislation used to target opponents of Vladimir Putin's Kremlin.\n\nRussia is unpopular among many Georgians for its support of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with public opinion broadly supportive of membership in the EU and NATO.\n\nThe United States has threatened to sanction Georgian officials who vote for the bill, a major turnaround in U.S. policy towards what had been among the most pro-Western countries to emerge from the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Georgian government has accused Western countries of blackmail over their opposition to the bill, and said that it is necessary in order to stop them from dragging Georgia into a war with Russia.\n\nRussia denies any role in backing the bill, which it has defended from Western criticism.\n\n(Reporting by Felix Light, Editing by Peter Graff, William Maclean)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [],

She has backed the protesters and warned that the legislation threatens Georgia's ambitions of joining the EU and NATO.\n\nThe government said the law is needed to expose the funding of non-governmental organizations and independent media. It threatens fines and imprisonment for as long as five years for organizations or individuals that receive at least 20% of their income from abroad and fail to register with the government as \"pursuing the interests of a foreign power.\"\n\nRiot police using tear gas, pepper spray and water cannon have clashed repeatedly with protesters who've gathered in huge numbers in the capital Tbilisi since the government announced plans for the law on April 3.\n\nThe US and the EU say the law is similar to one Russian President Vladimir Putin used to crush pro-democracy groups in his country. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken responded last week by announcing a comprehensive review of cooperation with Georgia and a new visa restriction policy for individuals complicit in undermining democracy in the country.\n\nThe EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December, has said that adoption of the law would jeopardize the Caucasus republic's chances of opening accession talks with the bloc in the fall.\n\nGeorgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze dismissed those warnings as \"insulting blackmail.\" He has backed claims by Georgian Dream's billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, that a \"global war party\" in the West is plotting to oust the government using NGOs and to push the country into a war with Russia.\n\nZourabichvili on Sunday marked the country's independence day by unveiling a \"Georgian Charter\" aiming to rally opposition parties ahead of planned parliamentary elections in October.\n\nShe urged parties to sign the charter committing them to repeal the law and back the creation of a technocratic government to reform Georgia's judiciary, security service and central bank before calling fresh elections.\n\nThe government's rhetoric is \"anti-Western, anti-European, from the top to the bottom of the ruling party,\" Zourabichvili said in a May 17 interview to Bloomberg TV. It's using \"very Russian language\" to attack US and EU partners who've helped Georgia for 30 years, she said.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors":

It will come into force in 60 days.\n\nAfter the law passed, Speaker of the Parliament Shalva Papuashvili hailed his party for making an 'important decision'.\n\n'No other people, no other country, no other power determines the life of our state and our people, and that's exactly what this law is about', he said.\n\nThe final adoption of the law follows almost two months of protests, during which protest leaders and government critics have faced police brutality and a spate of planned attacks near their homes by masked men. Several criminal cases were also filed against others, along with dozens of hefty fines.\n\nDuring the plenary session and before the vote, the president's parliamentary secretary, Giorgi Mskhiladze, told MPs they would not be remembered kindly by history.\n\n'Tomorrow you will have to answer to your children's question why you treated the country like this, why you treated their future like this', he said. 'You have to answer the main question, this will determine how you go down in history!' he said. He was met by angry shouts and retorts from Georgian Dream MPs.\n\nAs Georgian Dream passed the bill, tens of thousands of protesters gathered outside parliament. After it passed, several opposition MPs addressed the crowd and called on President Salome Zourabichvili to join the protest.\n\nZourabichvili then made a live broadcast, in which she called the 84 MPs who voted for the bills 'Orjonikidzes', a reference to Georgia-born Bolshevik Sergo Orjonikidze, commonly portrayed as a traitor to Georgia.\n\n'They've pushed the button [to vote] and sent their names to a specific page of history, [but] we have to do everything now to prepare for 26 October [elections], which will be our answer to today', she said. 'You are angry today, aren't you? Get upset, but let us get to business', she said, adding that the election would decide if the country had 'a European future or Russian slavery'.\n\n'Eighty-four men cannot decide this; we can. We're all together', she said.\n\nShe also vowed to continue to communicate with Georgia's western partners, adding that 'those Orjonikidze's may be sanctioned but they are not sanctioning the country'.\n\nThe ruling party has dismissed the possibility of sanctions. Following the law's adoption, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that 'any attempt to blackmail the Georgian people and the government elected by the Georgian people with sanctions or any similar measures is not serious'.\n\n'No one can punish the Georgian people and no one can punish the government elected by the Georgian people. We have strong positions on everything. We serve this society, the interests of the country'.\n\nWestern countries and institutions have voiced vehement opposition to the law.\n\nFollowing the vote, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was 'considering all options' to respond. A number of European officials have made clear Georgia will not be able to join the bloc with the legislation in place.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller opened his daily press briefing on Tuesday by reiterating that the US 'condemns' the law.\n\n'The ruling party's actions and anti-Western rhetoric threaten Georgia's democratic trajectory, future economic security, EU membership, and also put the US-Georgia relationship at risk', he said.\n\nHe also reiterated last week's announcement of visa restrictions against individuals found to be undermining democracy in Georgia as well as a reexamination of US financial assistance to the country.\n\nBipartisan legislation that could impose further sanctions has also been submitted to the US House of Representatives.\n\nGeorgia's foreign agent law would label any civil society or media organisation that received at least 20% of its funding from outside Georgia 'organisations carrying out the interests of a foreign power'. Such organisations would be subject to 'monitoring' by the Ministry of Justice every six months, which could include forcing them to hand over internal communications and documents and confidential sources. Organisations and individuals who do not comply would be subject to large fines.\n\nThe law was previously proposed last March, with tens of thousands taking to the streets against it. The protests turned violent after police deployed tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and sonic weapons in an attempt to disperse them. The government was forced to vote down the legislation -- dubbed the 'Russian law' due to its similarity to legislation used to crush civil society in Russia -- just days after it was introduced in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "oc-media.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "OC Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tata_shoshiashvili@oc-media.org", "name": "Tata Shoshiashvili", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Authorities would be granted as-yet unspecified powers to monitor their activities.\n\nOrganizations that fail to register or provide required data would be subject to fines of 25,000 lari (US$9,500) and monthly fines of 20,000 lari ($7,500) for continued non-compliance.\n\nThe law text was amended in May to allow individuals to also be liable for such fines, rendering them effective immediately rather than following an appeal.\n\nThe European Union has repeatedly warned that the law may compromise Georgia's EU aspirations.\n\nOn May 21, the Venice Commission, a legal advisory body to the Council of Europe, called on Georgian authorities to repeal the law, saying it \"has the objective effect of risking the stigmatising, silencing and eventually elimination of associations and media which receive even a low part of their funds from abroad.\"\n\nOn May 23, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a policy of visa restrictions on individuals \"responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia\" in connection with the foreign agent law, including those responsible for a \"campaign of violence or intimidation\" to suppress criticism of the bill.",

They have been met with water cannon, stun grenades and tear gas from police, and dozens have been arrested or hospitalised. Several Georgian opposition figures have reported being beaten or harassed by unknown gangs. Authorities have denied allegations of excessive force.\n\nWHAT DO RUSSIA AND THE WEST SAY?\n\nThe United States, Britain and EU countries all have warned Georgia against passing the bill, which the EU says is incompatible with its values. Georgia received EU candidate status in December, but the EU has said Tbilisi must make progress with reforms before it can join the bloc.\n\nGeorgia has traditionally proven to be one of the most staunchly pro-Western countries in the former Soviet Union, but the bill stands to threaten its strong ties with the U.S., a major aid donor. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that Washington was launching a review of cooperation with Georgia and imposing visa restrictions on individuals \"responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia\", as well as their family members. Georgian Dream slammed Washington's move, saying it amounts to \"threats and blackmail\" against Tbilisi and \"a gross attempt to restrict Georgia's independence and sovereignty\".\n\nRussia says it wants \"stability and predictability\" in Georgia but has denied it exerted pressure on its neighbour to pursue the legislation. Moscow last week joined Tbilisi in accusing the U.S. of blackmail and intimidation over the visa ban.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE FOR GEORGIA?\n\nGeorgia, a country of 3.7 million people which until 1991 was ruled from Moscow as part of the Soviet Union, stands at a crossroads in its international relations. Domestic critics say the bill will drag the country into Moscow's orbit at a time when polls show the vast majority of Georgians want to join the EU.\n\nRussia is deeply unpopular in Georgia for supporting the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, over which Moscow fought and won a brief war with Tbilisi in 2008. Georgia's government has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow over the war in Ukraine, angering Georgia's largely pro-Ukrainian public.\n\nWHY DOES IT MATTER TO THE REST OF THE WORLD?\n\nGeorgia occupies a strategic position next to Russia, Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan in a region criss-crossed by oil and gas pipelines and bordering the Black Sea. Like Ukraine, it has found itself caught between Russia and the West since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Both Georgia and Ukraine have been promised eventual NATO membership. The West has an important stake in whether Georgia returns to Moscow's orbit or throws off Russian influence - and whether that can be done without triggering further conflict.

Join us in this fight.\n\nGeorgia's parliament voted on May 28 to overrule President Salome Zourabichvili's veto of the controversial foreign agents law, moving the legislation closer to its likely enactment.\n\nThe bill requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as \"foreign agents\" and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. Zourabichvili vetoed the law on May 18, but Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili announced two days later that the ruling Georgian Dream party planned to overrule her vote.\n\nThe legislation will now be sent back to Zourabichvili, who will have five days to sign into law. In the likely situation that she refuses, Papuashvili will be able to sign it into law, after which it will be enacted.\n\nThe main provisions of the legislation will not come into force for another 60 days after it is enacted, likely occurring shortly before the parliamentary elections in October that are widely seen as a referendum on the foreign agents law and the direction that Georgian Dream is taking the country.\n\nWhile the parliament's move to overrule the veto was not unexpected, the vote came days after the the U.S. announced it was implementing travel restrictions on lawmakers who are responsible for \"undermining democracy\" in the country. The restrictions will also apply to their family members.\n\nU.S. Congressman Joe Wilson also introduced legislation on May 23 that would provide Georgia with a package of military, trade, and visa liberalization incentives for Georgia if it reverses the trend of democratic backsliding and abandons the controversial foreign agents law.\n\nSeveral EU countries are reportedly pushing for sanctions against Georgia over the bill, including suspension of the visa-free travel regime. Some European Parliament members also called to suspend Georgia's EU candidacy in response.\n\nGeorgian Dream has nonetheless remained undeterred and proceeded with the legislation, and has increased its accusations and vitriol toward the U.S. and EU.\n\nTbilisi Mayor Kakha Kaladze, who also serves as secretary general of Georgian Dream, said on May 25 that the U.S. and Georgia are \"enemies\" in response to the introduction of travel restrictions.\n\n\"I think that the existing relations (between Georgia and the U.S.) need to be restarted,\" Kaladze said.\n\nThe protesters who have been in the streets for over a month have also remained determined to continue demonstrating against the foreign agents law and Georgian Dream, with thousands showing up almost every day in front of the parliament building and around the city center.\n\nA large group of protesters gathered behind the parliament building throughout the day on May 28 as lawmakers discussed overruling the veto.\n\nProtesters have vowed to continue demonstrating.", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They have been met with water cannon, stun grenades and tear gas from police, and dozens have been arrested or hospitalised. Several Georgian opposition figures have reported being beaten or harassed by unknown gangs. Authorities have denied allegations of excessive force.\n\nWHAT DO RUSSIA AND THE WEST SAY?\n\nThe United States, Britain and EU countries all have warned Georgia against passing the bill, which the EU says is incompatible with its values. Georgia received EU candidate status in December, but the EU has said Tbilisi must make progress with reforms before it can join the bloc.\n\nGeorgia has traditionally proven to be one of the most staunchly pro-Western countries in the former Soviet Union, but the bill stands to threaten its strong ties with the U.S., a major aid donor. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that Washington was launching a review of cooperation with Georgia and imposing visa restrictions on individuals \"responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia\", as well as their family members. Georgian Dream slammed Washington's move, saying it amounts to \"threats and blackmail\" against Tbilisi and \"a gross attempt to restrict Georgia's independence and sovereignty\".\n\nRussia says it wants \"stability and predictability\" in Georgia but has denied it exerted pressure on its neighbour to pursue the legislation. Moscow last week joined Tbilisi in accusing the U.S. of blackmail and intimidation over the visa ban.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE FOR GEORGIA?\n\nGeorgia, a country of 3.7 million people which until 1991 was ruled from Moscow as part of the Soviet Union, stands at a crossroads in its international relations. Domestic critics say the bill will drag the country into Moscow's orbit at a time when polls show the vast majority of Georgians want to join the EU.\n\nRussia is deeply unpopular in Georgia for supporting the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, over which Moscow fought and won a brief war with Tbilisi in 2008. Georgia's government has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow over the war in Ukraine, angering Georgia's largely pro-Ukrainian public.\n\nWHY DOES IT MATTER TO THE REST OF THE WORLD?\n\nGeorgia occupies a strategic position next to Russia, Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan in a region criss-crossed by oil and gas pipelines and bordering the Black Sea. Like Ukraine, it has found itself caught between Russia and the West since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Both Georgia and Ukraine have been promised eventual NATO membership. The West has an important stake in whether Georgia returns to Moscow's orbit or throws off Russian influence - and whether that can be done without triggering further conflict.\n\n(Reporting by Felix

The European Union, which gave Georgia candidate status in December, has said it will be an obstacle to talks on Tbilisi joining the bloc.\n\nThe Georgian government, which maintains that it wants to join the EU, says that the bill is necessary to protect Georgian sovereignty and promote transparency. It says Western countries are using the country's NGOs to drag Georgia into confrontation with Russia.\n\nBut on the ground, many NGO workers fear that the law will stop them from providing services that the state fails to offer.\n\nKemecsei said that the draft law will force her shelter to shoulder large new administrative expenses, while also leaving them vulnerable to fines of 10,000 lari ($3,690) for mistakes made in paperwork, which she said would likely force the shelter to close down outright.\n\n\"It will add massive additional administrative costs. So on one hand, we will be having more costs. On the other hand, we will have much less income,\" she said.\n\n\"I find it immoral and unethical that we are doing the government's work for well over a decade now and we are being called foreign agents.\"\n\nVazha Kasaraishvili, program manager at Tanadgoma, an NGO that provides support to drug addicts and HIV patients, says that the law puts his group's work at risk.\n\nTanadgoma, which means \"support\" in Georgian, runs a residential rehabilitation clinic in a village outside Tbilisi that offers help and rehabilitation to those struggling with drug addiction.\n\nHe estimates that there are more than 5,000 intravenous drug users in Georgia, with limited state support provided for them.\n\nKasaraishvili fears that the \"foreign agent\" designation, which many say is reminiscent of Soviet-era denunciations of spies, will put off the foreign donors who make up the bulk of his financing.\n\n\"We don't know what will happen after this law goes through. We don't know what will happen with our international donors. Maybe they will stop supporting Georgia at all,\" said Kasaraishvili.\n\nSome NGO workers are open in their opposition to the law, taking to the street in the near-daily protests against the legislation.\n\nNino Evgenidze, head of the Economic Policy Research Center think tank, has been a regular attendee at protests against the law which she fears could shut down her organisation.\n\nEvgenidze told Reuters she saw the bill as redolent of Soviet era repressions, and opposition to it as \"a generational fight\".\n\n\"All our parents, grandpas and their parents, they were killed, exiled or jailed under these accusations that they were the agents of foreign influence,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Felix Light, Editing by William Maclean)", "source": {"uri":

The European Union, which gave Georgia candidate status in December, has said it will be an obstacle to talks on Tbilisi joining the bloc.\n\nThe Georgian government, which maintains that it wants to join the EU, says that the bill is necessary to protect Georgian sovereignty and promote transparency. It says Western countries are using the country's NGOs to drag Georgia into confrontation with Russia.\n\nBut on the ground, many NGO workers fear that the law will stop them from providing services that the state fails to offer.\n\nKemecsei said that the draft law will force her shelter to shoulder large new administrative expenses, while also leaving them vulnerable to fines of 10,000 lari ($3,690) for mistakes made in paperwork, which she said would likely force the shelter to close down outright.\n\n\"It will add massive additional administrative costs. So on one hand, we will be having more costs. On the other hand, we will have much less income,\" she said.\n\n\"I find it immoral and unethical that we are doing the government's work for well over a decade now and we are being called foreign agents.\"\n\nVazha Kasaraishvili, program manager at Tanadgoma, an NGO that provides support to drug addicts and HIV patients, says that the law puts his group's work at risk.\n\nTanadgoma, which means \"support\" in Georgian, runs a residential rehabilitation clinic in a village outside Tbilisi that offers help and rehabilitation to those struggling with drug addiction.\n\nHe estimates that there are more than 5,000 intravenous drug users in Georgia, with limited state support provided for them.\n\nKasaraishvili fears that the \"foreign agent\" designation, which many say is reminiscent of Soviet-era denunciations of spies, will put off the foreign donors who make up the bulk of his financing.\n\n\"We don't know what will happen after this law goes through. We don't know what will happen with our international donors. Maybe they will stop supporting Georgia at all,\" said Kasaraishvili.\n\nSome NGO workers are open in their opposition to the law, taking to the street in the near-daily protests against the legislation.\n\nNino Evgenidze, head of the Economic Policy Research Center think tank, has been a regular attendee at protests against the law which she fears could shut down her organisation.\n\nEvgenidze told Reuters she saw the bill as redolent of Soviet era repressions, and opposition to it as \"a generational fight\".\n\n\"All our parents, grandpas and their parents, they were killed, exiled or jailed under these accusations that they were the agents of foreign influence,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Felix Light, Editing by William Maclean)", "source": {"uri":

The legislation requires organizations receiving over 20% foreign funding to register and comply with stringent disclosure requirements. Critics argue it's inspired by Russian law, raising concerns about Georgia's Western alignment.\n\nGeorgia's parliament voted on Tuesday to override a presidential veto of a bill on \"foreign agents\" that has plunged the South Caucasus country into crisis, ignoring criticism from the West which says the legislation is authoritarian and Russian-inspired.\n\nTuesday's vote to ignore the objections of Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, whose powers are mostly ceremonial, sets the stage for the speaker of parliament to sign the bill into law in the coming days. The dispute about the newly-minted law has come to be seen as a key test of whether Georgia, for three decades among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states, would maintain its Western orientation, or pivot instead to Russia.\n\nThe bill would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register as \"agents of foreign influence\", while also introducing punitive fines for violations, as well as onerous disclosure requirements. Opponents of the bill have for more than a month mounted some of the largest protests Georgia has seen since independence from Moscow in 1991 as the Soviet Union crumbled.\n\nThe U.S., Britain and the European Union have all criticised the bill, which Georgian opposition groups have dubbed \"the Russian law\", saying it is modelled on Russian legislation used to target opponents of Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. Russia is unpopular among many Georgians for its support of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with public opinion broadly supportive of membership in the EU and NATO.\n\nThe United States has threatened to sanction Georgian officials who vote for the bill, a major turnaround in U.S. policy towards what had been among the most pro-Western countries to emerge from the Soviet Union. The Georgian government has accused Western countries of blackmail over their opposition to the bill, and said that it is necessary in order to stop them from dragging Georgia into a war with Russia.\n\nRussia denies any role in backing the bill, which it has defended from Western criticism.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

More broadly, it is seen as a ploy by the Kremlin, which is determined to bring the small Caucasus republic back into its orbit, with the consent of its ruling party.\n\nFounder and honorary president of Georgian Dream, the oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, who runs the country from the shadows, has recently thrown off the mask, turning his back on the West in order to better embrace the role model to which he owes so much. Indeed, he notably amassed his $4.9 billion (\u20ac4.5 billion) fortune - the equivalent to a third of the country's Gross Domestic Product, according to Transparency International - in Russia from 1990 to 2000. Although he has sold his Russian assets since 2012, and a few years later turned to France, which granted him citizenship in 2010 and the Legion of Honor award in 2021, the bulk of his business contacts remain in Russia, where he spent three-quarters of his adult life.\n\nHis pro-Russian turn has provoked a reaction from Zourabichvili, who has no power to counter it, as the president's duties are largely honorary. Her veto will be easily overcome on Tuesday, when a plenary session of the country's Parliament, which is dominated by Georgian Dream, votes once again in favor of the law. She still has one trump card up her sleeve: Her \"free speech,\" which she has been using to great effect at a time of uncertainty over the direction of the country's foreign policy.\n\n\"Russia's shadow looms over\" Georgia, Zourabichvili warned on Sunday, saying she was distressed to be \"forced to remind some who is the friend and who is the enemy.\" In her eyes, there was only one possible direction, that of \"rapprochement with Europe and the US.\" A rapprochement that was confirmed in December 2023, when the European Union gave Tbilisi EU candidate status, but which the \"foreign influence\" law, condemned by Brussels, Washington and the experts of the Venice Commission - a consultative body of the Council of Europe - risks compromising. \"Those who sabotage this path are trampling on the peaceful and free future of our country,\" she declared, while Kobakhidze stood beside her on the rostrum, champing at the bit.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news",

On Sunday, she accused Georgian Dream of jeopardizing the country\u00b4s future and \"hindering the path towards becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.\"\n\nThe government says the bill is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilize the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million, but many Georgian journalists and activists argue that the bill\u00b4s true goal is to stigmatize them and restrict debate ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October.\n\nOpponents denounce the legislation as \"the Russian law\" because it resembles measures pushed through by the Kremlin to crack down on independent news media, nonprofits and activists. Critics say the measure may have been driven by Moscow to thwart Georgia\u00b4s chances of further integrating with the West.\n\nA demonstrator shouts in front of police during an opposition protest against the foreign influence bill at the Parliamentary building in Tbilisi, Georgia, Tuesday, May 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Shakh Aivazov)\n\nThe bill is nearly identical to one that the ruling party was pressured to withdraw last year after massive street protests. Renewed demonstrations again gripped Georgia as the bill made its way through parliament. Demonstrators scuffled with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them.\n\nThe European Union\u00b4s foreign policy arm has said that adoption of the law \"negatively impacts Georgia\u00b4s progress on the EU path.\"\n\nLast week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia.\" He noted that \"it remains our hope that Georgia\u00b4s leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation\u00b4s democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\"\n\nThe EU offered Georgia candidate status last December, while making it clear that Tbilisi needs to implement key policy recommendations for its membership bid to progress.\n\nThe opposition United National Movement has described the bill as part of efforts by Georgian Dream to drag the country into Russia\u00b4s sphere of influence - claims it vehemently denies. Georgian Dream was founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire who made his fortune in Russia.\n\nZuka Elbakidze, a student who was among protesters rallying in Tbilisi ahead of Tuesday\u00b4s vote, said \"this day will determine the fate of our country,\" adding that \"we are making a choice between Europe and Russia, and all the people gathered here, except the policemen, want Europe and the West.\"\n\n\"We are physically witnessing, literally witnessing, how Georgian citizens, how members of the Georgian Parliament are selling out our country,\" said another protester, Mariam Geguchadze.\n\nRussia-Georgia relations have often been rocky since Georgia became independent after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow then recognized South Ossetia and another separatist province, Abkhazia, as independent states and strengthened its military presence there. Most of the world considers both regions to be parts of Georgia.\n\nTbilisi cut diplomatic ties with Moscow, and the regions\u00b4 status remains a key irritant even as Russia-Georgia relations have improved in recent years.\n\nDemonstrators wave Georgian national flags during an opposition protest against the foreign influence bill at the Parliamentary building in Tbilisi, Georgia, Tuesday, May 28, 2024.

the decision of the Georgian Parliament to override the Presidential veto of the \"anti-democratic\" foreign agents law \"that fails to conform the European norms\" and the subsequent final adoption of the law, U.S. State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller said in his first comments at the daily press briefing on May 28.\n\nMiller said that by passing the law, \"the ruling Georgian Dream party moved the country further away from the European integration path and ignored the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of the Georgian people, who have taken to the streets for weeks to oppose this law.\" He added that the Georgian Dream had disregarded the recommendation of the Venice Commission to repeal the law, as well as the concerns of all of Georgia's partners that the law would stigmatize civil society and the media and limit fundamental freedoms. \"The ruling party's actions and anti-Western rhetoric threatens Georgia's democratic trajectory, future economic security, EU membership and also, put the U.S.-Georgia relationship at risk,\" Spokesperson Miller said.\n\nNoting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent announcement of visa restrictions on those who undermine democracy in Georgia and their family members, as well as the comprehensive review of bilateral cooperation between the two countries, Spokesperson Miller said: \"We will take Georgian Dream's actions into account as we decide our own.\"\n\nMiller also said that the U.S. will continue to stand with the Georgian people \"as they work for a democratic and Western future\" and regretted that \"Georgia's leaders are choosing to forgo the steps needed to advance Georgia in the Western directions that its people want.\"", "source": {"uri": "civil.ge", "dataType": "news", "title":

The passing of this law effectively puts Georgia's accession to the EU on hold, with no benefit for anybody.

Don't forget: \"When they go low, we go high.\" Don't give up. Elections come soon.\"\n\nAnna Fotyga, MEP: \"It should be the Georgian Dream leadership that pays the price for its harmful policy of rapprochement with the bloody Kremlin regime. We shouldn't punish the people of Georgia, who, despite repressions, are courageously upholding their desire to join Euro-Atlantic institutions. I commend the Helsinki Commission for acting to protect Georgians' democracy and European choice. Europe should pass our own MEGOBARI Act to send a clear message: we will not turn a blind eye to Georgia's gradual shift into the Russian sphere of influence.\"\n\nMiriam M.

They recognize that the foreign agents bill puts that future at risk, which is why they have strongly opposed it. They have every right to pursue that future, and force must not be used to prevent peaceful assembly and the exercise of the right to freedom of expression.\n\nWe appreciate your leadership and efforts to protect civil society in Georgia.

The European Union, which gave Georgia candidate status in December, has said it will be an obstacle to talks on Tbilisi joining the bloc.\n\nThe Georgian government, which maintains that it wants to join the EU, says that the bill is necessary to protect Georgian sovereignty and promote transparency. It says Western countries are using the country\u00b4s NGOs to drag Georgia into confrontation with Russia.\n\nBut on the ground, many NGO workers fear that the law will stop them from providing services that the state fails to offer.\n\nKemecsei said that the draft law will force her shelter to shoulder large new administrative expenses, while also leaving them vulnerable to fines of 10,000 lari ($3,690) for mistakes made in paperwork, which she said would likely force the shelter to close down outright.\n\n\"It will add massive additional administrative costs. So on one hand, we will be having more costs. On the other hand, we will have much less income,\" she said.\n\n\"I find it immoral and unethical that we are doing the government's work for well over a decade now and we are being called foreign agents.\"\n\nVazha Kasaraishvili, program manager at Tanadgoma, an NGO that provides support to drug addicts and HIV patients, says that the law puts his group\u00b4s work at risk.\n\nTanadgoma, which means \"support\" in Georgian, runs a residential rehabilitation clinic in a village outside Tbilisi that offers help and rehabilitation to those struggling with drug addiction.\n\nHe estimates that there are more than 5,000 intravenous drug users in Georgia, with limited state support provided for them.\n\nKasaraishvili fears that the \"foreign agent\" designation, which many say is reminiscent of Soviet-era denunciations of spies, will put off the foreign donors who make up the bulk of his financing.\n\n\"We don't know what will happen after this law goes through.

Maybe they will stop supporting Georgia at all,\" said Kasaraishvili.\n\nSome NGO workers are open in their opposition to the law, taking to the street in the near-daily protests against the legislation.\n\nNino Evgenidze, head of the Economic Policy Research Center think tank, has been a regular attendee at protests against the law which she fears could shut down her organisation.\n\nEvgenidze told Reuters she saw the bill as redolent of Soviet era repressions, and opposition to it as \"a generational fight\".\n\n\"All our parents, grandpas and their parents, they were killed, exiled or jailed under these accusations that they were the agents of foreign influence,\" she said.

country into crisis, ignoring criticism from the West which says the legislation is authoritarian and Russian-inspired.\n\nThe May 28 vote to ignore the objections of Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, whose powers are mostly ceremonial, sets the stage for the speaker of Parliament to sign the Bill into law in the coming days.\n\nThe dispute about the newly-minted law has come to be seen as a key test of whether Georgia, for three decades among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states, would maintain its Western orientation, or pivot instead to Russia.\n\nThe Bill would require organisations receiving more than 20 per cent of their funding from overseas to register as \"agents of foreign influence\", while also introducing punitive fines for violations, as well as onerous disclosure requirements.\n\nOpponents of the Bill have for more than a month mounted some of the largest protests Georgia has seen since independence from Moscow in 1991 as the Soviet Union crumbled.\n\nThe US, Britain and the European Union have all criticised the Bill, which Georgian opposition groups have dubbed \"the Russian law\", saying it is modelled on Russian legislation used to target opponents of Vladimir Putin's Kremlin.\n\nRussia is unpopular among many Georgians for its support of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with public opinion broadly supportive of membership in the EU and Nato.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Georgian Dream slammed Washington's move, saying it amounts to \"threats and blackmail\" against Tbilisi and \"a gross attempt to restrict Georgia's independence and sovereignty\".\n\nRussia says it wants \"stability and predictability\" in Georgia but has denied it exerted pressure on its neighbour to pursue the legislation.

Domestic critics say the bill will drag the country into Moscow's orbit at a time when polls show the vast majority of Georgians want to join the EU.\n\nRussia is deeply unpopular in Georgia for supporting the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, over which Moscow fought and won a brief war with Tbilisi in 2008.

Violations could result in fines equivalent to more than $9,000.\n\nThe passage of the bill is likely to represent a pivotal moment for Georgia, which has been one of the most pro-Western states to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet Union. The bill has already unsteadied Georgia's relationship with the United States and the European Union, and it could upset the fragile geopolitics of the Caucasus, a volatile region where the interests of Russia, Turkey, Iran and the West have long come into conflict.\n\nThe bill has also set off night after night of protests in the capital, Tbilisi, that have often descended into clashes with the police. Dozens of protesters have been beaten and arrested as the police used pepper spray, tear gas and fists to disperse them.\n\nLawmakers from the ruling Georgian Dream party on Tuesday voted to override a veto of the bill that was announced on May 18 by President Salome Zourabichvili. Ms. Zourabichvili has been among the most vocal opponents of the law, but her veto was largely symbolic, because the government easily had the votes in Parliament to pass it with a simple majority.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgians", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salome_Zurabishvili", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salome Zurabishvili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Dream", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgian Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pepper spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucasus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tear gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tbilisi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tbilisi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/28/multimedia/28georgia-hfo-jcwq/28georgia-hfo-jcwq-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9600625", "eventUri": "eng-9600625", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 1407, "textEnd": 1413}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

He also urged Georgian leaders to \"take the necessary steps to advance Georgia in the right direction.\"\n\nThe preceding evening in Tbilisi saw a significant Freedom March in celebration of Georgia's Independence Day. Participants in the march protested against the proposed law on \"foreign agents\".\n\nThe Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, in an urgent opinion published on 21st May, \"strongly recommended\" that Georgia abandon the law in its current form.\n\nHowever, Georgia's ruling party dismissed the scathing assessment from the Venice Commission and pledged to proceed with the law's enactment in the coming weeks.\n\nLast week, the United States announced visa restrictions targeting individuals in Georgia deemed responsible for undermining democracy in the country.\n\nThe ruling party expressed outrage at these measures, labelling them as \"blackmail that does not align with the spirit of strategic partnership.\"\n\nGeorgia's quest for EU membership has been a longstanding national ambition, reflecting its desire to anchor itself within the Euro-Atlantic community.\n\nAchieving candidate status for EU membership marked a significant milestone in this journey, but the path ahead is fraught with challenges.\n\nThe proposed law on \"foreign agents\" has been a flashpoint in Georgian politics. Critics argue that the law is reminiscent of similar legislation in Russia, which has been used to stifle dissent and target non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and media outlets.\n\nThe ruling party, however, maintains that the law is necessary for transparency and national security.\n\nThe Venice Commission's urgent recommendation to discard the law highlights the international concern over Georgia's democratic trajectory.\n\nThe Commission's findings echo the fears of many in Georgia who worry that the law could curtail civil liberties and undermine democratic institutions.\n\nThe US visa restrictions represent a significant escalation in international pressure on Georgia.\n\nThese measures are intended to penalise those deemed responsible for anti-democratic actions and signal

A new controversial bill, labeling such shelters as 'agents of foreign influence,' threatens their operation with heavy administrative costs and fines. This legislation has sparked major protests and drawn criticism from Western countries.\n\nFor more than a decade, Sara Kemecsei's animal shelter has cared for the stray dogs of the Georgian capital.\n\nBy soliciting small donations of $5 or $10 apiece, mostly from abroad, she offers shelter and finds new homes for some of an estimated 500,000 neglected animals that wander the streets of the South Caucasus country of 3.7 million. But under a contentious bill passed by the country's parliament on Tuesday, her small shelter on Tbilisi's outskirts, which cares for up to 50 canines at a time, could be designated an \"agent of foreign influence\".\n\n\"The only interest that we pursue is the interest of these dogs, and I challenge anyone to tell me which one of them is actually a foreign power,\" said Kemecsei. The bill on \"foreign agents\" has sparked a major political crisis in Georgia since the ruling party said in April that it would reintroduce the draft law, which it previously shelved last year after protests.\n\nOn Tuesday, Georgia's parliament voted to override a presidential veto of the bill, setting the stage for it to be signed into law by parliament's speaker in the coming days. Thousands have taken to the streets in some of the biggest protests Georgia has seen since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nOpposition groups have dubbed the bill \"the Russian law\", comparing it to similar legislation that Russia has used against critics of Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. Western countries have criticised the bill, with the United States threatening to sanction Georgian officials unless it is withdrawn. The European Union, which gave Georgia candidate status in December, has said it will be an obstacle to talks on Tbilisi joining the bloc.\n\nThe Georgian government, which maintains that it wants to join the EU, says that the bill is necessary to protect Georgian sovereignty and promote transparency. It says Western countries are using the country's NGOs to drag Georgia into confrontation with Russia. But on the ground, many NGO workers fear that the law will stop them from providing services that the state fails to offer.\n\nKemecsei said that the draft law will force her shelter to shoulder large new administrative expenses, while also leaving them vulnerable to fines of 10,000 lari ($3,690) for mistakes made in paperwork, which she said would likely force the shelter to close down outright. \"It will add massive additional administrative costs. So on one hand, we will be having more costs. On the other hand, we will have much less income,\" she said.\n\n\"I find it immoral and unethical that we are doing the government's work for well over a decade now and we are being called foreign agents.\" Vazha Kasaraishvili, program manager at Tanadgoma, an NGO that provides support to drug addicts and HIV patients, says that the law puts his group's work at risk.\n\nTanadgoma, which means \"support\" in Georgian, runs a residential rehabilitation clinic in a village outside Tbilisi that offers help and rehabilitation to those struggling with drug addiction. He estimates that there are more than 5,000 intravenous drug users in Georgia, with limited state support provided for them.\n\nKasaraishvili fears that the \"foreign agent\" designation, which many say is reminiscent of Soviet-era denunciations of spies, will put off the foreign donors who make up the bulk of his financing. \"We don't know what will happen after this law goes through. We don't know what will happen with our international donors. Maybe they will stop supporting Georgia at all,\" said Kasaraishvili.\n\nSome NGO workers are open in their opposition to the law, taking to the street in the near-daily protests against the legislation. Nino Evgenidze, head of the Economic Policy Research Center think tank, has been a regular attendee at protests against the law which she fears could shut down her organisation.\n\nEvgenidze told Reuters she saw the bill as redolent of Soviet era repressions, and opposition to it as \"a generational fight\". \"All our parents, grandpas and their parents, they were killed, exiled or jailed under these accusations that they were the agents of foreign influence,\" she said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

And the political stakes just rose dramatically.\n\nGeorgia's parliament on Tuesday overrode a presidential veto of a measure that critics have dubbed the \"Russian law\" -- dealing a crippling setback to hopes by pro-democracy forces that the former Soviet republic will be able to one day join the European Union.\n\nOpponents consider the bill a heavy-handed attempt to stifle media freedom and muzzle civil society, and have staged months of massive street protests to try to block the measure. Now, barring some last-minute reversal, the parliamentary speaker is set to sign it into law within five days if the president refuses to do so.\n\n\"It's utterly pernicious,\" Hans Gutbrod, a professor of public policy at Ilia State University in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, said of the bill. \"This is a watershed moment.\"\n\nRead more: News analysis: Why Putin is raising the specter of nuclear weapons again\n\nThe EU, which had warned that enacting the measure would \"negatively affect\" Georgia's chances of being accepted into the 27-member bloc, said it \"deeply regrets\" the veto override.\n\n\"The Georgian people overwhelmingly want to join the EU,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X, adding that the bloc was \"considering all options\" in response to the veto override. She urged the Georgian government to \"recommit to the EU aspirations.\"\n\nRead more: A rift grows in Europe over recognizing Palestinian state\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller suggested that Georgia's government could find itself cut off from U.S. aid if it tilts away from democratic values.\n\n\"We have to reassess all of that if the Georgian government is going to now regard the United States and other Western partners not as partners anymore, but as adversaries,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe Biden administration had previously described the measure as undermining democracy, and warned of possible sanctions against its backers.\n\nAt first glance, the bill in question could seem like a matter of mere bureaucracy. It requires media organizations, nongovernmental groups -- many of which rely on foreign funding -- and nonprofit entities to register as \"pursuing the interests of a foreign power\" if they receive more than 20% of their funds from outside the country.\n\nRead more: Russian disinformation is about immigration. The real aim is to undercut Ukraine aid\n\nIn practice, critics say, the requirement would have a profoundly chilling impact on free expression and civil society in Georgia, a country of about 3.7 million people. Nongovernmental organizations could be subject to heavy financial penalties or be closed down altogether.\n\n\"It's a way of stigmatizing these groups -- a very familiar pattern from the Soviet past,\" said political analyst Kornely Kakachia, who directs a think tank in Tbilisi.\n\nThe measure is modeled after a nearly identical one in Russia that has been wielded by the Kremlin to crack down on political opposition. After a failed bid to push through a similar measure a year ago, critics say Moscow actively worked behind the scenes to engineer the bill's passage this time around. The Kremlin denies involvement.\n\nGeorgia's parliament is controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, which had campaigned on a pro-EU platform, but then began taking steps to weaken a membership bid, culminating in this bill.\n\nTuesday's vote by lawmakers -- a raucous affair during which a member of the ruling party drenched the leader of the opposition with water as he was speaking -- overrode a May 18 veto by President Salome Zourabichvili, a political independent whose post is largely symbolic. The president had denounced the bill as hindering Georgia's efforts toward becoming a \"full member of the free and democratic world.\"\n\nRead more: How Putin's crackdown on dissent became the hallmark of the Russian leader's 24 years in power\n\nGeorgia's ruling party insists the measure is meant to prevent foreign forces from destabilizing the country. But critics call it the most determinedly authoritarian effort yet to snuff out pro-Western sentiment that has come to prevail in the three decades of independence.\n\nThe conflict intensified at the end of 2023, when the EU granted Georgia candidate status as a step toward membership in the bloc. For much of this year, demonstrations denouncing the foreign-agent measure grew larger and larger -- and were met by increasing shows of government force.\n\nFootage from Tbilisi repeatedly showed police using tear gas and water cannons to try to break up enormous crowds in the city's historic center. On Tuesday evening, after the vote, riot police were again out in force.\n\nRead more: Blinken, in a somber visit to Kyiv, reasserts U.S. support for Ukraine\n\nThe ruling party was founded by a pro-Moscow oligarch and former prime minister named Bidzina Ivanishvili, whose wealth is directly tied to Russia. He and his party deny they are trying to push Georgia into Moscow's orbit -- but the crisis has played itself out against the backdrop of President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, another neighbor whose sovereignty Russia has violently rejected.\n\nLike Ukraine, Georgia gained its independence after the Soviet Union imploded in 1991. But shaking off Russia's grip has not been easy. In 2008, Russia and Georgia went to war over the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia.\n\nIn order to stay on a track toward EU membership, Georgia would have to make progress on certain key benchmarks, including upholding fundamental rights and protecting civil society.\n\nKakachia, who directs the Georgian Institute of Politics, said even though the struggle has weighty implications for both the West and Russia, pro-democracy forces in his country had a difficult time getting the attention of the outside world.\n\n\"Georgia is not a priority right now,\" he said, citing the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, continent-wide elections in Europe next month and the American presidential election in November. \"And this benefits the government.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

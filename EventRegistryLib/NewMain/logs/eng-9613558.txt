And the combined assets of the groups would total around \u00a3366.3bn.\n\nVirgin Money is the UK's sixth largest retail bank with about 6.6 million customers. Nationwide has almost 18 million customers.\n\nLast week, Virgin Money shareholders voted to accept Nationwide's offer, despite fears from some investors that the deal might \"sell shareholders very short\".\n\nThe CMA has set a 40-day deadline for the first stage of its probe. It will assess whether the deal constitutes a \"relevant merger situation\" and if it could lead to a substantial lessening of competition.\n\nThe CMA is inviting comments from interested parties, with its consultation period ending on 14 June.", "source": {"uri": "thebusinessdesk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miran_rahman@thebusinessdesk.com", "name": "Miran Rahman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Money_UK", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virgin Money UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Building society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyds_Banking_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lloyds Banking Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Contests", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Camp_and_Competition_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Camp and Competition Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/_files/images/oct_22/Virgin-Money-Store-Exterior-scaled-e1664978663970.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613558", "eventUri": "eng-9613558", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1235, "textEnd": 1242}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 454875645, "relevance": 2}

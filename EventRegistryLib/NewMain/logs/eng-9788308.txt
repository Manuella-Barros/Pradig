Organizers had said that water quality tests done the day of the individual triathlon races showed \"very good\" bacteria levels.\n\nOn Sunday night, representatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities reviewed water tests.

The decisions have generally been made at early morning meetings on the day of the event. But in announcing Sunday night that the race would happen Monday, organizers said they were responding to requests from athletes to give them more time to prepare.\n\nLeading up to the individual triathlon events, water quality concerns prompted organizers to cancel the swimming portion of two test runs meant to allow athletes to familiarize themselves with the course and also to delay the men's race by a day. Test swims in the Seine scheduled for Saturday and Sunday before the triathlon mixed relay were also canceled because of bacteria levels in the water.\n\nThe Belgian committee said it \"hopes that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games.

Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon at the Paris Olympics after one of its competitors who swam in the Seine River fell ill.\n\nParis, Aug 5 (AP) Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon at the Paris Olympics after one of its competitors who swam in the Seine River fell ill.\n\nClaire Michel, who competed in the women's triathlon Wednesday, \"is unfortunately ill and will have to withdraw from the competition,\" the Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee said in a statement.\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: Noah Lyles Takes Away Gold Medal by Whisker in Men's 100-Meter Final.\n\nParis 2024 organizers had no immediate statement on Michel's illness, but said in a statement Sunday night that the mixed relay triathlon would proceed Monday at 8 a.m. The swim portion of the competition is slated for the Seine.\n\nThe Belgian committee's statement did not elaborate on Michel's illness but it comes after concerns over the river's water quality. Organizers had said that water quality tests done the day of the individual triathlon races showed \"very good\" bacteria levels.\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: India To Take On Germany in Semifinals of Men's Hockey.\n\nOn Sunday night, representatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities reviewed water tests. The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over recent hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli, in the Seine's waters. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast when determining whether to go forward with a race. The decisions have generally been made at early morning meetings on the day of the event. But in announcing Sunday night that the race would happen Monday, organizers said they were responding to requests from athletes to give them more time to prepare.\n\nLeading up to the individual triathlon events, water quality concerns prompted organizers to cancel the swimming portion of two test runs meant to allow athletes to familiarize themselves with the course and also to delay the men's race by a day. Test swims in the Seine scheduled for Saturday and Sunday before the triathlon mixed relay were also canceled because of bacteria levels in the water.\n\nThe Belgian committee said it \"hopes that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games. We are thinking here of the guarantee of training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes, entourage and supporters.\"\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who also competed in the Seine on Wednesday, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to the swim and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes had reported stomach problems.\n\nSwiss officials said in an update Sunday that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine, the statement said. The Swiss team still planned to compete in the mixed relay Monday.\n\nNorwegian triathlete Vetle Bergsvik Thorn got sick a day after competing in the men's triathlon. Thorn told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that he woke up the next day with an upset stomach and was vomiting but thought that the likely cause was food poisoning. He said he felt better later that day and was planning on competing again in the mixed relay scheduled for Monday.\n\nArild Tveiten, the sports director of the Norwegian Triathlon Federation, said the cause of Thorn's illness was unclear.\n\n\"We're thinking what everyone is thinking: that it's probably the river. But we don't know. It could be the river, it could be the chicken,\" Tveiten told NRK. \"The doctor is leaning toward the possibility of food poisoning. That's what the symptoms suggest.\"\n\nMarathon swimming events are set to be held in the Seine on Thursday and Friday.\n\nFive of the eight swimmers in the men's 1,500-meter freestyle Sunday night were listed to be entered in the 10-kilometer marathon swim.\n\nBronze medalist Daniel Wiffen of Ireland, who won an earlier gold in the 800 free, said he wouldn't train ahead of time in the Seine: \"I don't want to try to deal with any illness.\"\n\nHe said he would instead train in pools around Paris, even if it means \"going in blind.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType":

The statement did not specify Michel's illness, which was reported days after she swam in the River Seine during the women's triathlon on Wednesday.\n\n\"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon must unfortunately announce that the 'Belgian Hammers' will not be starting the mixed relay at the Paris Olympic Games tomorrow. The decision, like this communication, was taken in consultation with the athletes and their entourage,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Claire Michel, a member of the relay, is unfortunately ill and must withdraw from the competition.\"\n\nMichel finished 38th in the women's triathlon competition on Wednesday.\n\nThe statement also had pointed words that appeared to be aimed at organizers: \"The COIB and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games such as guaranteeing training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes and support personnel.\"\n\nThe Swiss team, meanwhile, had to replace Adrien Briffod, who had to withdraw due to a gastrointestinal infection. Simon Westermann will replace him.\n\nSwiss Olympic Chief Medical Officer Hanspeter Betschart noted that it is unclear if Briffod's infection is related to the Seine's water quality.\n\n\"A survey of my colleagues from other countries has so far not revealed any accumulation of gastrointestinal illnesses among the athletes who started the individual race last Wednesday,\" Betschart said.\n\nMixed relay triathlon to proceed on Monday\n\nDespite the two illnesses, World Triathlon and Paris 2024 have said in a Sunday statement that Monday's mixed relay triathlon will proceed as planned, saying that the water quality in the Seine has improved over the past few hours.\n\n\"The latest analysis results confirm that the water quality of the Seine at the triathlon site has improved over the past few hours, and prospective analyses indicate that the water quality will be within acceptable limits by World Triathlon. As a result, World Triathlon has made the decision this evening to continue the competition,\" the statement read in part.\n\nThe individual triathlon competitions went ahead on Wednesday after concerns over water quality in the River Seine caused the men's race to be postponed a day earlier. More rain came into Paris overnight on Tuesday ahead of the race, but World Triathlon and Paris 2024 determined the water quality was sufficient to move ahead for both the women's and men's races.\n\n\"Following a meeting on water quality held on 31 July at 3:30 a.m. attended by Paris 2024, representatives of World Triathlon and their Technical and Medical Delegates, M\u00e9t\u00e9o France, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the \u00cele-de-France Region involved in carrying out water quality tests, the stakeholders involved have confirmed that the women's and the men's triathlons will go ahead as planned on 31 July at 8 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. respectively,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a joint statement.\n\nThe athletes had largely put their trust in organizers to ensure that the water quality was safe for them. Women's silver medal winner Julie Derron of Switzerland said the athletes believed that the race was safe based on the word of authorities.\n\n\"The swimming was fine during the race. We know that they took samples this morning. They take a lot of time to analyze, so we don't know the results obviously. We all trust the authorities and the organizers that they keep us safe. And so we had a safe race today,\" she said.\n\nAfter the race, men's gold medal winner Alex Yee was complimentary to the organizers.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have probably the most beautiful venue of any race in the Olympics. And I guess that came with a small penalty of the risk of the Seine being dirty,\" he said.\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris last weekend, drenching the opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was canceled for two straight days last week after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that the races would go ahead as planned.\n\nSeine clean-up\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) had been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races took place with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nThe mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente, Kevin Dotson and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The statement did not elaborate on Michel's illness but it comes after concerns over the river's water quality. Organizers had said that water quality tests done the day of the individual triathlon races showed \"very good\" bacteria levels.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli, in the Seine's waters. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast when determining whether to go forward with a race. The decisions are made at early morning meetings on the day of the event.\n\nLeading up to the individual triathlon events, water quality concerns prompted organizers to cancel the swimming portion of two test runs meant to allow athletes to familiarize themselves with the course and also to delay the men's race by a day. Test swims in the Seine scheduled for Saturday and Sunday before the triathlon mixed relay were also canceled because of bacteria levels in the water.\n\nOrganizers have said that if the water quality is not acceptable for Monday's triathlon mixed relay, they can postpone it until Tuesday. If concerns persist, the plan is to skip the swimming leg and only have athletes compete in the biking and running portions.\n\nThe Belgian committee said it \"hopes that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games. We are thinking here of the guarantee of training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes, entourage and supporters.\"\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who also competed in the Seine on Wednesday, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to the swim and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes had reported stomach problems.\n\nSwiss officials said in an update Sunday that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine, the statement said. The Swiss team still planned to compete in the mixed relay Monday.\n\nNorwegian triathlete Vetle Bergsvik Thorn got sick a day after competing in the men's triathlon. Thorn told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that he woke up the next day with an upset stomach and was vomiting but thought that the likely cause was food poisoning. He said he felt better later that day and was planning on competing again in the mixed relay scheduled for Monday.\n\nArild Tveiten, the sports director of the Norwegian Triathlon Federation, said the cause of Thorn's illness was unclear.\n\n\"We're thinking what everyone is thinking: that it's probably the river.

The statement did not specify Michel's illness, which was reported days after she swam in the River Seine during the women's triathlon on Wednesday.\n\n\"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon must unfortunately announce that the 'Belgian Hammers' will not be starting the mixed relay at the Paris Olympic Games tomorrow. The decision, like this communication, was taken in consultation with the athletes and their entourage,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Claire Michel, a member of the relay, is unfortunately ill and must withdraw from the competition.\"\n\nMichel finished 38th in the women's triathlon competition on Wednesday.\n\nThe statement also had pointed words that appeared to be aimed at organizers: \"The COIB and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games such as guaranteeing training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes and support personnel.\"\n\nThe Swiss team, meanwhile, had to replace Adrien Briffod, who had to withdraw due to a gastrointestinal infection. Simon Westermann will replace him.\n\nSwiss Olympic Chief Medical Officer Hanspeter Betschart noted that it is unclear if Briffod's infection is related to the Seine's water quality.\n\n\"A survey of my colleagues from other countries has so far not revealed any accumulation of gastrointestinal illnesses among the athletes who started the individual race last Wednesday,\" Betschart said.\n\nMixed relay triathlon to proceed on Monday\n\nDespite the two illnesses, World Triathlon and Paris 2024 have said in a Sunday statement that Monday's mixed relay triathlon will proceed as planned, saying that the water quality in the Seine has improved over the past few hours.\n\n\"The latest analysis results confirm that the water quality of the Seine at the triathlon site has improved over the past few hours, and prospective analyses indicate that the water quality will be within acceptable limits by World Triathlon. As a result, World Triathlon has made the decision this evening to continue the competition,\" the statement read in part.\n\nThe individual triathlon competitions went ahead on Wednesday after concerns over water quality in the River Seine caused the men's race to be postponed a day earlier. More rain came into Paris overnight on Tuesday ahead of the race, but World Triathlon and Paris 2024 determined the water quality was sufficient to move ahead for both the women's and men's races.\n\n\"Following a meeting on water quality held on 31 July at 3:30 a.m. attended by Paris 2024, representatives of World Triathlon and their Technical and Medical Delegates, M\u00e9t\u00e9o France, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the \u00cele-de-France Region involved in carrying out water quality tests, the stakeholders involved have confirmed that the women's and the men's triathlons will go ahead as planned on 31 July at 8 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. respectively,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a joint statement.\n\nThe athletes had largely put their trust in organizers to ensure that the water quality was safe for them. Women's silver medal winner Julie Derron of Switzerland said the athletes believed that the race was safe based on the word of authorities.\n\n\"The swimming was fine during the race. We know that they took samples this morning. They take a lot of time to analyze, so we don't know the results obviously. We all trust the authorities and the organizers that they keep us safe. And so we had a safe race today,\" she said.\n\nAfter the race, men's gold medal winner Alex Yee was complimentary to the organizers.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have probably the most beautiful venue of any race in the Olympics. And I guess that came with a small penalty of the risk of the Seine being dirty,\" he said.\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris last weekend, drenching the opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was cancelled for two straight days last week after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that the races would go ahead as planned.\n\nSeine clean-up\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout US$1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) had been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80 per cent capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic metres (40 million litres) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races took place with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nThe mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-metre swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente, Kevin Dotson and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV

It comes after concerns over water quality in the Seine, where the swimming portion of triathlons is taking place.\n\nBelgium has pulled out of the Olympic mixed relay triathlon after an athlete who swam in the River Seine fell ill.\n\nClaire Michel \"is unfortunately ill and will have to withdraw from the competition,\" the Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee said on Sunday.\n\nMichel, 35, was taken to a clinic in the Olympic Village and stayed in the athletes' accommodation area on Sunday night.\n\nBelgian officials did not elaborate on Michel's illness but the team's withdrawal comes after questions about the water quality of the Seine. Michel competed in the women's triathlon on Wednesday, finishing 38th.\n\nIn the run-up to the individual triathlon events last week, concerns prompted organisers to delay the men's race by a day and cancel the swimming portion of two test runs.\n\nTest swims scheduled for Saturday and Sunday were also cancelled because of bacteria levels in the water.\n\nBut organisers confirmed on Sunday night that the mixed relay triathlon would proceed at 8am on Monday after water tests were reviewed.\n\nThey added that water quality tests done the day of the individual triathlon races showed \"very good\" bacteria levels.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of faecal bacteria, including E. coli, in the Seine's waters.\n\nWorld Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels of up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 millilitres can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nThe organisation's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast when determining whether to go forward with a race.\n\nBelgium's Olympic team released a statement saying reports Michel was in hospital for four days were incorrect.\n\nThe team also said that it \"hopes that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games\".\n\nIt added: \"We are thinking here of the guarantee of training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes, entourage and supporters.\"\n\nOrganisers of the Paris 2024 Games said they wished Ms Michel \"a quick recovery and will seek regular updates on their health\".\n\nThey added: \"Paris 2024 wishes to remind everyone that the health and wellbeing of athletes is our top priority.\n\n\"With respect to competitions held in the Seine, water quality tests are carried out daily and the decision on whether to proceed with an event is taken by the International Federation, World Triathlon, in coordination with Paris 2024, and based on the results and a range of criteria.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Swiss officials said on Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who also competed in the Seine on Wednesday, fell ill with a stomach infection.\n\nBut they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to the swim and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes had reported stomach problems.\n\nSimon Westermann, who had been lined up to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection, Swiss officials said in an update on Sunday.\n\nWestermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine, the statement said.\n\nNorwegian triathlete Vetle Bergsvik Thorn also got sick a day after competing in the men's triathlon.\n\nThorn told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that he woke up the next day with an upset stomach and was vomiting but thought that the likely cause was food poisoning.\n\nHe said he felt better later that day and was planning on competing again in the mixed relay event.\n\nMarathon swimming events are scheduled to take place in the Seine on Thursday and Friday.\n\nFive of the eight swimmers who competed in the men's 1,500 metre freestyle on Sunday night were listed to be entered in the 10-kilometre marathon swim.\n\nBronze medallist Daniel Wiffen from Ireland, who won an earlier gold in the 800-metre freestyle, said he wouldn't train ahead of time in the Seine, saying: \"I don't want to try to deal with any illness.\"\n\nHe said he would instead train in pools around Paris, even if it means \"going in blind\".", "source": {"uri":

With respect to competitions held in the Seine, water quality tests are carried out daily, and the decision on whether to proceed with an event is taken by the International Federation World Triathlon, in coordination with Paris 2024, and based on the results and a range of (notably health) criteria,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Water samples taken in the Seine on the morning of the individual triathlon events showed the quality to be at a level considered 'very good' by World Triathlon's criteria, according to results analysed and released the following day,\" the statement added in part.\n\nDespite the two illnesses, World Triathlon and Paris 2024 have said in a Sunday statement that Monday's mixed relay triathlon will proceed as planned, saying that the water quality in the Seine has improved over the past few hours.\n\n\"The latest analysis results confirm that the water quality of the Seine at the triathlon site has improved over the past few hours, and prospective analyses indicate that the water quality will be within acceptable limits by World Triathlon. As a result, World Triathlon has made the decision this evening to continue the competition,\" the statement read in part.\n\nThe individual triathlon competitions went ahead on Wednesday after concerns over water quality in the River Seine caused the men's race to be postponed a day earlier. More rain came into Paris overnight on Tuesday ahead of the race, but World Triathlon and Paris 2024 determined the water quality was sufficient to move ahead for both the women's and men's races.\n\n\"Following a meeting on water quality held on 31 July at 3:30 a.m. attended by Paris 2024, representatives of World Triathlon and their Technical and Medical Delegates, M\u00e9t\u00e9o France, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the \u00cele-de-France Region involved in carrying out water quality tests, the stakeholders involved have confirmed that the women's and the men's triathlons will go ahead as planned on 31 July at 8 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. respectively,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a joint statement.\n\nThe athletes had largely put their trust in organizers to ensure that the water quality was safe for them. Women's silver medal winner Julie Derron of Switzerland said the athletes believed that the race was safe based on the word of authorities.\n\n\"The swimming was fine during the race. We know that they took samples this morning. They take a lot of time to analyze, so we don't know the results obviously. We all trust the authorities and the organizers that they keep us safe. And so we had a safe race today,\" she said.\n\nAfter the race, men's gold medal winner Alex Yee was complimentary to the organizers.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have probably the most beautiful venue of any race in the Olympics. And I guess that came with a small penalty of the risk of the Seine being dirty,\" he said.\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris last weekend, drenching the opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was canceled for two straight days last week after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that the races would go ahead as planned.\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) had been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races took place with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nThe mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente, Kevin Dotson and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

And so we had a safe race today,\" she said.\n\nAfter the race, men's gold medal winner Alex Yee was complimentary to the organizers.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have probably the most beautiful venue of any race in the Olympics. And I guess that came with a small penalty of the risk of the Seine being dirty,\" he said.\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris last weekend, drenching the opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was canceled for two straight days last week after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that the races would go ahead as planned.\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) had been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races took place with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nThe mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente, Kevin Dotson and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The statement did not specify Michel's illness, which was reported days after she swam in the River Seine during the women's triathlon on Wednesday.\n\n\"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon must unfortunately announce that the 'Belgian Hammers' will not be starting the mixed relay at the Paris Olympic Games tomorrow. The decision, like this communication, was taken in consultation with the athletes and their entourage,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Claire Michel, a member of the relay, is unfortunately ill and must withdraw from the competition.\"\n\nMichel finished 38th in the women's triathlon competition on Wednesday.\n\nThe statement also had pointed words that appeared to be aimed at organizers: \"The COIB and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games such as guaranteeing training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes and support personnel.\"\n\nThe Swiss team, meanwhile, had to replace Adrien Briffod, who had to withdraw due to a gastrointestinal infection. Simon Westermann will replace him.\n\nSwiss Olympic Chief Medical Officer Hanspeter Betschart noted that it is unclear if Briffod's infection is related to the Seine's water quality.\n\n\"A survey of my colleagues from other countries has so far not revealed any accumulation of gastrointestinal illnesses among the athletes who started the individual race last Wednesday,\" Betschart said.\n\nTriathlons proceeded amid water quality concerns\n\nThe individual triathlon competitions went ahead in Paris after concerns over water quality in the River Seine caused the men's race to be postponed a day earlier. More rain came into Paris overnight ahead of the race, but World Triathlon and Paris 2024 determined the water quality was sufficient to move ahead for both the women's and men's races.\n\n\"Following a meeting on water quality held on 31 July at 3:30 a.m. attended by Paris 2024, representatives of World Triathlon and their Technical and Medical Delegates, M\u00e9t\u00e9o France, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the \u00cele-de-France Region involved in carrying out water quality tests, the stakeholders involved have confirmed that the women's and the men's triathlons will go ahead as planned on 31 July at 8 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. respectively,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a joint statement.\n\nThe athletes had largely put their trust in organizers to ensure that the water quality was safe for them. Women's silver medal winner Julie Derron of Switzerland said the athletes believed that the race was safe based on the word of authorities.\n\n\"The swimming was fine during the race. We know that they took samples this morning. They take a lot of time to analyze, so we don't know the results obviously. We all trust the authorities and the organizers that they keep us safe. And so we had a safe race today,\" she said.\n\nAfter the race, men's gold medal winner Alex Yee was complimentary to the organizers.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have probably the most beautiful venue of any race in the Olympics. And I guess that came with a small penalty of the risk of the Seine being dirty,\" he said.\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris last weekend, drenching the opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was canceled for two straight days last week after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that the races would go ahead as planned.\n\nSeine clean-up\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) had been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races took place with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nThe mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente, Kevin Dotson and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The decision, like this communication, was taken in consultation with the athletes and their entourage,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Claire Michel, a member of the relay, is unfortunately ill and must withdraw from the competition.\"\n\nMichel finished 38th in the women's triathlon competition on Wednesday.\n\nThe statement also had pointed words that appeared to be aimed at organizers: \"The COIB and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games such as guaranteeing training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes and support personnel.\"\n\nThe triathlon competitions went ahead in Paris after concerns over water quality in the River Seine caused the men's race to be postponed a day earlier. More rain came into Paris overnight ahead of the race, but World Triathlon and Paris 2024 determined the water quality was sufficient to move ahead for both the women's and men's races.\n\n\"Following a meeting on water quality held on 31 July at 3:30 a.m. attended by Paris 2024, representatives of World Triathlon and their Technical and Medical Delegates, M\u00e9t\u00e9o France, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the \u00cele-de-France Region involved in carrying out water quality tests, the stakeholders involved have confirmed that the women's and the men's triathlons will go ahead as planned on 31 July at 8 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. respectively,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a joint statement.\n\nThe athletes had largely put their trust in organizers to ensure that the water quality was safe for them. Women's silver medal winner Julie Derron of Switzerland said the athletes believed that the race was safe based on the word of authorities.\n\n\"The swimming was fine during the race. We know that they took samples this morning. They take a lot of time to analyze, so we don't know the results obviously. We all trust the authorities and the organizers that they keep us safe. And so we had a safe race today,\" she said.\n\nAfter the race, men's gold medal winner Alex Yee was complimentary to the organizers.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have probably the most beautiful venue of any race in the Olympics. And I guess that came with a small penalty of the risk of the Seine being dirty,\" he said.\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris last weekend, drenching the opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was canceled for two straight days last week after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that the races would go ahead as planned.\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) had been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races took place with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nThe mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday Aug.4, 2024 that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon at the Paris Olympics after one of its competitors who swam in the Seine River fell ill. Claire Michel, who competed in the women's triathlon Wednesday, \"is unfortunately ill and will have to withdraw from the competition,\" the Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee said in a statement.\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Olympic triathletes plunged into the Seine River Monday morning as the mixed relay event got underway after days of uncertainty over water quality in the long-polluted Paris waterway.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one. Swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nRepresentatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities met Sunday night to review water tests. The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning, they said in a statement.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. It was not clear whether her illness had anything to do with her swim in the Seine.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on infrastructure improvements to clean up the river that flows through its center. That included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nHeavy rains that have fallen off and on during the Games have caused headaches for organizers as they result in elevated levels of fecal bacteria, including E. coli and enterococci, flowing into the river.\n\nBut organizers have continued to express confidence that warm temperatures and the sun's ultraviolet rays would combine to kill enough of the germs ahead of each event set to include a swim in the Seine.\n\nAthletes swam in the river for the men's and women's individual triathlons Wednesday, though the men's race had been delayed by a day because of the water quality. Elevated bacteria levels in the waterway have caused cancellations of the swimming portion of training sessions for the relay event.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay involves four-person teams made up of two men and two women, with each athlete swimming for 300 meters (yards), cycling for 6.8 kilometers (4.2 miles) and running for 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

And I guess that came with a small penalty of the risk of the Seine being dirty,\" he said.\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris last weekend, drenching the opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was canceled for two straight days last week after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that the races would go ahead as planned.\n\nSeine clean-up\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) had been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races took place with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nThe mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente, Kevin Dotson and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The BOIC did not provide more details about the illness.\n\nBelgium's withdrawal from Monday's race comes amid longstanding concerns about water quality in the Seine ahead of the Paris Olympics. Years of preparation and billions of dollars of technology went into readying the Seine, which had been illegal to swim in since 1923, for competition. But organizers canceled two training sessions and postponed the men's triathlon by a day due to elevated bacteria levels before the women's and men's triathlons were both completed on Wednesday.\n\nSince then, organizers canceled the swimming portion of the planned familiarization sessions for the mixed triathlon relay on Saturday and Sunday, deeming pollution levels were too high for competitors to practice.\n\n\"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for the next triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games,\" the BOIC said. \"We are thinking here of the guarantee of training days, competition days and the competition format which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes, the entourage and the supporters.\"\n\nThe IOC and World Triathlon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOrganizers cited heavy rain and the \"expected drop in water quality\" as the reason for canceling the familiarization sessions this weekend. Similarly, the increase in E. coli levels in the river before the men's and women's triathlons could largely be traced back to the rain that also hampered the Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nMichel, a two-time Belgian triathlon athlete of the year, finished 38th in the women's triathlon on Wednesday.

Additional details on Michel's condition were not immediately available.\n\nTriathletes raced in the river Wednesday, and testing will determine whether upcoming competitions will happen as planned, including the triathlon mixed relay Monday and the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who competed in the Seine three days earlier, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to his swim in the river and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes reported stomach problems.\n\nBacteria levels in the river fluctuate constantly, and daily water samples are tested so organizers can assess the risk and determine whether swims in the long-polluted Paris waterway should go forward.\n\nWhy do bacteria levels matter?\n\nHigh levels of E. coli and enterococci indicate sewage or fecal pollution in the water. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or intestines can result.\n\nHow susceptible a person is to falling ill from E. coli exposure depends on several factors, chief among them a person's age and general health.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the healthier you are, the more likely you're going to be to withstand any sort of pathogen,\" said Brian Rahm, a biological and environmental engineering expert at Cornell University.\n\nSometimes it's not even the E. coli itself that's cause for worry, Rahm said. \"When we see E. coli in the water, it indicates that other types of pathogens and other bacteria, viruses may also be in the water.\"\n\nTesting helps organizers assess the risk to athletes, but it's difficult to quantify the exact risk using that data, said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is not much to do prior to exposure to reduce the risk,\" Duran said.\n\nWhy do bacteria levels change?\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is linked closely to the weather. Heavy rains cause wastewater and runoff to flow into the river, causing bacteria levels to rise, while the sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria.\n\nAnd Paris has seen several downpours during the Games so far.\n\nTo deal with those contingencies, Paris made 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements ahead of the Olympics, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said those improvements have made a big difference.\n\n\"We'll never keep rain events from having an impact on the water quality. That's not possible,\" he said. \"What we've done will allow us to return to a water quality that is satisfactory and good, like it was for the triathlon.\"\n\nOrganizers have canceled multiple test swims this weekend and last week meant to let triathletes familiarize themselves with the course over water quality concerns following rain. The men's triathlon was postponed by a day, then went ahead Wednesday, the same day as the women's race.\n\nFor Monday's triathlon mixed relay, if the water quality isn't at safe levels, organizers can delay to Tuesday. If concerns persist, the swim will be scrapped and the athletes will just compete in the running and cycling portions of the race.\n\nHow is water quality deemed safe if it rains the day of the race?\n\nDecisions on whether to cancel an event are made in the wee hours of the morning on race day, and that's what is expected to happen for Monday's triathlon mixed relay. Organizers consider samples taken from the river 21 and a half hours earlier to allow time for cultures to develop in a lab.\n\nRabadan said infrastructure improvements prevent wastewater from flowing into the Seine. It rained Wednesday as the triathletes competed. Wastewater entering the river upstream would take several hours to reach Paris, meaning that the water quality levels were still safe at the time of that race, he said.\n\nSince then, there was a heavy downpour Thursday night and it also rained Saturday evening.\n\nParis 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps said Sunday that organizers are \"hopeful that we can organize the competition tomorrow, and we will take the decision, as planned, tomorrow morning.\"\n\nWhat do the tests consider?\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon in an email called the European Union's 2006 directive \"the most complete guidelines for bathing water,\" based on the range of factors it takes into account. Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren't suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.\n\nAre the tests used during the Games sufficient?\n\nDan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, says the tests have \"shortcomings\" and \"undercount severely the bacteria.\"\n\nFluidion is testing the water several times a day, and Angelescu said, \"What we see is that water quality is not as good as those measurement data that the city publishes,\" resulting in \"an underestimation of the actual risk.\"\n\nThe company measures both \"free floating\" bacteria in the water and takes a \"comprehensive\" level that Angelescu says also includes bacteria attached to fecal or sediment particles. He said the comprehensive count provides a more complete picture than the lab test the city is using.\n\nHe likened it to watching a busy road with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars and buses and trying to count all the people. The city's method, he said, is akin to counting from a helicopter and weighting each person or vehicle equally because you can't see how many people are inside each car or bus. He says his comprehensive test is more like a police officer stopping each vehicle and counting each person inside the cars and buses to get a complete count.\n\nAngelescu said he discussed these discrepancies with city officials and that they decided to continue with the standard laboratory method they had been using, which complies with regulations. That was a \"fair decision in view of the regulations,\" he said. \"The problem is the regulations are wrong.\"\n\nRahm of Cornell University said that, ultimately, \"from a public health perspective. it doesn't matter whether it's free flowing or trapped inside a dirt particle. It's going to get inside your body one way or another.\"", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wgntv.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enterococcus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villanova University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/08/AP24213813201792-e1722793075285.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nRepresentatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities met Sunday night to review water tests. The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning, they said in a statement.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal, with the United States taking silver and Britain clinching bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. It was not clear whether her illness had anything to do with her swim in the Seine.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on infrastructure improvements to clean up the river that flows through its center. That included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nHeavy rains that have fallen off and on during the Games have caused headaches for organizers as they result in elevated levels of fecal bacteria, including E. coli and enterococci, flowing into the river. Drenching rains fell Thursday night, but conditions had otherwise been dry except for light rain Saturday evening. The sun shone brightly as the race unfolded Monday and athletes said organizers reassured them that there were no concerns with water quality.\n\nOrganizers have continued to express confidence that warm temperatures and the sun's ultraviolet rays would combine to kill enough of the germs ahead of each event set to include a swim in the Seine.\n\nAthletes swam in the river for the men's and women's individual triathlons Wednesday, though the men's race had been delayed by a day because of the water quality. Elevated bacteria levels in the waterway have caused cancellations of the swimming portion of training sessions for the relay event.\n\nAmerican triathlete Taylor Spivey said the uncertainty was difficult.\n\n\"I mean, everyone watching can see what an incredible venue this was for, for the triathlon,\" she said, noting that organizers clearly chose the course location for the backdrop of Paris monuments, which included the Eiffel Tower and the Champs-Elysees. \"But the constant question of the water quality, the water quality and the current, was very stressful for the athletes, I would say, because there the contingency plan was only to push the race back, not necessarily like a plan B location.\"\n\nHer teammate, Morgan Pearson, said the last-minute changes in plans were unfair to the athletes and fans. He also was tired of talking about the water quality in the Seine: \"I've been getting asked this question for the last year. I qualified a year ago, and I think, no pun intended, we're all just a little bit sick of the question.\"\n\nBrazilian triathlete Arnold Djenyfer said the water was fine Monday.\n\n\"There was really no difference about the quality of the water today compared to the first race,\" he said. \"We already knew what we were going to face and it was all fine.\"\n\nVetle Bergsvik Thorn of Norway, who competed Monday, was one of several triathletes who fell ill after swimming in the Seine last Wednesday. He said he had a bad stomach illness for about 12 hours but said \"it's hard to say if it's the river or just some ordinary food poisoning.\"\n\n\"It's been quite a few stressful days with not knowing if we can swim or not,\" he said.\n\nSwiss officials announced Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who had competed in the Seine on Wednesday, would not compete Monday after falling ill with a stomach infection. On Sunday, they announced that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine.\n\nSwitzerland's Julie Derron, who won silver in the women's individual triathlon, said the team had experienced \"a bit of turbulence\" in recent days. But she said that, overall, the experience has been a good one.\n\n\"I think it was challenging conditions obviously, to hold the race, but I think the pictures, the memories that we take away, they're incredible,\" she said.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay involves four-person teams made up of two men and two women, with each athlete swimming for 300 meters (yards), cycling for 6.8 kilometers (4.2 miles) and running for 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news",

forced to withdraw from events at Paris 2024 after swimming in the River Seine.\n\nThere have been concerns about the water quality of the river running through the centre of Paris ever since the Games kicked off last month - so much so that organizers delayed triathlon events due to contamination.\n\nRaces have since taken place in the water, but now two of the athletes who swam in the Seine have had to withdraw from events due to illness.\n\nBelgium's Claire Michel finished 38th in the women's triathlon last week, but she since became too ill to take part in the mixed triathlon which took place today (August 5).\n\nAs a result, Belgium was forced to withdraw its entire team from the event.\n\nIn a statement, the country said it hopes 'that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games'.\n\n\"We are thinking here of the guarantee of training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes, entourage and supporters,\" they added.\n\nMeanwhile, Swiss triathlete Adrien Briffod has been struggling with a stomach infection and consequently also had to withdraw from the team relay.\n\nNeither country have confirmed whether the illness are linked to the river, however, reports in Belgium have suggested Michel was infected with E. coli - a bacteria which can make you ill with diarrhea, vomiting and a fever.\n\nThe Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee has not elaborated on Michel's illness.\n\nMeanwhile, the Switzerland Olympic team said it was 'impossible to say' if Briffod's illness was a result of his swim in the River Seine.\n\nThe mixed relay ultimately went ahead today after organizers assured that bacteria levels in the river were at a level considered safe for athletes.\n\nThere were previously concerns the race could be pushed back after heavy rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused levels of bacteria in the water to rise once again.\n\nGermany managed to secure the gold medal in the event, followed by the US with silver and the UK with bronze.\n\nMorgan Pearson, who competed in the event for the US, described the water as 'quite brown'.\n\nHe also admitted to having some reservations ahead of the event, saying: \"We were looking out the window constantly thinking: 'Oh no, it's raining again'.\"\n\nWater samples of the Seine are being taken daily during the Olympics so organizers can assess the risks of swimming in the river.", "source": {"uri": "unilad.com", "dataType": "news",

Belgian newspaper De Standaard claimed that Michel was infected with E.coli. TIME is out to Team Belgium for comment.\n\nThe water quality of the Seine has been subject to intense scrutiny after French officials announced it would be used for a number of Olympic events, despite a swimming ban that's been in place because of water pollution since 1923. Organizers invested some $1.5 billion to help clean up the iconic river, prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to promise he would swim in the Seine to highlight its cleanliness. Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, swam in a cleaned-up Seine just nine days before the opening ceremonies, which also took place on the river.\n\nAlthough officials remained adamant that water quality levels would meet the mark, in July, water testing still displayed levels of bacteria, including E.coli and enterococcus, at unsafe levels. The Seine also failed to reach the World Triathlon's water standards for swimming during the Olympics, causing the postponement of the men's triathlon and athletes' training sessions, including one for the upcoming triathlon on Monday. Team USA triathlete Seth Rider even jokingly said that he was intentionally exposing himself to E.coli prior to the July 31 race.\n\nTo win the triathlon, athletes must tackle a 300m swim, 7km bike ride, and 1.8km run. The women's and men's individual triathlon took place on July 31, but the mixed relay is slated for Monday, Aug. 5.\n\nBelgium won bronze at the Paris test event for the mixed relay in 2023. \"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions,\" said Team Belgium. \"We are thinking of training days that can be guaranteed, competition days and formats that are clear in advance and circumstances that do not cause uncertainty among athletes, entourage and fans.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Standaard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De Standaard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/b87b3a8f0ac31dc5caff48603faaece5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1690, "textEnd": 1697, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1899, "textEnd": 1905}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nRepresentatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities met Sunday night to review water tests. The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning, they said in a statement.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal, with the United States taking silver and Britain clinching bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. It was not clear whether her illness had anything to do with her swim in the Seine.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on infrastructure improvements to clean up the river that flows through its center. That included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nHeavy rains that have fallen off and on during the Games have caused headaches for organizers as they result in elevated levels of fecal bacteria, including E. coli and enterococci, flowing into the river. Drenching rains fell Thursday night, but conditions had otherwise been dry except for light rain Saturday evening. The sun shone brightly as the race unfolded Monday and athletes said organizers reassured them that there were no concerns with water quality.\n\nOrganizers have continued to express confidence that warm temperatures and the sun's ultraviolet rays would combine to kill enough of the germs ahead of each event set to include a swim in the Seine.\n\nAthletes swam in the river for the men's and women's individual triathlons Wednesday, though the men's race had been delayed by a day because of the water quality. Elevated bacteria levels in the waterway have caused cancellations of the swimming portion of training sessions for the relay event.\n\n\"There was really no difference about the quality of the water today compared to the first race,\" Brazilian triathlete Arnold Djenyfer said after the race. \"We already knew what we were going to face and it was all fine.\"\n\nVetle Bergsvik Thorn of Norway, who competed Monday, was one of several triathletes who fell ill after swimming in the Seine last Wednesday. He said he had a bad stomach illness for about 12 hours but said \"it's hard to say if it's the river or just some ordinary food poisoning.\"\n\n\"It's been quite a few stressful days with not knowing if we can swim or not,\" he said.\n\nSwiss officials announced Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who had competed in the Seine on Wednesday, would not compete Monday after falling ill with a stomach infection. On Sunday, they announced that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine.\n\nSwitzerland's Julie Derron, who won silver in the women's individual triathlon, said the team had experienced \"a bit of turbulence\" in recent days. But she said that, overall, the experience has been a good one.\n\n\"I think it was challenging conditions obviously, to hold the race, but I think the pictures, the memories that we take away, they're incredible,\" she said.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay involves four-person teams made up of two men and two women, with each athlete swimming for 300 meters (yards), cycling for 6.8 kilometers (4.2 miles) and running for 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).", "source": {"uri": "wthr.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Olympic triathletes plunged into the Seine River Monday morning as the mixed relay event got underway after organizers said the bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nParis, Aug 5 (AP) Olympic triathletes plunged into the Seine River Monday morning as the mixed relay event got underway after organizers said the bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one. Swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nAlso Read | Chelsea's Conor Gallagher Agrees to 33 Million Euro Move to Atletico Madrid: Report.\n\nRepresentatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities met Sunday night to review water tests. The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning, they said in a statement.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal, with the United States taking silver and Britain clinching bronze.\n\nAlso Read | Taapsee Pannu Enjoys Paris Olympics With Husband Mathias Boe, Shares Playful Hockey Moments (Watch Videos).\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. It was not clear whether her illness had anything to do with her swim in the Seine.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on infrastructure improvements to clean up the river that flows through its center. That included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nHeavy rains that have fallen off and on during the Games have caused headaches for organizers as they result in elevated levels of fecal bacteria, including E. coli and enterococci, flowing into the river. Drenching rains fell Thursday night, but conditions had otherwise been dry except for light rain Saturday evening. The sun shone brightly as the race unfolded Monday and athletes said organizers reassured them that there were no concerns with water quality.\n\nOrganizers have continued to express confidence that warm temperatures and the sun's ultraviolet rays would combine to kill enough of the germs ahead of each event set to include a swim in the Seine.\n\nAthletes swam in the river for the men's and women's individual triathlons Wednesday, though the men's race had been delayed by a day because of the water quality. Elevated bacteria levels in the waterway have caused cancellations of the swimming portion of training sessions for the relay event.\n\nAmerican triathlete Taylor Spivey said the uncertainty was difficult.\n\n\"I mean, everyone watching can see what an incredible venue this was for, for the triathlon,\" she said, noting that organizers clearly chose the course location for the backdrop of Paris monuments, which included the Eiffel Tower and the Champs-Elysees. \"But the constant question of the water quality, the water quality and the current, was very stressful for the athletes, I would say, because there the contingency plan was only to push the race back, not necessarily like a plan B location.\"\n\nHer teammate, Morgan Pearson, said the last-minute changes in plans were unfair to the athletes and fans. He also was tired of talking about the water quality in the Seine: \"I've been getting asked this question for the last year. I qualified a year ago, and I think, no pun intended, we're all just a little bit sick of the question.\"\n\nBrazilian triathlete Arnold Djenyfer said the water was fine Monday.\n\n\"There was really no difference about the quality of the water today compared to the first race,\" he said. \"We already knew what we were going to face and it was all fine.\"\n\nVetle Bergsvik Thorn of Norway, who competed Monday, was one of several triathletes who fell ill after swimming in the Seine last Wednesday. He said he had a bad stomach illness for about 12 hours but said \"it's hard to say if it's the river or just some ordinary food poisoning.\"\n\n\"It's been quite a few stressful days with not knowing if we can swim or not,\" he said.\n\nSwiss officials announced Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who had competed in the Seine on Wednesday, would not compete Monday after falling ill with a stomach infection. On Sunday, they announced that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine.\n\nSwitzerland's Julie Derron, who won silver in the women's individual triathlon, said the team had experienced \"a bit of turbulence\" in recent days. But she said that, overall, the experience has been a good one.\n\n\"I think it was challenging conditions obviously, to hold the race, but I think the pictures, the memories that we take away, they're incredible,\" she said.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay involves four-person teams made up of two men and two women, with each athlete swimming for 300 meters (yards), cycling for 6.8 kilometers (4.2 miles) and running for 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).

Laure Boyer/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nBelgium's Olympic team forfeited from Monday's mixed competition triathlon after one of its triathletes, Claire Michel, became sick after swimming in the Seine last Wednesday -- a river that's faced frequent water quality and safety concerns.\n\n\"The Belgian Hammers will not start in the Mixed Relay competition at the Paris Games,\" the Belgian team said in a release. \"Michel, one of the athletes in the mixed relay team, unfortunately has to withdraw from the competition due to illness.\"\n\nWhile the Olympic team did not describe Michel's illness nor blame the Seine, Belgium newspaper De Standaard reported that the triathlete was hospitalized and treated for an E. coli infection Sunday. The bacteria can cause serious intestinal and medical issues.\n\nMeanwhile on Sunday, Olympic organizers canceled a planned practice swim for triathletes after poor water quality test results. In a release obtained by NPR, organizers said \"heavy rains\" on Wednesday and Thursday led to the practice-swim cancellation. Heavy rains can overwhelm the city's antiquated sewer system, leaking untreated sewage into the Seine river -- increasing rates of E. coli bacteria.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Paris Olympic games, France spent more than $1 billion to clean the Seine river, which had been illegal to swim in for more than a century. It has long been considered too contaminated for human use. On July 17, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo jumped into its murky waters and declared, \"we did it!\"\n\nOlympic triathletes -- including Michel -- last competed in the Seine on Wednesday. As it stands, Olympians are set to swim in the Seine on Monday for the mixed competition triathlon, without the Belgian team. Daily river testing will continue ahead of the Monday triathlon and the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions,\" the Belgian team release said. \"We are thinking of training days that can be guaranteed, competition days and formats that are clear in advance and circumstances that do not cause uncertainty among athletes, entourage and fans.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_garrett@npr.org", "name": "Luke Garrett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Standaard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De Standaard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_sewer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanitary sewer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2638x1484+0+275/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2F54%2Fa93a3976468e8fd2ac900291ce25%2Fgettyimages-2164138275.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 101, "textEnd": 108}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 1559, "textEnd": 1566}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Belgian newspaper De Standaard claimed that Michel was infected with E.coli. TIME is out to Team Belgium for comment.\n\nThe water quality of the Seine has been subject to intense scrutiny after French officials announced it would be used for a number of Olympic events, despite a swimming ban that's been in place because of water pollution since 1923. Organizers invested some $1.5 billion to help clean up the iconic river, prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to promise he would swim in the Seine to highlight its cleanliness. Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, swam in a cleaned-up Seine just nine days before the opening ceremonies, which also took place on the river.\n\nAlthough officials remained adamant that water quality levels would meet the mark, in July, water testing still displayed levels of bacteria, including E.coli and enterococcus, at unsafe levels. The Seine also failed to reach the World Triathlon's water standards for swimming during the Olympics, causing the postponement of the men's triathlon and athletes' training sessions, including one for the upcoming triathlon on Monday. Team USA triathlete Seth Rider even jokingly said that he was intentionally exposing himself to E.coli prior to the July 31 race.\n\nTo win the triathlon, athletes must tackle a 300m swim, 7km bike ride, and 1.8km run. The women's and men's individual triathlon took place on July 31, but the mixed relay is slated for Monday, Aug. 5.\n\nBelgium won bronze at the Paris test event for the mixed relay in 2023. \"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions,\" said Team Belgium. \"We are thinking of training days that can be guaranteed, competition days and formats that are clear in advance and circumstances that do not cause uncertainty among athletes, entourage and fans.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "solcyre_burga@time.com", "name": "Solcyr\u00e9 Burga", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Standaard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De Standaard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 36}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/claire-michael-seine-triathlon-paris-olympics.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1533, "textEnd": 1540, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1742, "textEnd": 1748}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The statement did not elaborate on Michel's illness but it comes after concerns over the river's water quality. Organizers had said that water quality tests done the day of the individual triathlon races showed \"very good\" bacteria levels.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli, in the Seine's waters. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast when determining whether to go forward with a race. The decisions are made at early morning meetings on the day of the event.\n\nThe Belgian committee said it \"hopes that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games. We are thinking here of the guarantee of training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes, entourage and supporters.\"\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who also competed in the Seine on Wednesday, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to the swim and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes had reported stomach problems.\n\nSwiss officials said in an update Sunday that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine, the statement said. The Swiss team still planned to compete in the mixed relay Monday.\n\nNorwegian triathlete Vetle Bergsvik Thorn got sick a day after competing in the men's triathlon. Thorn told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that he woke up the next day with an upset stomach and was vomiting but thought that the likely cause was food poisoning. He said he felt better later that day and was planning on competing again in the mixed relay scheduled for Monday.\n\nArild Tveiten, the sports director of the Norwegian Triathlon Federation, said the cause of Thorn's illness was unclear.\n\n\"We're thinking what everyone is thinking: that it's probably the river. But we don't know. It could be the river, it could be the chicken,\" Tveiten told NRK. \"The doctor is leaning toward the possibility of food poisoning.

Swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nRepresentatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities met Sunday night to review water tests. The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning, they said in a statement.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal, with the United States taking silver and Britain clinching bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. It was not clear whether her illness had anything to do with her swim in the Seine.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on infrastructure improvements to clean up the river that flows through its center. That included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nHeavy rains that have fallen off and on during the Games have caused headaches for organizers as they result in elevated levels of fecal bacteria, including E. coli and enterococci, flowing into the river. Drenching rains fell Thursday night, but conditions had otherwise been dry except for light rain Saturday evening. The sun shone brightly as the race unfolded Monday and athletes said organizers reassured them that there were no concerns with water quality.\n\nOrganizers have continued to express confidence that warm temperatures and the sun's ultraviolet rays would combine to kill enough of the germs ahead of each event set to include a swim in the Seine.\n\nAthletes swam in the river for the men's and women's individual triathlons Wednesday, though the men's race had been delayed by a day because of the water quality. Elevated bacteria levels in the waterway have caused cancellations of the swimming portion of training sessions for the relay event.\n\n\"There was really no difference about the quality of the water today compared to the first race,\" Brazilian triathlete Arnold Djenyfer said after the race. \"We already knew what we were going to face and it was all fine.\"\n\nVetle Bergsvik Thorn of Norway, who competed Monday, was one of several triathletes who fell ill after swimming in the Seine last Wednesday. He said he had a bad stomach illness for about 12 hours but said \"it's hard to say if it's the river or just some ordinary food poisoning.\"\n\n\"It's been quite a few stressful days with not knowing if we can swim or not,\" he said.\n\nSwiss officials announced Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who had competed in the Seine on Wednesday, would not compete Monday after falling ill with a stomach infection. On Sunday, they announced that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine.\n\nSwitzerland's Julie Derron, who won silver in the women's individual triathlon, said the team had experienced \"a bit of turbulence\" in recent days. But she said that, overall, the experience has been a good one.\n\n\"I think it was challenging conditions obviously, to hold the race, but I think the pictures, the memories that we take away, they're incredible,\" she said.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay involves four-person teams made up of two men and two women, with each athlete swimming for 300 meters (yards), cycling for 6.8 kilometers (4.2 miles) and running for 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).", "source": {"uri": "13wmaz.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nRepresentatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities met Sunday night to review water tests. The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning, they said in a statement.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal, with the United States taking silver and Britain clinching bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. It was not clear whether her illness had anything to do with her swim in the Seine.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on infrastructure improvements to clean up the river that flows through its center. That included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nHeavy rains that have fallen off and on during the Games have caused headaches for organizers as they result in elevated levels of fecal bacteria, including E. coli and enterococci, flowing into the river. Drenching rains fell Thursday night, but conditions had otherwise been dry except for light rain Saturday evening. The sun shone brightly as the race unfolded Monday and athletes said organizers reassured them that there were no concerns with water quality.\n\nOrganizers have continued to express confidence that warm temperatures and the sun's ultraviolet rays would combine to kill enough of the germs ahead of each event set to include a swim in the Seine.\n\nAthletes swam in the river for the men's and women's individual triathlons Wednesday, though the men's race had been delayed by a day because of the water quality. Elevated bacteria levels in the waterway have caused cancellations of the swimming portion of training sessions for the relay event.\n\nAmerican triathlete Taylor Spivey said the uncertainty was difficult.\n\n\"I mean, everyone watching can see what an incredible venue this was for, for the triathlon,\" she said, noting that organizers clearly chose the course location for the backdrop of Paris monuments, which included the Eiffel Tower and the Champs-Elysees. \"But the constant question of the water quality, the water quality and the current, was very stressful for the athletes, I would say, because there the contingency plan was only to push the race back, not necessarily like a plan B location.\"\n\nHer teammate, Morgan Pearson, said the last-minute changes in plans were unfair to the athletes and fans. He also was tired of talking about the water quality in the Seine: \"I've been getting asked this question for the last year. I qualified a year ago, and I think, no pun intended, we're all just a little bit sick of the question.\"\n\nBrazilian triathlete Arnold Djenyfer said the water was fine Monday.\n\n\"There was really no difference about the quality of the water today compared to the first race,\" he said. \"We already knew what we were going to face and it was all fine.\"\n\nVetle Bergsvik Thorn of Norway, who competed Monday, was one of several triathletes who fell ill after swimming in the Seine last Wednesday. He said he had a bad stomach illness for about 12 hours but said \"it's hard to say if it's the river or just some ordinary food poisoning.\"\n\n\"It's been quite a few stressful days with not knowing if we can swim or not,\" he said.\n\nSwiss officials announced Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who had competed in the Seine on Wednesday, would not compete Monday after falling ill with a stomach infection. On Sunday, they announced that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine.\n\nSwitzerland's Julie Derron, who won silver in the women's individual triathlon, said the team had experienced \"a bit of turbulence\" in recent days. But she said that, overall, the experience has been a good one.\n\n\"I think it was challenging conditions obviously, to hold the race, but I think the pictures, the memories that we take away, they're incredible,\" she said.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay involves four-person teams made up of two men and two women, with each athlete swimming for 300 meters (yards), cycling for 6.8 kilometers (4.2 miles) and running for 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news",

The bacteria can cause serious intestinal and medical issues.\n\nMeanwhile on Sunday, Olympic organizers canceled a planned practice swim for triathletes after poor water quality test results. In a release obtained by NPR, organizers said \"heavy rains\" on Wednesday and Thursday led to the practice-swim cancellation. Heavy rains can overwhelm the city's antiquated sewer system, leaking untreated sewage into the Seine river -- increasing rates of E. coli bacteria.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Paris Olympic games, France spent more than $1 billion to clean the Seine river, which had been illegal to swim in for more than a century. It has long been considered too contaminated for human use. On July 17, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo jumped into its murky waters and declared, \"we did it!\"\n\nOlympic triathletes -- including Michel -- last competed in the Seine on Wednesday. As it stands, Olympians are set to swim in the Seine on Monday for the mixed competition triathlon, without the Belgian team. Daily river testing will continue ahead of the Monday triathlon and the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions,\" the Belgian team release said. \"We are thinking of training days that can be guaranteed, competition days and formats that are clear in advance and circumstances that do not cause uncertainty among athletes, entourage and fans.\"", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Standaard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De Standaard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a62ce5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2345x1231+0+264/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F2345x1759%2038%200%2Fresize%2F2345x1759%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2F54%2Fa93a3976468e8fd2ac900291ce25%2Fgettyimages-2164138275.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 1391, "textEnd": 1398}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Representatives from World Triathlon, Paris 2024, the International Olympic Committee, M\u00e9t\u00e9o France, DRIEAT, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the \u00cele-de-France Region were involved in carrying out water quality tests.\n\nDuring this meeting, World Triathlon took the decision to move ahead with the Mixed Relay competition, scheduled for Monday, 5 August, at 8.00.\n\nThe latest test results confirm that Seine water quality levels at the triathlon venue have improved in recent hours, with forward looking analysis indicating that water quality will be within the levels acceptable by World Triathlon. As a result, World Triathlon has taken the decision this evening to go ahead with the competition.\n\nA Belgian triathlete has fallen ill after taking part in a race that included a stage on the River Seine. The quality of the waters of the iconic Parisian river has been called into question on several occasions before and during the Games, and on Sunday one of training sessions was suspended as Belgian triathlete, Claire Michel's condition worsened.\n\nAccording to the Belgian National Olympic Committee on Sunday, Michel felt unwell after taking part in the women's individual Olympic triathlon on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the participants in a complicated event, fellow Belgian Jolien Vermeylen, described the \"Sunderland River and the Hong Kong World Cup\" as \"much worse water to swim in\".\n\n\"The COIB and Belgian triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games,\" the Belgian Olympic Committee warned in the statement. This situation and the suspension of training for the in-water portion of the triathlon casts doubt on the mixed relay event scheduled for Monday. It is not the only event pending on the river: the men's and women's marathon swims are scheduled for 8 and 9 August.\n\nTraining in the river was interrupted last week, and the men's individual event was postponed due to pollution problems. Many triathletes were caught by surprise by the strong currents in the Seine, with some expressing concerns about water quality and delays affecting their training and the men's competition.\n\nIn this case, Thursday night's heavy storm is suspected to have worsened the water quality of the river, as downpours often cause sewage overflows in the Seine.\n\nHowever, on Saturday night Paris 2024 spokeswoman Anne Descamps said Sunday's training sessions had also been cancelled, due to the rain in recent days and linking Monday's event to confidence in improved weather forecasts.", "source":

The statement did not elaborate on Michel's illness but it comes after concerns over the river's water quality. Organizers had said that water quality tests done the day of the individual triathlon races showed \"very good\" bacteria levels.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli, in the Seine's waters. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast when determining whether to go forward with a race. The decisions are made at early morning meetings on the day of the event.\n\nRELATED: Who is Yusuf Dikec?

But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to the swim and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes had reported stomach problems.\n\nSwiss officials said in an update Sunday that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine, the statement said. The Swiss team still planned to compete in the mixed relay Monday.\n\nNorwegian triathlete Vetle Bergsvik Thorn got sick a day after competing in the men's triathlon. Thorn told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that he woke up the next day with an upset stomach and was vomiting but thought that the likely cause was food poisoning. He said he felt better later that day and was planning on competing again in the mixed relay scheduled for Monday.\n\nArild Tveiten, the sports director of the Norwegian Triathlon Federation, said the cause of Thorn's illness was unclear.\n\n\"We're thinking what everyone is thinking: that it's probably the river. But we don't know. It could be the river, it could be the chicken,\" Tveiten told NRK. \"The doctor is leaning toward the possibility of food poisoning.

separated in a photo finish.\n\nThe relay is a four-person sprint triathlon, with two men and two women completing a 300-metre swim, a seven-kilometre (4.3-mile) bike ride and a 1.8km run.\n\nThe Seine was used for the swim on Monday, as it was for the men's and women's individual triathlon last Wednesday.\n\nBut the river has been dogged by pollution problems despite a 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) upgrade to improve the Paris sewerage and water treatment system.\n\nNo athletes' training in the Seine has been possible since the start of Games after the water repeatedly failed water tests, with bacteria levels above authorised limits.\n\nOn the eve of the mixed relay, the Belgian National Olympic Committee (COIB) revealed that Claire Michel had fallen sick after the women's

Here's the latest on water quality concerns", "body": "The Seine River flows in front of the Pont Alexandre III bridge, site of the triathlon events at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 29, 2024, in Paris. As the Olympics continue in Paris, the Seine River's water quality remains a major area of concern for officials. Organizers of the triathlon event cancelled swimming practice on Monday for the second day in a row because of poor water quality. Event organizers hope sunny weather will make swimming viable on Tuesday when the triathlon begins.\n\nPARIS (AP) -- At the Paris Olympics, whether the water quality in the Seine River is safe enough to host some swimming events has been a major question.\n\nBacteria levels in the river fluctuate constantly, and daily water samples are tested so organizers can assess the risk and determine whether swims in the long-polluted Paris waterway should go forward.\n\nTriathletes raced in the river Wednesday, and testing will determine whether upcoming competitions will happen as planned, including the triathlon mixed relay Monday and the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nHere are some things to know about water quality testing in the Seine:\n\nWhy do bacteria levels matter?\n\nHigh levels of E. coli and enterococci indicate sewage or fecal pollution in the water. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or intestines can result.\n\nHow susceptible a person is to falling ill from E. coli exposure depends on several factors, chief among them a person's age and general health.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the healthier you are, the more likely you're going to be to withstand any sort of pathogen,\" said Brian Rahm, a biological and environmental engineering expert at Cornell University.\n\nSometimes it's not even the E. coli itself that's cause for worry, Rahm said. \"When we see E. coli in the water, it indicates that other types of pathogens and other bacteria, viruses may also be in the water.\"\n\nTesting helps organizers assess the risk to athletes, but it's difficult to quantify the exact risk using that data, said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is not much to do prior to exposure to reduce the risk,\" Duran said.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who competed in the Seine three days earlier, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to his swim in the river and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes reported stomach problems.\n\nWhy do bacteria levels change?\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is linked closely to the weather. Heavy rains cause wastewater and runoff to flow into the river, causing bacteria levels to rise, while the sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria.\n\nAnd Paris has seen several downpours during the Games so far.\n\nTo deal with those contingencies, Paris made 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements ahead of the Olympics, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said those improvements have made a big difference.\n\n\"We'll never keep rain events from having an impact on the water quality. That's not possible,\" he said. \"What we've done will allow us to return to a water quality that is satisfactory and good, like it was for the triathlon.\"\n\nOrganizers have canceled multiple test swims this weekend and last week meant to let triathletes familiarize themselves with the course over water quality concerns following rain. The men's triathlon was postponed by a day, then went ahead Wednesday, the same day as the women's race.\n\nFor Monday's triathlon mixed relay, if the water quality isn't at safe levels, organizers can delay to Tuesday. If concerns persist, the swim will be scrapped and the athletes will just compete in the running and cycling portions of the race.\n\nHow is water quality deemed safe if it ra\n\nins the day of the race?\n\nDecisions on whether to cancel an event are made in the wee hours of the morning on race day, and that's what is expected to happen for Monday's triathlon mixed relay. Organizers consider samples taken from the river 21 and a half hours earlier to allow time for cultures to develop in a lab.\n\nRabadan said infrastructure improvements prevent wastewater from flowing into the Seine. It rained Wednesday as the triathletes competed. Wastewater entering the river upstream would take several hours to reach Paris, meaning that the water quality levels were still safe at the time of that race, he said.\n\nSince then, there was a heavy downpour Thursday night and it also rained Saturday evening.\n\nParis 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps said Sunday that organizers are \"hopeful that we can organize the competition tomorrow, and we will take the decision, as planned, tomorrow morning.\"\n\nWhat do the tests consider?\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon in an email called the European Union's 2006 directive \"the most complete guidelines for bathing water,\" based on the range of factors it takes into account. Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren't suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.\n\nAre the tests used during the Games sufficient?\n\nDan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, says the tests have \"shortcomings\" and \"undercount severely the bacteria.\"\n\nFluidion is testing the water several times a day, and Angelescu said, \"What we see is that water quality is not as good as those measurement data that the city publishes,\" resulting in \"an underestimation of the actual risk.\"\n\nThe company measures both \"free floating\" bacteria in the water and takes a \"comprehensive\" level that Angelescu says also includes bacteria attached to fecal or sediment particles. He said the comprehensive count provides a more complete picture than the lab test the city is using.\n\nHe likened it to watching a busy road with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars and buses and trying to count all the people. The city's method, he said, is akin to counting from a helicopter and weighting each person or vehicle equally because you can't see how many people are inside each car or bus. He says his comprehensive test is more like a police officer stopping each vehicle and counting each person inside the cars and buses to get a complete count.\n\nAngelescu said he discussed these discrepancies with city officials and that they decided to continue with the standard laboratory method they had been using, which complies with regulations. That was a \"fair decision in view of the regulations,\" he said. \"The problem is the regulations are wrong.\"\n\nRahm of Cornell University said that, ultimately, \"from a public health perspective. it doesn't matter whether it's free flowing or trapped inside a dirt particle. It's going to get inside your body one way or another.\"\n\nNaishadham reported from Washington.

Swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nRepresentatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities met Sunday night to review water tests. The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning, they said in a statement.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium\u00b4s Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. It was not clear whether her illness had anything to do with her swim in the Seine.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on infrastructure improvements to clean up the river that flows through its center. That included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nHeavy rains that have fallen off and on during the Games have caused headaches for organizers as they result in elevated levels of fecal bacteria, including E. coli and enterococci, flowing into the river. Drenching rains fell Thursday night, but conditions had otherwise been dry except for light rain Saturday evening. The sun shone brightly as the race unfolded Monday and athletes said organizers reassured them that there were no concerns with water quality.\n\nAthletes dive into the water for the start of the mixed relay triathlon at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Paris, France.

Here's the...", "body": "PARIS (AP) - At the Paris Olympics, whether the water quality in the Seine River is safe enough to host some swimming events has been a major question.\n\nBacteria levels in the river fluctuate constantly, and daily water samples are tested so organizers can assess the risk and determine whether swims in the long-polluted Paris waterway should go forward.\n\nTriathletes raced in the river Wednesday, and testing will determine whether upcoming competitions will happen as planned, including the triathlon mixed relay Monday and the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nHere are some things to know about water quality testing in the Seine:\n\nHigh levels of E. coli and enterococci indicate sewage or fecal pollution in the water. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or intestines can result.\n\nAthletes compete in the swimming race in the Seine River during the women's individual triathlon at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, in Paris, France. (Martin Bureau/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nHow susceptible a person is to falling ill from E. coli exposure depends on several factors, chief among them a person\u00b4s age and general health.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the healthier you are, the more likely you\u00b4re going to be to withstand any sort of pathogen,\" said Brian Rahm, a biological and environmental engineering expert at Cornell University.\n\nSometimes it's not even the E. coli itself that's cause for worry, Rahm said. \"When we see E. coli in the water, it indicates that other types of pathogens and other bacteria, viruses may also be in the water.\"\n\nTesting helps organizers assess the risk to athletes, but it's difficult to quantify the exact risk using that data, said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is not much to do prior to exposure to reduce the risk,\" Duran said.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who competed in the Seine three days earlier, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to his swim in the river and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes reported stomach problems.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is linked closely to the weather. Heavy rains cause wastewater and runoff to flow into the river, causing bacteria levels to rise, while the sun\u00b4s ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria.\n\nAnd Paris has seen several downpours during the Games so far.\n\nTo deal with those contingencies, Paris made 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements ahead of the Olympics, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said those improvements have made a big difference.\n\n\"We'll never keep rain events from having an impact on the water quality. That's not possible,\" he said. \"What we've done will allow us to return to a water quality that is satisfactory and good, like it was for the triathlon.\"\n\nOrganizers have canceled multiple test swims this weekend and last week meant to let triathletes familiarize themselves with the course over water quality concerns following rain. The men's triathlon was postponed by a day, then went ahead Wednesday, the same day as the women's race.\n\nFor Monday's triathlon mixed relay, if the water quality isn\u00b4t at safe levels, organizers can delay to Tuesday. If concerns persist, the swim will be scrapped and the athletes will just compete in the running and cycling portions of the race.\n\nDecisions on whether to cancel an event are made in the wee hours of the morning on race day, and that's what is expected to happen for Monday\u00b4s triathlon mixed relay. Organizers consider samples taken from the river 21 and a half hours earlier to allow time for cultures to develop in a lab.\n\nRabadan said infrastructure improvements prevent wastewater from flowing into the Seine. It rained Wednesday as the triathletes competed. Wastewater entering the river upstream would take several hours to reach Paris, meaning that the water quality levels were still safe at the time of that race, he said.\n\nSince then, there was a heavy downpour Thursday night and it also rained Saturday evening.\n\nParis 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps said Sunday that organizers are \"hopeful that we can organize the competition tomorrow, and we will take the decision, as planned, tomorrow morning.\"\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon\u00b4s water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon\u00b4s guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon in an email called the European Union\u00b4s 2006 directive \"the most complete guidelines for bathing water,\" based on the range of factors it takes into account. Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren\u00b4t suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon\u00b4s medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.\n\nDan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, says the tests have \"shortcomings\" and \"undercount severely the bacteria.\"\n\nFluidion is testing the water several times a day, and Angelescu said, \"What we see is that water quality is not as good as those measurement data that the city publishes,\" resulting in \"an underestimation of the actual risk.\"\n\nThe company measures both \"free floating\" bacteria in the water and takes a \"comprehensive\" level that Angelescu says also includes bacteria attached to fecal or sediment particles. He said the comprehensive count provides a more complete picture than the lab test the city is using.\n\nHe likened it to watching a busy road with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars and buses and trying to count all the people. The city\u00b4s method, he said, is akin to counting from a helicopter and weighting each person or vehicle equally because you can\u00b4t see how many people are inside each car or bus. He says his comprehensive test is more like a police officer stopping each vehicle and counting each person inside the cars and buses to get a complete count.\n\nAngelescu said he discussed these discrepancies with city officials and that they decided to continue with the standard laboratory method they had been using, which complies with regulations. That was a \"fair decision in view of the regulations,\" he said. \"The problem is the regulations are wrong.\"\n\nRahm of Cornell University said that, ultimately, \"from a public health perspective. it doesn\u00b4t matter whether it\u00b4s free flowing or trapped inside a dirt particle. It\u00b4s going to get inside your body one way or another.\"\n\nNaishadham reported from Washington.

Swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nRepresentatives from World Triathlon and the International Olympic Committee along with Paris Games organizers and regional and weather authorities met Sunday night to review water tests. The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning, they said in a statement.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. It was not clear whether her illness had anything to do with her swim in the Seine.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on infrastructure improvements to clean up the river that flows through its center. That included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nHeavy rains that have fallen off and on during the Games have caused headaches for organizers as they result in elevated levels of fecal bacteria, including E. coli and enterococci, flowing into the river. Drenching rains fell Thursday night, but conditions had otherwise been dry except for light rain Saturday evening. The sun shone brightly as the race unfolded Monday and athletes said organizers reassured them that there were no concerns with water quality.\n\nOrganizers have continued to express confidence that warm temperatures and the sun's ultraviolet rays would combine to kill enough of the germs ahead of each event set to include a swim in the Seine.\n\nAthletes swam in the river for the men's and women's individual triathlons Wednesday, though the men's race had been delayed by a day because of the water quality.

Obviously it wasn't the best preparation for today.\"\n\nThe relay is a four-person sprint triathlon, with Monday's race seeing two men and two women completing a 300-metre swim in the Seine, a seven-kilometre (4.3-mile) bike ride through central Paris and a 1.8 km run.\n\nThe Seine has been the focus of attention during the Paris triathlon events with the waterway consistently failing water quality tests despite a 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) upgrade to improve the Paris sewerage and water treatment systems.\n\nThe men's race last week had to be delayed by 24 hours and no training has been possible since the start of the Games on July 28, with many athletes again surprised by the strength of the current on Monday.\n\n\"It takes some courage to swim and the ability of a good swimmer to navigate it,\" victorious German Tim Hellwig told reporters.\n\nOrganisers have stressed that the illnesses cannot be attributed to the Seine and Hellwig said he felt confident in the water tests overseen by international governing body World Triathlon.\n\n\"No-one was afraid to jump in. We were all happy to have a race,\" he added, saying that he woke up fine after last week's men's event.\n\n\"If like 99 percent of the athletes don't have any problems, I think it's fine,\" he said.\n\n- Safety -\n\nOn the eve of Monday's relay, the Belgian National Olympic Committee (COIB) revealed that Michel had fallen sick in a statement that also criticised the organisation of the triathlon at the Paris Games.\n\n\"The COIB and Belgian Triathlon hope that the lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympics,\" the committee said.\n\nOther racers have also expressed frustration that decisions on whether the river could be used for the training and competitions were taken in the middle of the night, while organisers had threatened to scrap the swimming leg completely if the river remained too dirty.\n\n\"I don't want to be too negative. However I do think if a situation like this happens again at the Olympics, they should have a backup venue,\" US silver medallist Morgan Pearson told reporters.\n\n\"I don't think any of us are like 'I'm not going to race because of the chance of E. coli'. It's the Olympics. But that shows the liberty they took,\" he added.\n\nHeavy rainstorms overwhelm Paris's sewerage system, leading to discharges of untreated waste water that send levels of bacteria such as E.Coli spiking.\n\nParis has been drenched by two major downpours since the Olympics started, on the night of the opening ceremony and again last Thursday evening.\n\nThe Paris 2024 organising committee said in a statement that testing on the day of the men's and women's triathlon last week had shown that the quality of the water was \"very good\" based on World Triathlon's criteria.\n\n\"The decision on whether to proceed with an event is taken by the international federation, World Triathlon, in coordination with Paris 2024, and based on the test results and a range of (notably health) criteria,\" it said.\n\n\"Paris 2024 wishes to remind everyone that the health and wellbeing of athletes is our top priority,\" it added.\n\nadp/gj", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The decision, like this communication, was taken in consultation with the athletes and their entourage,\" the committee said in a statement.\n\n\"Claire Michel, a member of the relay, is unfortunately ill and must withdraw from the competition,\" it added.\n\nWhile the committee did not elaborate, local media reports have suggested that Michel, who has been hospitalized for four days already, was diagnosed with an E.coli bacterial infection. While the athlete apparently fell ill shortly after finishing 38th in the women's triathlon competition on Wednesday, it has not been positively established that she contracted the bacteria in the murky waters of the Seine.\n\nThe development comes after the Swiss triathlon team said it had to replace triathlete Adrien Briffod with Simon Westermann after the former contracted a gastrointestinal infection. The team noted it was still unclear whether Briffod's illness was related to the Seine.\n\nThe Belgian team has been highly critical of the condition of the Seine, with multiple athletes publicly speaking of their experience. \"While swimming under the bridge, I felt and saw things that we shouldn't think about too much,\" Jolien Vermeylen, who finished 24th in Wednesday's event, said, adding that the waters did not exactly taste like \"Coca-Cola or Sprite.\"\n\n\"The Seine has been dirty for a hundred years, so they can't say the safety of the athletes is a priority,\" she claimed.\n\nThe water condition of the highly-polluted river had been a source of widespread concern long before the Games. A $1.5 billion project aimed at cleaning up the Seine yielded mixed results at best and was marred by various mishaps, including the release of a large quantity of sewage into the river shortly before the Olympics.\n\nThe French authorities, however, insisted on holding open-water competitions on the Seine, with several senior officials, including French Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, taking a swim in the river to demonstrate that it is safe. President Emmanuel Macron, who had also made a half-hearted pledge to take a dip, however, ultimately abstained from doing so.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_water_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open water swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.08/article/66afe9592030275e840e5512.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Drenching rains fell Thursday night, but conditions had otherwise been dry except for light rain Saturday evening. The sun shone brightly as the race unfolded Monday and athletes said organizers reassured them that there were no concerns with water quality.\n\nOrganizers have continued to express confidence that warm temperatures and the sun's ultraviolet rays would combine to kill enough of the germs ahead of each event set to include a swim in the Seine.\n\nAthletes swam in the river for the men's and women's individual triathlons Wednesday, though the men's race had been delayed by a day because of the water quality.

colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay involves four-person teams made up of two men and two women,

Please try again later.\n\nBelgium's mixed triathlon team has pulled out of Monday's race because one of its athletes, who raced in the women's triathlon in the Seine last week, is ill, the country's Olympic committee said, in a statement that called into question organizers' handling of the events.\n\nThe triathlete, 35-year-old Claire Michel, finished 38th in Wednesday's women's individual triathlon. Belgian officials did not provide any details about Michel's illness or directly connect it to the event, which took place despite multiple training sessions being canceled and the men's event being postponed because of pollution in the river.\n\nParis and other municipalities spent 1.4 billion euros on a project to clean the notoriously polluted Seine and make it swimmable for the Olympics.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Belgium's Olympic Committee said it and Belgian Triathlon \"hope that lessons will be learned for the next triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games.\n\nplayPlay now\n\nNaN min\n\nFollow on\n\nPodcast episode\n\nSpotify\n\nApple\n\nGoogle\n\nAmazon\n\n\"We are thinking here of the guarantee of training days, competition days and the competition format which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes, their entourage and the supporters,\" the statement continued.\n\nOfficials at World Triathlon, which oversees Olympic triathlons, and the International Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nIn the days leading up to last week's triathlons, World Triathlon and Paris 2024 officials cancelled practice sessions in the river because E. Coli readings were too high for World Triathlon's standards. Two days of rain on the Games' first weekend had overloaded the city's sewers with rain runoff, a common problem in Paris. Several rainstorms have again raised the river's pollution levels, and World Triathlon cancelled another swim practice Sunday.\n\nAfter last week's triathlons, many of the competitors brushed off fears over the water's quality, saying they were more concerned by the river's rapid current, which left at least one woman saying she was unsure she could finish the race.\n\nOthers were glib. American Taylor Knibb joked with reporters after the women's triathlon, offering to \"grab a cup\" if anyone wished to taste the Seine water.\n\nAt a press conference before the Olympics began, her male teammate Seth Rider said he was preparing to swim in the Seine by strengthening his \"E. coli threshold by exposing myself to a bit of E. coli in your day-to-day life,\" adding that he was no longer washing his hands after going to the bathroom.\" He later said he was joking.\n\nAt a press conference here Sunday, Paris 2024 communications director Anne Descamps said water quality tests are still being conducted daily. She added that the decision to cancel Sunday's mixed triathlon swim training came after examining test results from Saturday, and that a decision on Monday's race would be made that morning.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "les_carpenter@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Les Carpenter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Knibb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Knibb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4AEJHVT5O2ONMRVDARQYAPGMSM.JPG&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Obviously it wasn't the best preparation for today.\"\n\nThe relay is a four-person sprint triathlon, with Monday's race seeing two men and two women completing a 300-metre swim in the Seine, a seven-kilometre (4.3-mile) bike ride through central Paris and a 1.8 km run.\n\nThe Seine has been the focus of attention during the Paris triathlon events with the waterway consistently failing water quality tests despite a 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) upgrade to improve the Paris sewerage and water treatment systems.\n\nThe men's race last week had to be delayed by 24 hours and no training has been possible since the start of the Games on July 28, with many athletes again surprised by the strength of the current on Monday.\n\n\"It takes some courage to swim and the ability of a good swimmer to navigate it,\" victorious German Tim Hellwig told reporters.\n\nOrganisers have stressed that the illnesses cannot be attributed to the Seine and Hellwig said he felt confident in the water tests overseen by international governing body World Triathlon.\n\n\"No-one was afraid to jump in. We were all happy to have a race,\" he added, saying that he woke up fine after last week's men's event.\n\n\"If like 99 percent of the athletes don't have any problems, I think it's fine,\" he said.\n\n- Safety -\n\nOn the eve of Monday's relay, the Belgian National Olympic Committee (COIB) revealed that Michel had fallen sick in a statement that also criticised the organisation of the triathlon at the Paris Games.\n\n\"The COIB and Belgian Triathlon hope that the lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympics,\" the committee said.\n\nOther racers have also expressed frustration that decisions on whether the river could be used for the training and competitions were taken in the middle of the night, while organisers had threatened to scrap the swimming leg completely if the river remained too dirty.\n\n\"I don't want to be too negative. However I do think if a situation like this happens again at the Olympics, they should have a backup venue,\" US silver medallist Morgan Pearson told reporters.\n\n\"I don't think any of us are like 'I'm not going to race because of the chance of E. coli'. It's the Olympics. But that shows the liberty they took,\" he added.\n\nHeavy rainstorms overwhelm Paris's sewerage system, leading to discharges of untreated waste water that send levels of bacteria such as E.Coli spiking.\n\nParis has been drenched by two major downpours since the Olympics started, on the night of the opening ceremony and again last Thursday evening.\n\nThe Paris 2024 organising committee said in a statement that testing on the day of the men's and women's triathlon last week had shown that the quality of the water was \"very good\" based on World Triathlon's criteria.\n\n\"The decision on whether to proceed with an event is taken by the international federation, World Triathlon, in coordination with Paris 2024, and based on the test results and a range of (notably health) criteria,\" it said.\n\n\"Paris 2024 wishes to remind everyone that the health and wellbeing of athletes is our top priority,\" it added.\n\nadp/gj\n\nMore from this section\n\nHarris has secured enough

Obviously it wasn't the best preparation for today.\"\n\nThe relay is a four-person sprint triathlon, with Monday's race seeing two men and two women completing a 300-metre swim in the Seine, a seven-kilometre (4.3-mile) bike ride through central Paris and a 1.8 km run.\n\nThe Seine has been the focus of attention during the Paris triathlon events with the waterway consistently failing water quality tests despite a 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) upgrade to improve the Paris sewerage and water treatment systems.\n\nThe men's race last week had to be delayed by 24 hours and no training has been possible since the start of the Games on July 28, with many athletes again surprised by the strength of the current on Monday.\n\n\"It takes some courage to swim and the ability of a good swimmer to navigate it,\" victorious German Tim Hellwig told reporters.\n\nOrganisers have stressed that the illnesses cannot be attributed to the Seine and Hellwig said he felt confident in the water tests overseen by international governing body World Triathlon.\n\n\"No-one was afraid to jump in. We were all happy to have a race,\" he added, saying that he woke up fine after last week's men's event.\n\n\"If like 99 percent of the athletes don't have any problems, I think it's fine,\" he said.\n\nMore from this section Harris campaign raises hulking $310 mn in July Colombia, Guatemala learn from each other in rainforest preservation No.1 Swiatek withdraws from WTA Toronto event due to fatigue - Safety -\n\nOn the eve of Monday's relay, the Belgian National Olympic Committee (COIB) revealed that Michel had fallen sick in a statement that also criticised the organisation of the triathlon at the Paris Games.\n\n\"The COIB and Belgian Triathlon hope that the lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympics,\" the committee said.\n\nOther racers have also expressed frustration that decisions on whether the river could be used for the training and competitions were taken in the middle of the night, while organisers had threatened to scrap the swimming leg completely if the river remained too dirty.\n\n\"I don't want to be too negative. However I do think if a situation like this happens again at the Olympics, they should have a backup venue,\" US silver medallist Morgan Pearson told reporters.\n\n\"I don't think any of us are like 'I'm not going to race because of the chance of E. coli'. It's the Olympics. But that shows the liberty they took,\" he added.\n\nHeavy rainstorms overwhelm Paris's sewerage system, leading to discharges of untreated waste water that send levels of bacteria such as E.Coli spiking.\n\nParis has been drenched by two major downpours since the Olympics started, on the night of the opening ceremony and again last Thursday evening.\n\nThe Paris 2024 organising committee said

Here's the latest on water quality concerns", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- At the Paris Olympics, whether the water quality in the Seine River is safe enough to host some swimming events has been a major question.\n\nBacteria levels in the river fluctuate constantly, and daily water samples are tested so organizers can assess the risk and determine whether swims in the long-polluted Paris waterway should go forward.\n\nTriathletes raced in the river Wednesday, and testing will determine whether upcoming competitions will happen as planned, including the triathlon mixed relay Monday and the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nHere are some things to know about water quality testing in the Seine:\n\nWhy do bacteria levels matter?\n\nHigh levels of E. coli and enterococci indicate sewage or fecal pollution in the water. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or intestines can result.\n\nHow susceptible a person is to falling ill from E. coli exposure depends on several factors, chief among them a person's age and general health.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the healthier you are, the more likely you're going to be to withstand any sort of pathogen,\" said Brian Rahm, a biological and environmental engineering expert at Cornell University.\n\nSometimes it's not even the E. coli itself that's cause for worry, Rahm said. \"When we see E. coli in the water, it indicates that other types of pathogens and other bacteria, viruses may also be in the water.\"\n\nTesting helps organizers assess the risk to athletes, but it's difficult to quantify the exact risk using that data, said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is not much to do prior to exposure to reduce the risk,\" Duran said.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who competed in the Seine three days earlier, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to his swim in the river and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes reported stomach problems.\n\nWhy do bacteria levels change?\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is linked closely to the weather. Heavy rains cause wastewater and runoff to flow into the river, causing bacteria levels to rise, while the sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria.\n\nAnd Paris has seen several downpours during the Games so far.\n\nTo deal with those contingencies, Paris made 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements ahead of the Olympics, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said those improvements have made a big difference.\n\n\"We'll never keep rain events from having an impact on the water quality. That's not possible,\" he said. \"What we've done will allow us to return to a water quality that is satisfactory and good, like it was for the triathlon.\"\n\nOrganizers have canceled multiple test swims this weekend and last week meant to let triathletes familiarize themselves with the course over water quality concerns following rain. The men's triathlon was postponed by a day, then went ahead Wednesday, the same day as the women's race.\n\nFor Monday's triathlon mixed relay, if the water quality isn't at safe levels, organizers can delay to Tuesday. If concerns persist, the swim will be scrapped and the athletes will just compete in the running and cycling portions of the race.\n\nDecisions on whether to cancel an event are made in the wee hours of the morning on race day, and that's what is expected to happen for Monday's triathlon mixed relay. Organizers consider samples taken from the river 21 and a half hours earlier to allow time for cultures to develop in a lab.\n\nRabadan said infrastructure improvements prevent wastewater from flowing into the Seine. It rained Wednesday as the triathletes competed. Wastewater entering the river upstream would take several hours to reach Paris, meaning that the water quality levels were still safe at the time of that race, he said.\n\nSince then, there was a heavy downpour Thursday night and it also rained Saturday evening.\n\nParis 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps said Sunday that organizers are \"hopeful that we can organize the competition tomorrow, and we will take the decision, as planned, tomorrow morning.\"\n\nWhat do the tests consider?\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon in an email called the European Union's 2006 directive \"the most complete guidelines for bathing water,\" based on the range of factors it takes into account. Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren't suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.\n\nAre the tests used during the Games sufficient?\n\nDan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, says the tests have \"shortcomings\" and \"undercount severely the bacteria.\"\n\nFluidion is testing the water several times a day, and Angelescu said, \"What we see is that water quality is not as good as those measurement data that the city publishes,\" resulting in \"an underestimation of the actual risk.\"\n\nThe company measures both \"free floating\" bacteria in the water and takes a \"comprehensive\" level that Angelescu says also includes bacteria attached to fecal or sediment particles. He said the comprehensive count provides a more complete picture than the lab test the city is using.\n\nHe likened it to watching a busy road with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars and buses and trying to count all the people. The city's method, he said, is akin to counting from a helicopter and weighting each person or vehicle equally because you can't see how many people are inside each car or bus. He says his comprehensive test is more like a police officer stopping each vehicle and counting each person inside the cars and buses to get a complete count.\n\nAngelescu said he discussed these discrepancies with city officials and that they decided to continue with the standard laboratory method they had been using, which complies with regulations. That was a \"fair decision in view of the regulations,\" he said. \"The problem is the regulations are wrong.\"\n\nRahm of Cornell University said that, ultimately, \"from a public health perspective. it doesn't matter whether it's free flowing or trapped inside a dirt particle. It's going to get inside your body one way or another.\"\n\n___\n\nNaishadham reported from Washington.

River Seine pollution has already led to the cancellation of practice sessions, while there is a possibility the triathlon will be downgraded to a duathlon format. Organizers continue to be criticised for ongoing E. coli issues in the historic but unclean river.\n\nBelgium has pulled out of Monday's in-doubt triathlon at the 2024 Paris Olympics - with a member of their team hospitalised for four days after swimming in the River Seine.\n\nEarly reports from Daily Mail indicate that Claire Michel has been ''hospitalised with an E. coli infection'. The bacteria can lead to various severe stomach and intestinal problems. As such, more criticism towards the Games officials has emerged as serious questions continue to be asked about the suitability of a river that has not been fit for human use for 100 years.\n\nA full Seine cleanup was proposed as part of Paris's bid to hold the Olympics, as a way for the city's leaders to show that holding the games would \"ensure that our candidacy is useful to Parisians.\" But while the work began in 2016, and over \u00a31billion has been spent on the operation so far, there's still issues with its health and safety.\n\nRelated 'I Swam in River Seine at The Olympics - I Saw Things I Don't Want to Think About'\n\nTriathletes were forced to swim in the highly polluted River Seine, which had previously been banned for 100 years\n\n1 Belgium Pull out of Triathlon A practice session was cancelled on Sunday amid pollution fears\n\nA practice session was cancelled on Sunday after rainfall in Paris pushed pollution in the water beyond permitted levels amid fears that the River Seine still doesn't meet health and safety requirements. Organisers were due to make a call on whether the mixed relay would go ahead this morning - just hours before the event was due to start. Tomorrow has been pencilled in as a back-up day.\n\nBut while the men's triathlon, won by Britain's Alex Yee, ended up being pushed back and both the men's and women's familiarisation sessions were postponed earlier in the Games, more embarassment seems to be heaping on top of the organisers, who are yet to admit defeat in their hopes of reliving Olympic heritage by using the historic venue.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: The River Seine in Paris was last used for the Olympics during the 1900 Summer Games. It served as the venue for events such as swimming and rowing. The Seine's waters were utilized for various competitions, with swimmers racing against the backdrop of one of the world's most famous rivers.\n\nLevels of E. coli have regularly been deemed too high for events this Summer, and the latest episode in an embarrassing saga has forced the Belgian Committee to take a stand against the ongoing issue. Michel's fellow Jolien Vermeylen recently slammed organised, saying they don't care for the 'safety of the athletes'.\n\nRelated Olympic Triathlete Vomits After Swimming in River Seine\n\nCanadian triathlete Tyler Mislawchuk was captured immediately throwing up after he crossed the finishing line at the Paris Olympics.\n\n2 Belgium's Statement They hope that lessons will finally be learnt\n\nThe statement released on Sunday read: \"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon unfortunately have to announce that the Belgian Hammers will not start in the Mixed Relay competition at the Paris Games tomorrow. This decision, as well as the communication about it, was taken in consultation with the athletes and the entourage.\n\n\"Claire Michel, one of the athletes in the mixed relay team, unfortunately has to withdraw from the competition due to illness. Claire Michel is a member of both the BOIC and World Triathlon Athlete Commissions. As an athlete representative, she is committed to continuously evaluating and improving conditions for athletes.\n\n\"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions. We are thinking of training days that can be guaranteed, competition days and formats that are clear in advance and circumstances that do not cause uncertainty among athletes, entourage and fans.\"\n\nAround a month before the Games started, tests from a monitoring group showed E. coli, which is linked to faeces and can cause diarrhoea, urinary tract infections, sepsis and pneumonia, was 10 times higher than acceptable levels.

The results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and would be within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning, they said in a statement.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill.

That included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nHeavy rains that have fallen off and on during the Games have caused headaches for organizers as they result in elevated levels of fecal bacteria, including E. coli and enterococci, flowing into the river. Drenching rains fell Thursday night, but conditions had otherwise been dry except for light rain Saturday evening. The sun shone brightly as the race unfolded Monday and athletes said organizers reassured them that there were no concerns with water quality.\n\nOrganizers have continued to express confidence that warm temperatures and the sun's ultraviolet rays would combine to kill enough of the germs ahead of each event set to include a swim in the Seine.\n\nAthletes swam in the river for the men's and women's individual triathlons Wednesday, though the men's race had been delayed by a day because of the water quality. Elevated bacteria levels in the waterway have caused cancellations of the swimming portion of training sessions for the relay event.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay involves four-person teams made up of two men and two women, with each athlete swimming for 300 meters (yards), cycling for 6.8 kilometers (4.2 miles) and running for 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).

Here's the latest on water quality concerns", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- At the Paris Olympics, whether the water quality in the Seine River is safe enough to host some swimming events has been a major question.\n\nBacteria levels in the river fluctuate constantly, and daily water samples are tested so organizers can assess the risk and determine whether swims in the long-polluted Paris waterway should go forward.\n\nTriathletes raced in the river Wednesday, and testing will determine whether upcoming competitions will happen as planned, including the triathlon mixed relay Monday and the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nHere are some things to know about water quality testing in the Seine:\n\nHigh levels of E. coli and enterococci indicate sewage or fecal pollution in the water. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or intestines can result.\n\nHow susceptible a person is to falling ill from E. coli exposure depends on several factors, chief among them a person's age and general health.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the healthier you are, the more likely you're going to be to withstand any sort of pathogen,\" said Brian Rahm, a biological and environmental engineering expert at Cornell University.\n\nSometimes it's not even the E. coli itself that's cause for worry, Rahm said. \"When we see E. coli in the water, it indicates that other types of pathogens and other bacteria, viruses may also be in the water.\"\n\nTesting helps organizers assess the risk to athletes, but it's difficult to quantify the exact risk using that data, said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is not much to do prior to exposure to reduce the risk,\" Duran said.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who competed in the Seine three days earlier, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to his swim in the river and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes reported stomach problems.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is linked closely to the weather. Heavy rains cause wastewater and runoff to flow into the river, causing bacteria levels to rise, while the sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria.\n\nAnd Paris has seen several downpours during the Games so far.\n\nTo deal with those contingencies, Paris made 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements ahead of the Olympics, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said those improvements have made a big difference.\n\n\"We'll never keep rain events from having an impact on the water quality. That's not possible,\" he said. \"What we've done will allow us to return to a water quality that is satisfactory and good, like it was for the triathlon.\"\n\nOrganizers have canceled multiple test swims this weekend and last week meant to let triathletes familiarize themselves with the course over water quality concerns following rain. The men's triathlon was postponed by a day, then went ahead Wednesday, the same day as the women's race.\n\nFor Monday's triathlon mixed relay, if the water quality isn't at safe levels, organizers can delay to Tuesday. If concerns persist, the swim will be scrapped and the athletes will just compete in the running and cycling portions of the race.\n\nDecisions on whether to cancel an event are made in the wee hours of the morning on race day, and that's what is expected to happen for Monday's triathlon mixed relay. Organizers consider samples taken from the river 21 and a half hours earlier to allow time for cultures to develop in a lab.\n\nRabadan said infrastructure improvements prevent wastewater from flowing into the Seine. It rained Wednesday as the triathletes competed. Wastewater entering the river upstream would take several hours to reach Paris, meaning that the water quality levels were still safe at the time of that race, he said.\n\nSince then, there was a heavy downpour Thursday night and it also rained Saturday evening.\n\nParis 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps said Sunday that organizers are \"hopeful that we can organize the competition tomorrow, and we will take the decision, as planned, tomorrow morning.\"\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon in an email called the European Union's 2006 directive \"the most complete guidelines for bathing water,\" based on the range of factors it takes into account. Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren't suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.\n\nDan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, says the tests have \"shortcomings\" and \"undercount severely the bacteria.\"\n\nFluidion is testing the water several times a day, and Angelescu said, \"What we see is that water quality is not as good as those measurement data that the city publishes,\" resulting in \"an underestimation of the actual risk.\"\n\nThe company measures both \"free floating\" bacteria in the water and takes a \"comprehensive\" level that Angelescu says also includes bacteria attached to fecal or sediment particles. He said the comprehensive count provides a more complete picture than the lab test the city is using.\n\nHe likened it to watching a busy road with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars and buses and trying to count all the people. The city's method, he said, is akin to counting from a helicopter and weighting each person or vehicle equally because you can't see how many people are inside each car or bus. He says his comprehensive test is more like a police officer stopping each vehicle and counting each person inside the cars and buses to get a complete count.\n\nAngelescu said he discussed these discrepancies with city officials and that they decided to continue with the standard laboratory method they had been using, which complies with regulations. That was a \"fair decision in view of the regulations,\" he said. \"The problem is the regulations are wrong.\"\n\nRahm of Cornell University said that, ultimately, \"from a public health perspective. it doesn't matter whether it's free flowing or trapped inside a dirt particle. It's going to get inside your body one way or another.\"\n\n___\n\nNaishadham reported from Washington.

Here's the latest on water quality concerns", "body": "Bacteria levels in the river fluctuate constantly, and daily water samples are tested so organizers can assess the risk and determine whether swims in the long-polluted Paris waterway should go forward.\n\nTriathletes raced in the river Wednesday, and testing will determine whether upcoming competitions will happen as planned, including the triathlon mixed relay Monday and the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nHere are some things to know about water quality testing in the Seine:\n\nWhy do bacteria levels matter?\n\nHigh levels of E. coli and enterococci indicate sewage or fecal pollution in the water. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or intestines can result.\n\nHow susceptible a person is to falling ill from E. coli exposure depends on several factors, chief among them a person's age and general health.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the healthier you are, the more likely you're going to be to withstand any sort of pathogen,\" said Brian Rahm, a biological and environmental engineering expert at Cornell University.\n\nSometimes it's not even the E. coli itself that's cause for worry, Rahm said. \"When we see E. coli in the water, it indicates that other types of pathogens and other bacteria, viruses may also be in the water.\"\n\nTesting helps organizers assess the risk to athletes, but it's difficult to quantify the exact risk using that data, said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is not much to do prior to exposure to reduce the risk,\" Duran said.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who competed in the Seine three days earlier, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to his swim in the river and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes reported stomach problems.\n\nWhy do bacteria levels change?\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is linked closely to the weather. Heavy rains cause wastewater and runoff to flow into the river, causing bacteria levels to rise, while the sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria.\n\nAnd Paris has seen several downpours during the Games so far.\n\nTo deal with those contingencies, Paris made 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements ahead of the Olympics, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said those improvements have made a big difference.\n\n\"We'll never keep rain events from having an impact on the water quality. That's not possible,\" he said. \"What we've done will allow us to return to a water quality that is satisfactory and good, like it was for the triathlon.\"\n\nOrganizers have canceled multiple test swims this weekend and last week meant to let triathletes familiarize themselves with the course over water quality concerns following rain. The men's triathlon was postponed by a day, then went ahead Wednesday, the same day as the women's race.\n\nFor Monday's triathlon mixed relay, if the water quality isn't at safe levels, organizers can delay to Tuesday. If concerns persist, the swim will be scrapped and the athletes will just compete in the running and cycling portions of the race.\n\nHow is water quality deemed safe if it rains the day of the race?\n\nDecisions on whether to cancel an event are made in the wee hours of the morning on race day, and that's what is expected to happen for Monday's triathlon mixed relay. Organizers consider samples taken from the river 21 and a half hours earlier to allow time for cultures to develop in a lab.\n\nRabadan said infrastructure improvements prevent wastewater from flowing into the Seine. It rained Wednesday as the triathletes competed. Wastewater entering the river upstream would take several hours to reach Paris, meaning that the water quality levels were still safe at the time of that race, he said.\n\nSince then, there was a heavy downpour Thursday night and it also rained Saturday evening.\n\nParis 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps said Sunday that organizers are \"hopeful that we can organize the competition tomorrow, and we will take the decision, as planned, tomorrow morning.\"\n\nWhat do the tests consider?\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon in an email called the European Union's 2006 directive \"the most complete guidelines for bathing water,\" based on the range of factors it takes into account. Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren't suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.\n\nAre the tests used during the Games sufficient?\n\nDan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, says the tests have \"shortcomings\" and \"undercount severely the bacteria.\"\n\nFluidion is testing the water several times a day, and Angelescu said, \"What we see is that water quality is not as good as those measurement data that the city publishes,\" resulting in \"an underestimation of the actual risk.\"\n\nThe company measures both \"free floating\" bacteria in the water and takes a \"comprehensive\" level that Angelescu says also includes bacteria attached to fecal or sediment particles. He said the comprehensive count provides a more complete picture than the lab test the city is using.\n\nHe likened it to watching a busy road with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars and buses and trying to count all the people. The city's method, he said, is akin to counting from a helicopter and weighting each person or vehicle equally because you can't see how many people are inside each car or bus. He says his comprehensive test is more like a police officer stopping each vehicle and counting each person inside the cars and buses to get a complete count.\n\nAngelescu said he discussed these discrepancies with city officials and that they decided to continue with the standard laboratory method they had been using, which complies with regulations. That was a \"fair decision in view of the regulations,\" he said. \"The problem is the regulations are wrong.\"\n\nRahm of Cornell University said that, ultimately, \"from a public health perspective. it doesn't matter whether it's free flowing or trapped inside a dirt particle. It's going to get inside your body one way or another.\"\n\n___\n\nNaishadham reported from Washington.

Here's the Latest on Water Quality Concerns", "body": "Bacteria levels in the river fluctuate constantly, and daily water samples are tested so organizers can assess the risk and determine whether swims in the long-polluted Paris waterway should go forward.\n\nTriathletes raced in the river Wednesday, and testing will determine whether upcoming competitions will happen as planned, including the triathlon mixed relay Monday and the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nHere are some things to know about water quality testing in the Seine:\n\nWhy do bacteria levels matter?\n\nHigh levels of E. coli and enterococci indicate sewage or fecal pollution in the water. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or intestines can result.\n\nHow susceptible a person is to falling ill from E. coli exposure depends on several factors, chief among them a person's age and general health.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the healthier you are, the more likely you're going to be to withstand any sort of pathogen,\" said Brian Rahm, a biological and environmental engineering expert at Cornell University.\n\nSometimes it's not even the E. coli itself that's cause for worry, Rahm said. \"When we see E. coli in the water, it indicates that other types of pathogens and other bacteria, viruses may also be in the water.\"\n\nTesting helps organizers assess the risk to athletes, but it's difficult to quantify the exact risk using that data, said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is not much to do prior to exposure to reduce the risk,\" Duran said.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who competed in the Seine three days earlier, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to his swim in the river and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes reported stomach problems.\n\nWhy do bacteria levels change?\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is linked closely to the weather. Heavy rains cause wastewater and runoff to flow into the river, causing bacteria levels to rise, while the sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria.\n\nAnd Paris has seen several downpours during the Games so far.\n\nTo deal with those contingencies, Paris made 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements ahead of the Olympics, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said those improvements have made a big difference.\n\n\"We'll never keep rain events from having an impact on the water quality. That's not possible,\" he said. \"What we've done will allow us to return to a water quality that is satisfactory and good, like it was for the triathlon.\"\n\nOrganizers have canceled multiple test swims this weekend and last week meant to let triathletes familiarize themselves with the course over water quality concerns following rain. The men's triathlon was postponed by a day, then went ahead Wednesday, the same day as the women's race.\n\nFor Monday's triathlon mixed relay, if the water quality isn't at safe levels, organizers can delay to Tuesday. If concerns persist, the swim will be scrapped and the athletes will just compete in the running and cycling portions of the race.\n\nDecisions on whether to cancel an event are made in the wee hours of the morning on race day, and that's what is expected to happen for Monday's triathlon mixed relay. Organizers consider samples taken from the river 21 and a half hours earlier to allow time for cultures to develop in a lab.\n\nRabadan said infrastructure improvements prevent wastewater from flowing into the Seine. It rained Wednesday as the triathletes competed. Wastewater entering the river upstream would take several hours to reach Paris, meaning that the water quality levels were still safe at the time of that race, he said.\n\nSince then, there was a heavy downpour Thursday night and it also rained Saturday evening.\n\nParis 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps said Sunday that organizers are \"hopeful that we can organize the competition tomorrow, and we will take the decision, as planned, tomorrow morning.\"\n\nWhat do the tests consider?\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon in an email called the European Union's 2006 directive \"the most complete guidelines for bathing water,\" based on the range of factors it takes into account. Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren't suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.\n\nAre the tests used during the Games sufficient?\n\nDan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, says the tests have \"shortcomings\" and \"undercount severely the bacteria.\"\n\nFluidion is testing the water several times a day, and Angelescu said, \"What we see is that water quality is not as good as those measurement data that the city publishes,\" resulting in \"an underestimation of the actual risk.\"\n\nThe company measures both \"free floating\" bacteria in the water and takes a \"comprehensive\" level that Angelescu says also includes bacteria attached to fecal or sediment particles. He said the comprehensive count provides a more complete picture than the lab test the city is using.\n\nHe likened it to watching a busy road with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars and buses and trying to count all the people. The city's method, he said, is akin to counting from a helicopter and weighting each person or vehicle equally because you can't see how many people are inside each car or bus. He says his comprehensive test is more like a police officer stopping each vehicle and counting each person inside the cars and buses to get a complete count.\n\nAngelescu said he discussed these discrepancies with city officials and that they decided to continue with the standard laboratory method they had been using, which complies with regulations. That was a \"fair decision in view of the regulations,\" he said. \"The problem is the regulations are wrong.\"\n\nRahm of Cornell University said that, ultimately, \"from a public health perspective. it doesn't matter whether it's free flowing or trapped inside a dirt particle. It's going to get inside your body one way or another.\"\n\n___\n\nNaishadham reported from Washington.

The event has been severely hampered by poor water quality levels in the river.\n\nThe men's event was postponed by 24 hours earlier this week due to the water quality, but it ultimately took place after the women's event on Wednesday and was won in dramatic fashion by Team GB's Alex Yee.\n\nHowever, concerns over the water quality have continued to affect the triathlon.

This decision underscores the paramount importance of athlete health and safety in international competitions.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the water quality in the Seine, which has been a topic of discussion leading up to the games. Despite assurances from organizers that water quality tests showed \"very good\" bacteria levels, the unfortunate illness of Michel has prompted a reevaluation of the conditions.\n\nThis is a serious setback for the Belgian Olympic athletes but the health of athletes is always the top priority, and the committee's choice reflects a commitment to this principle.\n\nThe Seine River, which flows through the heart of Paris, has indeed faced significant pollution challenges that have impacted the 2024 Olympic Games. Recent heavy rainfall in Paris led to runoff that compromised the river's water quality, causing delays in the Olympic men's triathlon and concerns over the safety of swimming events. The fluctuating levels of bacteria, such as E. coli and enterococci, are indicators of fecal pollution and have been closely monitored by officials. Despite these setbacks, last-minute water quality tests deemed the river safe for swimming, allowing the triathlon events to proceed with a revised schedule.\n\nThe situation underscores the ongoing struggle to balance environmental health with major international events, highlighting the need for sustainable solutions to urban water pollution. The situation also highlights the challenges faced by host cities in ensuring safe conditions for all participants.\n\nAs we await further updates on Michel's condition and the measures taken by the Paris Olympic organizers, it remains to be seen if this development creates a ripple effect that may cause other withdrawals.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_jackson@lavocedinewyork.com", "name": "Lucas Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface runoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/seine-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Here''s the Latest on Water Quality Concerns | LatestLY", "body": "Get latest articles and stories on Sports at LatestLY. At the Paris Olympics, whether the water quality in the Seine River is safe enough to host some swimming events has been a major question.\n\nParis, Aug 5 (AP) At the Paris Olympics, whether the water quality in the Seine River is safe enough to host some swimming events has been a major question.\n\nBacteria levels in the river fluctuate constantly, and daily water samples are tested so organizers can assess the risk and determine whether swims in the long-polluted Paris waterway should go forward.\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: Noah Lyles Takes Away Gold Medal by Whisker in Men's 100-Meter Final.\n\nTriathletes raced in the river Wednesday, and organizers said Sunday night that Monday's triathlon mixed relay event would be held as planned with the swimming portion in the Seine. Testing will continue ahead of the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nHere are some things to know about water quality testing in the Seine:\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: India To Take On Germany in Semifinals of Men's Hockey.\n\nWhy do bacteria levels matter?\n\nHigh levels of E. coli and enterococci indicate sewage or fecal pollution in the water. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or intestines can result.\n\nHow susceptible a person is to falling ill from E. coli exposure depends on several factors, chief among them a person's age and general health.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the healthier you are, the more likely you're going to be to withstand any sort of pathogen,\" said Brian Rahm, a biological and environmental engineering expert at Cornell University.\n\nSometimes it's not even the E. coli itself that's cause for worry, Rahm said. \"When we see E. coli in the water, it indicates that other types of pathogens and other bacteria, viruses may also be in the water.\"\n\nTesting helps organizers assess the risk to athletes, but it's difficult to quantify the exact risk using that data, said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is not much to do prior to exposure to reduce the risk,\" Duran said.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who competed in the Seine three days earlier, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to his swim in the river and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes reported stomach problems.\n\nWhy do bacteria levels change?\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is linked closely to the weather. Heavy rains cause wastewater and runoff to flow into the river, causing bacteria levels to rise, while the sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria.\n\nAnd Paris has seen several downpours during the Games so far.\n\nTo deal with those contingencies, Paris made 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements ahead of the Olympics, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said those improvements have made a big difference.\n\n\"We'll never keep rain events from having an impact on the water quality. That's not possible,\" he said. \"What we've done will allow us to return to a water quality that is satisfactory and good, like it was for the triathlon.\"\n\nOrganizers have canceled multiple test swims this weekend and last week meant to let triathletes familiarize themselves with the course over water quality concerns following rain. The men's triathlon was postponed by a day, then went ahead Wednesday, the same day as the women's race.\n\nHow is water quality deemed safe if it rains the day of the race?\n\nDecisions on whether to cancel an event had generally been made in the wee hours of the morning on race day, but organizers on Sunday night announced their decision to go forward with Monday's race to give athletes more time to prepare.\n\nRabadan said infrastructure improvements prevent wastewater from flowing into the Seine. It rained Wednesday as the triathletes competed. Wastewater entering the river upstream would take several hours to reach Paris, meaning that the water quality levels were still safe at the time of that race, he said.\n\nSince then, there was a heavy downpour Thursday night and it also rained Saturday evening.\n\nOrganizers have said they consider samples taken from the river 21 and a half hours earlier to allow time for cultures to develop in a lab.\n\nWhat do the tests consider?\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon in an email called the European Union's 2006 directive \"the most complete guidelines for bathing water,\" based on the range of factors it takes into account. Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren't suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.

Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren't suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.\n\nDan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, says the tests have \"shortcomings\" and \"undercount severely the bacteria.\"\n\nFluidion is testing the water several times a day, and Angelescu said, \"What we see is that water quality is not as good as those measurement data that the city publishes,\" resulting in \"an underestimation of the actual risk.\"\n\nThe company measures both \"free floating\" bacteria in the water and takes a \"comprehensive\" level that Angelescu says also includes bacteria attached to fecal or sediment particles. He said the comprehensive count provides a more complete picture than the lab test the city is using.\n\nHe likened it to watching a busy road with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars and buses and trying to count all the people. The city's method, he said, is akin to counting from a helicopter and weighting each person or vehicle equally because you can't see how many people are inside each car or bus. He says his comprehensive test is more like a police officer stopping each vehicle and counting each person inside the cars and buses to get a complete count.\n\nAngelescu said he discussed these discrepancies with city officials and that they decided to continue with the standard laboratory method they had been using, which complies with regulations. That was a \"fair decision in view of the regulations,\" he said. \"The problem is the regulations are wrong.\"\n\nRahm of Cornell University said that, ultimately, \"from a public health perspective. it doesn't matter whether it's free flowing or trapped inside a dirt particle. It's going to get inside your body one way or another.\"\n\n___\n\nNaishadham reported from Washington.

Michel was one of 55 women to dive in the Seine River for the women's triathlon this past Wednesday. She finished 38th overall.\n\nTeam Belgium released a statement saying:\n\n\"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon unfortunately have to announce that the Belgian Hammers will not start in the Mixed Relay competition at the Paris Games tomorrow.

In addition, the men's race, originally scheduled for Tuesday, was pushed back to the same day as the women's events due to poor water quality caused by bacteria such as E. Coli. E. Coli levels have been high in the Seine River, including 10x too high just over a month before the Olympics began.\n\nThe open water swimming events are also scheduled to take place in the Seine later this week with the women's 10km race scheduled for Thursday and the men's 10km race on Friday.

This situation and the suspension of training for the in-water portion of the triathlon casts doubt on the mixed relay event scheduled for Monday. It is not the only event pending on the river: the men's and women's marathon swims are scheduled for 8 and 9 August.\n\nTraining in the river was interrupted last week, and the men's individual event was postponed due to pollution problems. Many triathletes were caught by surprise by the strong currents in the Seine, with some expressing concerns about water quality and delays affecting their training and the men's competition.\n\nIn this case, Thursday night's heavy storm is suspected to have worsened the water quality of the river, as downpours often cause sewage overflows in the Seine.\n\nHowever, on Saturday night Paris 2024 spokeswoman Anne Descamps said Sunday's training sessions had also been cancelled, due to the rain in recent days and linking Monday's event to confidence in improved weather forecasts.\n\nParis had set out to make the most of its identity for the Games, presenting itself to the world as a city full of monuments and recognisable symbols. The opening ceremony turned the city into a stage, especially the River Seine, along which the national delegations paraded in boats.\n\nIt was also announced that sporting events would be held on the iconic river, raising doubts from citizens and environmental groups about its quality. Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera and Mayor Anne Hidalgo bathed in the river as a way of sending a message about its good condition.\n\nFrench authorities have invested 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) over the past decade to clean up the Seine. Paris organisers said the water quality was \"very good\" according to criteria used by the World Triathlon. Levels of E. coli bacteria, a key indicator of faecal contamination, were recorded at 192-308 colony-forming units per 100 millilitres (cfu/ml) on race day, well below the maximum limit of 1,000 cfu/ml.\n\nNevertheless, heavy rainfall can overwhelm the city's underground drains and sewage system, causing untreated effluent to be discharged into the river. It has not helped that the weather has also been erratic, ranging from heat waves to torrential rain.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karate@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Karate", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "oscar_allende@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Oscar Allende", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_1972_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_individual", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's individual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony-forming_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colony-forming unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effluent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Effluent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/301398/o/Athletes+get+ready+to+compete+in+the+swimming+race+in+the+Seine+during+the+women%27s+individual+triathlon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "dateEnd": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1118, "textEnd": 1132}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Is Disgusting Seine To Blame?", "body": "If there's one thing I've learned from the Summer Olympics, it's that I'm never going to swim in the Seine River.\n\nCalling the water quality of this river \"nasty\" is an insult to the word nasty. The French spent $1.5 billion trying to make this water somewhat swimable, and it still didn't do anything. In fact, the start of the triathlon events at these Olympic Games had to be delayed because of dangerous levels of E. Coli.\n\nThe Seine makes Boston's rivers - forever immortalized in a song literally called \"Dirty Water\" - look sparkling clean.\n\nSo yeah, the river sucks, plain and simple. In fact, one Canadian triathlete puked his guts out Wednesday after emerging from the Seine.\n\nWe're not entirely sure if the puking was caused by swimming in the Seine, but it's nonetheless a bad look. And this is not the only athlete who has had post-Seine health problems.\n\nThe Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee announced Sunday afternoon that it will have to withdraw its mixed relay triathlon team after Claire Michel fell sick. Michel had competed in the women's triathlon Wednesday, and just a few days after swimming in the Seine (that would be a great music album name, wouldn't it?), she's not feeling so great.\n\nAgain, there have been other athletes who swam in the Seine and fell ill after, but couldn't confidently blame their sickness on the water conditions. Even so, this is getting suspicious.\n\nI get that these men and women have to do this in order to potentially win a medal at the Olympics. But if this river can't be made clean enough after spending over a billion dollars on restoring it, no one should ever set foot in that river again.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_simmons@outkick.com", "name": "John Simmons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/08/seine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Here's the latest on water quality concerns", "body": "By Kate Brumback and Suman Naishadham, The Associated Press\n\nPARIS -- At the Paris Olympics, whether the water quality in the Seine River is safe enough to host some swimming events has been a major question.\n\nBacteria levels in the river fluctuate constantly, and daily water samples are tested so organizers can assess the risk and determine whether swims in the long-polluted Paris waterway should go forward.\n\nTriathletes raced in the river Wednesday, and organizers said Sunday night that Monday's triathlon mixed relay event would be held as planned with the swimming portion in the Seine. Testing will continue ahead of the marathon swimming races scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nHere are some things to know about water quality testing in the Seine:\n\nHigh levels of E. coli and enterococci indicate sewage or fecal pollution in the water. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or intestines can result.\n\nHow susceptible a person is to falling ill from E. coli exposure depends on several factors, chief among them a person's age and general health.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the healthier you are, the more likely you're going to be to withstand any sort of pathogen,\" said Brian Rahm, a biological and environmental engineering expert at Cornell University.\n\nSometimes it's not even the E. coli itself that's cause for worry, Rahm said. \"When we see E. coli in the water, it indicates that other types of pathogens and other bacteria, viruses may also be in the water.\"\n\nTesting helps organizers assess the risk to athletes, but it's difficult to quantify the exact risk using that data, said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is not much to do prior to exposure to reduce the risk,\" Duran said.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who competed in the Seine three days earlier, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to his swim in the river and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes reported stomach problems.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is linked closely to the weather. Heavy rains cause wastewater and runoff to flow into the river, causing bacteria levels to rise, while the sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria.\n\nAnd Paris has seen several downpours during the Games so far.\n\nTo deal with those contingencies, Paris made 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements ahead of the Olympics, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said those improvements have made a big difference.\n\n\"We'll never keep rain events from having an impact on the water quality. That's not possible,\" he said. \"What we've done will allow us to return to a water quality that is satisfactory and good, like it was for the triathlon.\"\n\nOrganizers have canceled multiple test swims this weekend and last week meant to let triathletes familiarize themselves with the course over water quality concerns following rain. The men's triathlon was postponed by a day, then went ahead Wednesday, the same day as the women's race.\n\nDecisions on whether to cancel an event had generally been made in the wee hours of the morning on race day, but organizers on Sunday night announced their decision to go forward with Monday's race to give athletes more time to prepare.\n\nRabadan said infrastructure improvements prevent wastewater from flowing into the Seine. It rained Wednesday as the triathletes competed. Wastewater entering the river upstream would take several hours to reach Paris, meaning that the water quality levels were still safe at the time of that race, he said.\n\nSince then, there was a heavy downpour Thursday night and it also rained Saturday evening.\n\nOrganizers have said they consider samples taken from the river 21 and a half hours earlier to allow time for cultures to develop in a lab.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon in an email called the European Union's 2006 directive \"the most complete guidelines for bathing water,\" based on the range of factors it takes into account. Other organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, set a limit of 126 units per 100 milliliters of water and say that higher levels aren't suitable for recreational use.\n\nIn deciding whether events can be held in the river, World Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast.\n\nA day after Wednesday's competitions in the Seine, data released by World Triathlon showed that a sample taken at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Pont Alexandre III, the bridge where the swimming segment began and ended, showed a level of 249 units. Samples from other points along the course were at similar levels.\n\nDan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, says the tests have \"shortcomings\" and \"undercount severely the bacteria.\"\n\nFluidion is testing the water several times a day, and Angelescu said, \"What we see is that water quality is not as good as those measurement data that the city publishes,\" resulting in \"an underestimation of the actual risk.\"\n\nThe company measures both \"free floating\" bacteria in the water and takes a \"comprehensive\" level that Angelescu says also includes bacteria attached to fecal or sediment particles. He said the comprehensive count provides a more complete picture than the lab test the city is using.\n\nHe likened it to watching a busy road with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars and buses and trying to count all the people. The city's method, he said, is akin to counting from a helicopter and weighting each person or vehicle equally because you can't see how many people are inside each car or bus. He says his comprehensive test is more like a police officer stopping each vehicle and counting each person inside the cars and buses to get a complete count.\n\nAngelescu said he discussed these discrepancies with city officials and that they decided to continue with the standard laboratory method they had been using, which complies with regulations. That was a \"fair decision in view of the regulations,\" he said. \"The problem is the regulations are wrong.\"\n\nRahm of Cornell University said that, ultimately, \"from a public health perspective. it doesn't matter whether it's free flowing or trapped inside a dirt particle. It's going to get inside your body one way or another.\"", "source": {"uri": "pennlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pennlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enterococcus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villanova University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.pennlive.com/resizer/v2/JHX2HLBIJVAUFPUCYTZ2AOBZUY.jpg?auth=23df91ccfa33b8d8de82ee6d1522ccd494860f74f2744eb560b1f392f11f9d80&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The committee, however, did not share additional details about Michel's health.\n\nThe committee said in the statement that they, along with Belgian Triathlon, hope the lessons learned from the situation will aid in improving future competitions.\n\nMichel, 35, previously competed in the women's triathlon event July 30 and finished 38th. She was expected to compete with teammates Jolien Vermeylen, Marten Van Riel and Jelle Geens, the self-titled Belgium Hammers, in the upcoming relay. The official Olympics website had included Belgium as one of the teams who could take home a medal in the event.\n\nThe news of Michel's withdrawal comes after the Associated Press reported Aug. 3 that Swiss athlete Adrien Briffod would no longer compete in the mixed relay event due to a stomach infection.\n\nBriffod had participated in the men's triathlon a few days earlier on July 31 and finished 49th. For the women's and men's triathlon events, the athletes swam in the Seine River, despite initial concerns about the high levels of bacteria in the water.\n\nThe Paris 2024 organizing committee and World Triathlon released a joint statement hours prior to the start of the races that said the water quality was \"compliant\" for swimming.\n\nThe Switzerland Olympic team said in a statement that it was \"impossible to say\" if swimming in the Seine caused Brifford's gastrointestinal infection, AP reported.\n\nRead on to see what Belgium had to say about the source of Michel's illness.\n\nFollowing news that Belgium would not participate in the mixed relay triathlon, some outlets reported that Michel had been hospitalized for days. But in a statement sent to TODAY.com, Team Belgium confirmed that was \"incorrect.\"\n\n\"We have seen various statements in national and international media with incorrect information.

Both the men's and women's races eventually got underway on Wednesday, but the fallout has continued ahead of the mixed relay.\n\nOver the weekend, Switzerland had to mix up its roster and Belgium withdrew from the race on Sunday after athletes from both countries fell ill following the initial triathlon races last week.\n\nBelgium announced it was dropping out of the race after Claire Michel had fallen ill but did not specify her illness, which was reported days after she swam in the river during the women's triathlon.\n\nThe Swiss team, meanwhile, had to replace Adrien Briffod, who had to withdraw due to a gastrointestinal infection. Swiss Olympic Chief Medical Officer Hanspeter Betschart noted that it is unclear if Briffod's infection is related to the Seine's water quality.\n\nParis 2024 organizers have defended their decision to go ahead with the races and said the water quality was \"very good\" ahead of last week's individual triathlon races.\n\nOngoing saga\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the River Seine raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the famous river has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up pollution.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) had been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nCNN reporter goes swimming in the Seine after $1.5B cleanup. See how it went\n\n01:23 - Source: CNN\n\nRegardless, Australia's team doctor told reporters Monday that the nation's triathletes were administered medication against E. coli bacteria a month ago.\n\n\"We've been following the figures for a long time. So we assume that when it's declared safe, that it is safe, but we're also taking extra measures. And so we started by administering a medication that's good against E. coli, which is the main bacteria in this water a month ago,\" Carolyn Broderick told reporters on Monday.\n\nAmid all the controversy, it turned out to be a brilliant race, with Germany's Laura Lindemann helping overcome a 12-second deficit to earn her country the win.\n\nAfter a post-race review, Team USA was awarded a silver medal and Great Britain, bidding to defend its title won in Tokyo, picked up the bronze in a nail-biting photo finish.\n\nThe distances for the mixed relay are shorter than in individual races.\n\nTriathletes dive into the River Seine during the mixed relay race.\n\nPiroschka Van De Wouw/Reuters\n\nLed by men's gold medalist Alex Yee, Team GB had looked to be in pole position, but a strong final leg from Germany's Lindemann and USA's Taylor Knibb made it a three-horse race.\n\nThe three were involved in a frantic sprint finish, with Lindemann just getting ahead to win Germany's first triathlon medal in any discipline since 2008. All three women fell to the floor out of exhaustion after crossing the line.\n\nThe medalists were helped by an early crash that impacted hosts France and medal contenders New Zealand.\n\nMen's silver medalist Hayden Wilde and French athlete Pierre Le Corre collided during the cycling segment of the first leg and dashed their respective country's chances of finishing on the podium.

The Swiss athlete Adrien Briffod also suffered a gastrointestinal infection, although his national body maintains it is \"impossible to say\" if it is linked to water quality in the Seine. Team GB, Telegraph Sport understands, are fully fit, with no athletes experiencing any ill effects.\n\nSeveral outbreaks of rain, including a thunderstorm on Thursday, had already prompted some anxiety for organisers over the weekend. Independent analysis suggested E.coli readings on the Seine were high again but Paris 2024 spokeswoman Anne Descamps said improvement was expected ahead of early hours tests on Monday.\n\nOrganisers have the option of moving the scheduled race to Tuesday if levels prove too big. On Saturday morning, Thomas Bach, the IOC president, had boasted that the event on the river was \"Seinesational\".\n\nDescamps, however, could say only that she was \"hopeful\" of the event going ahead on Monday. \"We took the decision to cancel the swim familiarisation for the mixed triathlon,\" she explained. \"We shared the information last night in order to avoid late communication to the athletes. It followed the rain that occurred in the last days.\n\n\"We are expecting improvement in the next hours. I don't have the last figures but we are expecting improvements regarding the weather forecasts. We are hopeful we can organise the competition tomorrow and we will take the decision as planned tomorrow morning regarding the last samples.\"\n\nFlemish media revealed how Michel was in hospital, with the national governing body saying only that the triathlete is \"sick\". No link has yet been established between the infection suffered and the 1500m she swam in the Seine.\n\nIn a statement, the Belgian Olympic Committee announced the decision not to participate was taken \"in consultation with the athletes and the entourage\".\n\n\"The BOIC and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions,\" a statement said. \"We are thinking of training days that can be guaranteed, competition days and formats that are clear in advance and circumstances that do not lead to uncertainty among athletes, entourage and fans.\"\n\nGreat Britain's Alex Yee and Beth Potter have been fine since taking gold and bronze respectively in the individual events. The men's race had been postponed by 24 hours.\n\nThe open water marathon swims are scheduled for Aug. 9.

It also comes as a report surfaced in Belgian media claiming Michel is hospitalized with an E. coli infection.\n\nMichel competed in Wednesday's women's triathlon.\n\nUSA TODAY could not confirm the report about Michel's alleged hospitalization or the E. coli infection. It appeared in Belgian newspaper De Standaard. The Belgian Olympic Committee would not comment directly on the claims. World Triathlon, the sport's international body, said it was not aware of the report. Nor was the International Olympic Committee, according to spokesman Mark Adams, which said it was looking into the report.\n\nThe Belgian Olympic Committee and Belgian Triathlon, the nation's domestic governing body, said they hope \"to learn lessons for future triathlon competitions. These include training days that can be guaranteed, race days and formats that are clear in advance and conditions that do not create uncertainty for athletes, entourage and fans.\"\n\nThe water-quality tests monitor the Seine river's E. coli levels. Those levels have fluctuated during the Paris Olympics - increasing after days of rainfall, then falling back during drier spells. E. coli bacteria can cause stomach and intestinal problems that can be short-lived, or longer-term more serious and debilitating infections.\n\nConcerns about the Seine river's cleanliness have dogged Olympic organizers. Despite much public skepticism they have sought to portray a swimmable Seine as one of the Paris Games' potential defining legacies.

Both the men's and women's races eventually got underway on Wednesday, but the fallout has continued ahead of the mixed relay.\n\nOver the weekend, Switzerland had to mix up its roster and Belgium withdrew from the race on Sunday after athletes from both countries fell ill following the initial triathlon races last week.\n\nBelgium announced it was dropping out of the race after Claire Michel had fallen ill but did not specify her illness, which was reported days after she swam in the river during the women's triathlon.\n\nThe Swiss team, meanwhile, had to replace Adrien Briffod, who had to withdraw due to a gastrointestinal infection. Swiss Olympic Chief Medical Officer Hanspeter Betschart noted that it is unclear if Briffod's infection is related to the Seine's water quality.\n\nParis 2024 organizers have defended their decision to go ahead with the races and said the water quality was \"very good\" ahead of last week's individual triathlon races.\n\nOngoing saga\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the River Seine raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the famous river has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up pollution.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) had been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability.\n\nRegardless, Australia's team doctor told reporters Monday that the nation's triathletes were administered medication against E. coli bacteria a month ago.\n\n\"We've been following the figures for a long time. So we assume that when it's declared safe, that it is safe, but we're also taking extra measures. And so we started by administering a medication that's good against E. coli, which is the main bacteria in this water a month ago,\" Carolyn Broderick told reporters on Monday.\n\nAmid all the controversy, it turned out to be a brilliant race, with Germany's Laura Lindemann helping overcome a 12-second deficit to earn her country the win.\n\nAfter a post-race review, Team USA was awarded a silver medal and Great Britain, bidding to defend its title won in Tokyo, picked up the bronze in a nail-biting photo finish.\n\nThe distances for the mixed relay are shorter than in individual races.\n\nLed by men's gold medalist Alex Yee, Team GB had looked to be in pole position, but a strong final leg from Germany's Lindemann and USA's Taylor Knibb made it a three-horse race.\n\nThe three were involved in a frantic sprint finish, with Lindemann just getting ahead to win Germany's first triathlon medal in any discipline since 2008. All three women fell to the floor out of exhaustion after crossing the line.\n\nThe medalists were helped by an early crash that impacted hosts France and medal contenders New Zealand.\n\nMen's silver medalist Hayden Wilde and French athlete Pierre Le Corre collided during the cycling segment of the first leg and dashed their respective country's chances of finishing on the podium.

The Seine played host the 1.5km swimming leg for those two events, with the mixed relay seeing all four athletes on each team swim a 300m leg.\n\nBut there are renewed doubts over whether the event will be able to go ahead as planned. Organisers were forced to cancel the planned training session on Saturday morning, having been forced to twice call off earlier swimming familiarisation events.\n\nHeavy rain in recent days forced the cancellation, though the bike and run sessions took place as planned. Organisers insisted they had taken quick action following criticism over their decision to postpone the men's event just three hours before it was due to start.\n\n\"At the daily meeting to review water quality that took place today (Friday) at 19:30 ... decision has been made to cancel the swim leg of the triathlon familiarisation which was due to be held on August 3rd at 8:00,\" a statement read.\n\n\"Given the heavy rain over the last two nights, which have been particularly intense upstream of the Paris, and the expected drop in water quality as a result, it has been decided, in anticipation, to cancel the familiarisation swim on Saturday, August 3rd.\n\n\"In view that the conditions will likely not improve before the daily situation meeting scheduled for Saturday, August 3rd at 4:00, we have decided to cancel the swim familiarisation tonight to avoid late communication to athletes. More updates on the water quality will be provided on August 3rd.\"\n\nThe postponement comes after women's triathlete Jolien Vermeylen blasted the state of the Seine for her race. Cassandre Beaugrand won a home gold for France in the event, but Vermeylen blasted the claims that the river was safe to swim in as being 'bull****'.\n\n\"I drank a lot of water, so we'll know tomorrow if I'm sick or not ,\" she told VTM. \"It doesn't taste like Coca-Cola or Sprite, obviously. While swimming under the bridge, I smelled and saw things that we shouldn't think about too much.\n\n\"The Seine has been dirty for a hundred years, so they can't say that the safety of athletes is a priority. That's bull****. If the race had not taken place, it would have been a disgrace for the organisation, for Paris, for France. It was now or never, and they couldn't cancel the race completely either.\"\n\nOrganisers have revealed that the Seine was assessed to have had 'very good' quality for the women's and men's events. The bacteria rate was \"between 192 and 308\" CFU/ml, well below the regulatory threshold set by the sports federations at 1,000 CFU/ml.\n\nWhile those results saw the Seine declared safe, not everyone believes the event should be held in the Seine. Spanish triathlete Miriam Casillas Garcia said: \"They thought more about the stage, the image, making it beautiful and selling it in the Seine.\n\n\"If we had thought about the health of the athletes, it would not have been done here and there would have been a real plan B. They had eight years to prepare the Games. We are a bit like the clowns in the circus, they put us there and we have to go through that. It's a bit of a shame.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Even Joan of Arc's ashes were reportedly deposited there after she was burned at the stake in 1431.\n\nSo it should be no surprise that the river, which cuts through the center of Paris, is no longer pristine. But concerns about the water quality, which forced the men's triathlon to be postponed a day, have lifted and now there's a new worry ahead of Monday's triathlon mixed relay and Thursday and Friday's marathon swim events.\n\nThe currents.\n\n\"I got scared quite a few times because the current carried us away a lot. It wasn't so easy to swim in the Seine,\" Cassandre Beaugrand of France, winner of the women's triathlon, said of the currents, which were nearly three times as strong as normal.\n\n\"The current was a lot stronger,\" agreed New Zealand's Hayden Wilde, the silver medalist in the men's race. \"It was technically the hardest swim we've ever done. Obviously you can see we were in there for a few extra minutes, so that was really tough.\"\n\nIn the triathlon, the athletes swam just a mile in the river. The marathon swimmers will go more than six times as far, making both the currents and the bacteria levels in the water even bigger factors.\n\nThe Olympics have been here before, of course. Eight years ago in Rio de Janeiro, the open-water swimming events were held in Copacabana, near where a mutilated body washed up five weeks earlier. And that wasn't the only thing in the water. With tons of trash and raw sewage from the city's poor neighborhoods flowing directly into the bay, the waters were found to be up to 1.7 million times more dangerous than a U.S. beach.\n\nIn Paris, the Seine has played a major part in the city's history and culture for centuries. Monet, Renoir, Seurat and other Impressionist and post-Impressionists of the 19th century all painted scenes depicting life along the river, although swimming in the Seine was banned a century ago and by the 1960s, the river was declared biologically dead.\n\nSo after being awarded the Olympics in 2017, the municipal government in Paris spent $1.5 billion to upgrade the ancient storm and wastewater infrastructure in the hopes and making the river safe again. And to prove it worked, Anne Hidalgo, the city's mayor, took a dip in the river nine days before the opening ceremony.\n\nThen the unseasonable summer rains came, pounding Paris and undoing much of that work. As in many European cities, the sewer system in the French capital captures both stormwater and wastewater, then routes it through treatment plants. Heavy rains can overwhelm that system, and when the sewer pipes reach capacity, the wastewater has nowhere to go but the river.\n\nAnd it's not just the rain that is the problem on stormy days. The clouds that come along with it block out the sun, preventing it from killing the harmful bacteria in the water.\n\nAfter a one-day delay and much hand-wringing, the Seine was finally declared safe enough for the triathlon and the men's and women's competitions started less than three hours apart, with the water quality and the strong currents attracting much of the attention.\n\n\"The strong current on the way back, that made it harder,\" said Swizterland's Julie Derron, the silver medalist in the women's triathlon. \"But other than that, it's just normal water.\"\n\nAdded Great Britain's Alex Yee, the men's champion: \"I don't feel ill at all. And I'm pretty confident that we'll get a mixed relay ahead. They've done everything they could.\"\n\nBut for South African triathlete Henri Schoeman, who paddled through the dirty water in Brazil to win a bronze medal in 2016, all the focus on the water in Paris was little more than an unwelcome distraction.\n\n\"All the talk was about the river, it wasn't really about the athletes,\" he told reporters. \"It is a bit of a shame that there was a shadow on this whole river story. It is what it is. It's part of the game and you have to adapt to it.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Midi Libre - Michael Esdourrubailh\n\nSports Minister Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Castera denounced the \"false information\" surrounding the withdrawal of Belgian triathlete Claire Michel.\n\nA pure and simple denial. Sports Minister Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Castera spoke on RMC Sport on Monday, August 5, after Belgian triathlete Claire Michel withdrew from the mixed relay, having fallen ill a few days after participating in the women's triathlon.\n\n\"There have been rumors about this Belgian athlete but in fact she has never been hospitalized\", she declared. \"This is false information. She was ill but without a link necessarily being established with her swimming. It will be important for the Belgian NOC to be able to clarify all this. Especially since that day, the quality of the water was particularly good\", she continued. \"This Belgian athlete was ill, she went to the polyclinic. There were no other cases, the athletes are in good health.\"\n\nBelgium had to withdraw from the mixed triathlon relay this Monday. The reason: a possible hospitalization of Claire Michel.

Get after it with local recommendations just for you. Discover nearby events, routes out your door, and hidden gems when you sign up for the Local Running Drop.\n\nThe triathlon mixed team relay was one of the surprise hits of the 2021 Tokyo Games. Not to triathlon's governing body - who had such faith in its value they lobbied tirelessly for years for the inclusion of triathlon mixed relay at the Olympics - but to beguiled sports fans who had witnessed its charms for the first time.\n\nIn those pandemic-era Games, the race could only be seen by most through a television screen; a sanitized version of an enthralling spectacle whose twists and turns throughout the physical course were mirrored by the race dynamics itself. This time, for those lucky enough to soak up the atmosphere, Paris's copious metal fencing represented the only divide.\n\nWhat was to come? That was anyone's guess. The only certainty of triathlon events at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games has been uncertainty. Expectations have changed from the usual pre-race musing over what conditions we might wake up to - at these Games, we weren't sure if there would even be a race.\n\nThe past week, in particular, has been genuine touch-and-go as to whether the water quality or the current will allow a race to proceed at all. First, the pre-race practice swims were cancelled due to poor water quality, then just hours before the men's individual triathlon was slated to go off, the race was postponed a day for the same reason. Paris will forever be remembered as the Games where mental as much as physical resilience was required - perhaps too much so.\n\nAt a request of the athletes, the decision on the mixed relay was made the evening before, rather than 4 a.m., to help preparation. In a memo sent to national federations, World Triathlon stated it \"took the decision to move ahead with the Mixed Relay competition,\" saying that \"Seine water quality levels at the triathlon venue have improved in recent hours, with forward looking [sic] analysis indicating that water quality will be within the levels acceptable by World Triathlon.\"\n\nThere had been few reports of sickness following the individual races, with the only athletes reporting problems being the ones too ill to start the mixed relay event. The first misfortune fell to Belgium's Claire Michel, a bacterial infection cited as the reason for her withdrawal, and with no reserve woman named for the quartet, the self-styled Belgian Hammers pulled out on the eve of the competition, leaving 15 teams remaining.\n\nIn a bizarre merry-go-round, Switzerland's Adrien Briffod was also said to have GI issues and replaced by Simon Westermann, who didn't compete in the individual race and hadn't come into contact with the waters of the Seine. But then Westermann fell sick himself, with Syvain Friedlance called up as a replacement. Oddly, Briffod then took to social media, posting on Instagram stories, \"Big joke. I am ready, back on my feet since yesterday morning AND in Paris.\" Still, he remained off the Swiss roster for the race.\n\nOther teams, perhaps wisely, kept their cards close to their chests. If there was sickness or drama behind the scenes, no sign of weakness would be shown before the event. Few needed the further distraction the inevitable inquisition would bring.\n\nAfter Wednesday's bumper double-header of the women's and men's individual triathlon races, expectations were sky-high for another thrilling contest - most of all for the French team. No triathlete in the quartet of Le Corre, Lombardi, Begere and Beaugrand had finished lower than fourth in the individual races, and they had the newly-crowned Olympic champion on the anchor.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was Team Great Britain, the Tokyo gold medalists with returning players Alex Yee, fresh off a gold-medal surge in the men's individual race at the Paris Games. He was joined by Beth Potter, who took bronze in the individual women's race, as well as Georgia Taylor-Brown, who raced with Yee for Gold in Tokyo, and Sam Dickinson, who played an important role in Yee's gold-medal win just days before.\n\nTeam USA were experiencing a far more sobering Olympic experience. The team's decision was to start with Seth Rider and Taylor Spivey - all-rounders to keep the team in contention - before playing the ace hands of Morgan Pearson's run leg and Taylor Knibb's bike power as the race splintered later.\n\nThe Germans lined up on the pontoon as the Paris test event winners (albeit when it was reduced to a duathlon) and world champions from Hamburg in July. Like the Americans, the individual races hadn't gone the way they wanted, either. Hopes had been particularly high for the German women, but both Lindemann and Tertsch - who'd finished second in the two most recent World Series races - lost time after crashing on the bike leg and finished eighth and ninth respectively. Could the triathlon mixed relay bring redemption?\n\nAs soon as the draw was finalized for spots on the starting pontoon, the matchup of Yee versus Wilde proved to be most enticing leg one showdown.The tactic of fielding the strongest male athlete first was common one, with the underlying wisdom that while you can't win the race on the first leg - there's the potential to be isolated - and lose it.\n\nThe format was a 300-meter swim, followed by 36 steps up to transition on the Pont Alexandre III bridge, a two-lap 7km bike course on the Champs-Elysees and Saint Germain Boulevard, and a 1.8km two-loop run. Then it was tag your teammate, and go again.\n\nAs with the women's individual triathlon race, there was hesitation again over the starting horn; Portugal's Ricardo Batista was issued a ten-second penalty. But the action was happening, and within a few seconds athletes were already at the first buoy as they swept downstream.\n\nThe challenge on the return was whether to cut the corner for a straighter line to the swim exit, or head towards the bank, where the flow was weaker. Spain's Alberto Gonzalez Garcia made the best choice - gambling the current had died down from the individual races - and gained five seconds on on the field, with Miguel Hidalgo (BRA), Tim Hellwig (DEU), and Rider hot on his heels.\n\nGonzalez Garcia had the road to himself until he swept around over Pont des Invalides on the first lap and was swept up by the large chase pack that contained the bulk of the field, with Batista battling hard to regain touch, and Wilde - after giving up time in the swim - dragging the remaining stragglers into the group.\n\nDrama struck for the French on the final U-turn before transition, where Le Corre came together with Wilde, whose wheel slipped out, and lost vital seconds trying to replace his chain. Was this the opportunity the other nations needed to distance the French?\n\nOn the run, Yee, Hellwig and Studer opened a gap as the field started to split, Yee picking up the pace as he hurtled down the ramp to tag Taylor-Brown in the lead with a total split of 20:03.\n\nBehind them, Hellwig tagged in Tertsch three seconds behind, followed by the handoff to Julie Derron (SUI) five seconds down from the front. Italy's Gianluca Pozzatti surged to tag in Alice Betto in fourth place, followed by Norway and Australia.\n\nWhen Rider reached Spivey, Team USA was in tenth place; meanwhile, Le Corre had lost 40 seconds meaning Lombardi and Team France would start the second leg dead last.\n\nTertsch (DEU) took the smartest line around the buoys to close the gap upfront, with Betto (ITA) moving into third. Tthe USA's Spivey brought a superb swim to move into sixth place. Lombardi had picked off the Kiwis and Austrians to move the French back up in the field, but the home nation still had a huge amount of work to get back into contention. At first, it looked like she would have Van Coevorden to work with, but the Aussie took a tumble coming out of transition as she tried to mount her bike.\n\nBut it was Taylor-Brown (GBR) who surged to the front on the bike, the Brit taking the opportunity to prove a point after placing sixth in the women's individual triathlon race. She was clearly enjoying her solo time trial out front, using the u-turns to check her gap back to the chasing pair of Betto and Tertsch that would soon be swallowed up by the pack, driven by Derron (SUI) pulling Australia, Portugal, Spain, and the USA.\n\nIt was turning into a nightmare for the French, as Lombardi found herself isolated on the bike, struggling to bridge a gap of almost 40 seconds to the pack ahead.\n\nUnlike the men's first leg, all the women managed to stay upright as Taylor-Brown started the run with a 10-second buffer on the chasers, led by Derron and Spivey. Lombardi had a rousing reception as she came into transition, but by then the gap had grown to almost a minute and it was looking increasingly difficult for France to get back into the race.\n\nTaylor-Brown lapped Austria's Julia Hauser as she headed for the second changeover, but couldn't hold the rapid Tertsch at bay, who took the lead for the Germans before tagging Lasse Luehers at the 42:47 mark. Dickinson, who had been handpicked by the GB selectors for his relay prowess, was tagged in one second behind, with Switzerland four seconds down, followed by Spain and USA 13 seconds from the lead. Behind them, Mexico, Brazil, Portugal, Italy, and Norway tagged in their athletes for the third leg.\n\nDickinson (GBR) made quick work of taking the lead on the swim, with Luehers (DEU) on his feet, followed by Friedelance - who was such a late replacement for the race he hadn't even had time to find a Swiss tri suit to fit.\n\nThe front three were followed into T1 by a second trio of Vasco Vilaca (POR), Alessio Crociani (ITA) and Pearson (USA), who swallowed up Friedelance quickly.\n\nLuehers and Dickinson were exchanging turns at the front and by the first lap of the bike were 16 seconds clear of the chase pack, but needed to keep the pressure on as Vilaca, in particular, was pushing hard.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristian Blummenfelt had taken over from the Norwegians for a rare mixed relay outing, but had 37 seconds to make up on the lead. Further back, individual men's bronze medalist Bergere was making progress on Team France's deficit, buoyed the vocifeous home-crowd noise.\n\nBesides, Dickinson was on a tear. The Brit was imperious on the run, even managing to open a gap on Luehrs in the second lap before handing over to Potter at the 1:03:06 mark. Five seconds later, Luehrs tagged in Lindemann (DEU). 20 seconds down from the front, Vilaco handed off Team Portugal's fate to Maria Tome, closely followed by Crociani and Pearson, with the U.S. firmly in contention for a medal. American anchor Taylor Knibb set off with determination to bring home the hardware.\n\nIt was Potter versus Lindemann, the same final leg scenario as it was in the 2023 Paris test event, although last summer there hadn't been a swim. Would that prove decisive? As Potter made her return swim into the current, she had a few seconds to think about either going alone on the bike or sharing duties with Lindemann to stay clear, trusting in her run ability. Potter set out on the bike with a lead of 11 seconds - how much of that time would she keep in the ensuing miles?\n\nKnibb, who had lamented her swim in the individual race, produced a storming effort to come out clear in third, 23 seconds down on Potter by the time she mounted the bike, but only 12 seconds adrift of Lindemann. The rest of the field looked too far back: the medals would be decided by the this trio.\n\nThe Boulder-based star was once again time-trialing on the streets of Paris, but unlike last Saturday in the cycling TT, she looked strong and confident. Knibb was up to Lindemann's wheel within the first lap and instantly attacked, the German desperately hanging on.\n\nThrough lap one of the bike, Knibb had halved the gap to Potter at the front, and by the time they came to the turn before transition, the two were together. As a spectacle and showcase for the mixed relay triathlon format, it was exciting, unpredictable, and unbeatable.\n\nKnibb was first to dismount, but Potter quickest out of transition. Lindemann had a few seconds to make up. Beaugrand arrived in fourth place a minute later with the chase pack - a valiant fightback, but not what France was racing for.\n\nThrough lap one, Knibb had moved into the lead, with Potter and Lindemann breathing down her neck. As they came down the blue carpet, it was anyone's race - and in the final kick, it was Lindemann who proved the victor, grabbing the finish line tape it was Lindemann nd her kick was ultimately enough to clinch gold.", "source": {"uri": "triathlete.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Triathlete"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_heming@triathlete.com", "name": "Tim Heming", "type": "author",

Prior to now, Paris 2024 had been optimistic the event would go ahead on Monday. On Saturday morning, Thomas Bach, the IOC president, had boasted that the event on the river was \"Seinesational\".\n\nIn good news for Team GB, however, Great Britain's Alex Yee and Beth Potter have experienced no ill effects after taking gold and bronze respectively in the individual events. The men's race had been postponed by 24 hours on Tuesday after heavy rainfall over the weekend contributed to increased pollution in the river. Since then, there have been several short outbreaks of rain in heatwave-hit Paris - including one thunderstorm on Thursday night.\n\nParis 2024 confirmed it cancelled Saturday's swim familiarisation \"at the daily meeting to review water quality\" on Friday evening. \"Given the heavy rain over recent days, which have been particularly intense upstream of the Paris basin, and the expected drop in water quality as a result, it has been decided, by anticipation, to cancel the familiarisation swim on Saturday, 03 August,\" organisers said.\n\nOrganisers have yet to update the situation but Tim Heming, a specialist triathlon writer, cited Fluidion Open Data Initiative tests which showed \"water quality in the Seine has worsened over the past two days, with e-coli readings far above World Triathlon's acceptable limits for swimming\". The Fluidion tests are independent of the ones used by Paris 2024 in its decision making.\n\nThere are reports that one non-British athlete has already been replaced in the mixed team relay after falling ill. The open water marathon swims are scheduled for August 9.

In a press release, the organizers stated: \"Paris 2024 and World Triathlon reiterate that their priority is the health of the athletes. The tests carried out in Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held.\"\n\nOrganizers are blaming the situation on heavy rains over the weekend, which typically spur a decline in water quality, but the disgusting state of the water has been a concern since long before the games started.\n\nIn fact, it has been illegal to swim in the Seine for a century, so it was surprising that they announced they intended to hold swimming events there in the first place. Apparently, the organizers were more interested in \"showing off\" their city than protecting the health of elite athletes from around the world.\n\nThey spent $1.5 billion cleaning up the river, and the city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, took a dip in the water earlier this month in what was said to be a display of her confidence that the water is safe.\n\nAlthough a new rainwater storage basin that was meant to alleviate water pollution issues managed to stop 40 million liters of wastewater and rainwater from making their way into the Seine after the weekend's rain, E. coli levels have been spiking, hitting around 2,000 CFU/100mL at the race's starting point, the Alexandra III Bridge. This is double the level required for the water quality to be considered \"good\" under World Triathlon standards.\n\nWhen E. coli levels surpass 1,000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon must be canceled under competition rules unless an organization's medical committee deems it permissible to proceed. Two consecutive days of practice were canceled, which meant prospective competitors could not prepare for what is typically one of the most challenging parts of a triathlon in the biggest sporting event in many of their lives.\n\nUniversity of Florida infectious disease specialist Dr. Nicole Iovine told AP: \"The problem is always worse when there's a heavy rainfall, because it kind of overwhelms the pipes and you also get all the runoff from the street. All that lands in the Seine. They've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the water. But the truth is you're at the mercy of Mother Nature.\"\n\nAlthough most strains of E. coli are considered harmless, some can be extremely dangerous, and taking in just a mouthful of the water could be enough to cause diarrhea, vomiting and infections of the intestines and urinary tract.\n\nIt's amusing to observe how the organizers seem to be depending on God's good graces to get the weather to cooperate, hoping that higher temperatures and sunny weather will help E. coli levels drop below the limit needed to allow swimming to move forward.\n\nAfter the way they mocked a sacred moment in Christianity, the Last Supper, with drag queens representing Jesus and the apostles in their opening ceremony, it's interesting to see them suddenly depending on a higher power.", "source": {"uri": "naturalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NaturalNews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escarpment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Escarpment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urinary system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Last Supper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface runoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2024/08/Paris-Olympics-Opening-Ceremony-Last-Supper-Blue-Man.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Coli scare, water quality of Siene in question", "body": "If there's one takeaway from this Summer Olympics, it's this: The Seine River is not the place for a casual dip, let alone an Olympic swim.\n\nThe Belgian team was gearing up for their triathlon, their spirits high and their hopes higher. But the infamous Seine had other plans. Despite a staggering $1.5 billion attempt to cleanse its waters, the triathlon events faced delays due to dangerously high levels of E. Coli. For the Belgian athletes, this wasn't just an inconvenience; it was a looming threat.\n\nClaire Michel, a key member of the Belgian team, plunged into the murky waters of the Seine during the women's triathlon. A few days later, she was sidelined, her health mysteriously declining. The Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee had no choice but to withdraw their mixed relay triathlon team. What was supposed to be a triumphant moment turned into a health crisis, all thanks to the toxic waters of Paris's most famous river.\n\nWednesday's race was the breaking point. As athletes battled the river and each other, one Canadian triathlete's dramatic vomiting episode post-race caught everyone's attention. While it was uncertain if the river was the direct cause, it painted a grim picture of the Seine's condition. Michel's illness only added fuel to the fire, as whispers of other athletes falling ill began to spread.\n\nBelgium wasn't alone in their plight. Several athletes experienced health issues after swimming in the Seine, though few dared to publicly blame the river. Yet, the connection was hard to ignore. Michel's sickness became the unfortunate symbol of a broader issue, casting a shadow over the Olympic festivities.\n\nThe Belgians, driven by dreams of gold, found themselves confronting an unexpected adversary: the very waters they trained to conquer. Their withdrawal wasn't just a setback; it was a glaring indictment of the failed $1.5 billion cleanup effort. If such a colossal investment couldn't ensure safe waters, what could?\n\nAs the games progressed, the Seine's reputation deteriorated further. Michel's story resonated, highlighting the risks these athletes took. The Belgian team's ordeal served as a stark reminder that sometimes, the biggest battles aren't against competitors but the environment itself.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claire Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/6f8b47b8e3c88840ec35dd99b6cc76af/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/08/05/17228235465104.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788308", "eventUri": "eng-9788308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Fleetwood caught him in two holes as Rahm had a stunning collapse.\n\nScheffler, who charged to the front with four straight birdies down the stretch, none bigger than gouging an 8-iron shot out of deep rough on the 17th hole and making the 18-foot birdie putt to take the lead.\n\nHe set an Olympic record for 72 holes at 19-under 265.\n\nFleetwood was second after a 66, and Hideki Matsuyama took the bronze medal at 17 under after a 65. Rahm tied for sixth at 15 under after a 70.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik is leaning into his new-found stardom as a geeky, bespectacled, Rubik's Cube-solving video gamer who just won two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"It's still just surreal to me. I wake up in the morning, I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm a two-time Olympic medallist!' It is so cool,\" he said.\n\nWith both medals hanging around his neck, he beamed and laughed as he marvelled at his rise to fame and the attention his specialty in gymnastics was receiving.\n\nThe 25-year-old US gymnast finished third in the pommel horse on Sunday, five days after helping the American men's team earn bronze -- its first Olympic medal in 16 years.\n\nAlong the way, he's captured the hearts of Olympics viewers with his endearing personality and nerdy tendencies.\n\nImages and clips of Nedoroscik removing his glasses and centring himself before hopping on the pommel horse for a focused routine have gone viral.\n\nThe memes and tweets have likened him to Clark Kent taking off his glasses and transforming into a hero.\n\n\"The memes are hilarious and I'm loving them all,\" he said.\n\nNedoroscik is one of several athletes who have captured the imagination of Olympic watchers online, including \"Turkish dad\" and \"cheese wheel gymnast\".\n\nOlympic swimmers spoke out about the Chinese doping scandal that has hung over the Paris Olympics as the events finished on Monday morning.\n\nChina won the men's 4x100m medley relay in 3 minutes, 27.46 seconds, with two of the four members on the team listed among 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive ahead of the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nThe swimmers were allowed to compete after a Chinese investigation ruled that they consumed food that had been contaminated.\n\n\"In sport, one of my favourite quotes I've seen lately is 'there's no point in winning if you don't win it fair,'\" British star Adam Peaty said after his foursome wound up fourth to miss the medal stand.\n\n\"I think you know that truth in your heart. Even if you touch and you know you're cheating, you're not winning, right? So, for me, if you've been on that and you have been contaminated twice, I think as an honourable person it means you should be out of the sport. We know sport is not that simple.\n\n\"I don't want to paint a whole nation or a whole group of people with one brush, I think it's very unfair.\n\n\"But there have been two cases of it and I think it's very disappointing, and I've tried to keep out of the conversations until now for the betterment of the team but I think we're going to use that to our advantage the next four years, whether I'm there or not. I know these boys will carry that.\n\n\"We'll see how they do in four years' time, but I think the people that need to do the job will wake up and do the job.\"\n\nQin Haiyang and Sun Jiajun were on the winning relay team and were on the list of Chinese swimmers who tested positive for a banned substance before the Tokyo Games but were allowed to compete.\n\n\"The whole Olympic Games journey for me is great,\" Xu said.\n\n\"I am very satisfied.\"\n\nBoxer Cindy Ngamba made history on Monday morning by becoming the first athlete competing as a refugee to clinch an Olympic medal.\n\nThe 25-year-old, originally from Cameroon, offered hope for the Refugee Olympic Team that was created to call attention to the plight of refugees across the world.\n\nNgamba's victory at the Paris Games comes after a fierce bout with French boxer Davina Michel in the women's 75kg quarterfinals in front of a passionate French crowd.\n\nNgamba, who screamed and pumped her fist when she won, has scored at least a bronze medal as she advances to the semifinals.\n\nShe will face Atheyna Bylon, who ensured that Panama would get its fourth-ever Olympic medal with her own win shortly after Ngamba's fight.\n\n\"It means the world to me to be the first-ever refugee to win a medal,\" Ngamba told reporters.\n\n\"I want to say to all the refugees around the world ... keep on working hard, keep on believing in yourself.\"\n\nShe was a flag-bearer for the 37 athletes making up the biggest Refugee Olympic Team since the idea was born ahead of the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee created the team as a way for displaced athletes and migrants to participate fully in the Olympics without help from national federations.\n\nNgamba moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 11 and said she was granted refugee status in 2021 because she could have been imprisoned for being gay in Cameroon.\n\nShe has said boxing has been her escape from the chaos -- it's also lifted her up to the international stage.\n\nWe knew the sleeping situation in the village was bad, but we didn't know it was this bad.\n\nItalian gold medallist Thomas Ceccon has been snapped sleeping on the ground in a park inside the Olympic Village, just days after publicly complaining about how difficult it was to get some sleep in the provided beds.\n\nCeccon won gold in the 100m backstroke but failed to reach the 200m backstroke final.\n\n\"There is no air conditioning in the village, it's hot, the food is bad,\" Ceccon said.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that I didn't make the final, but I was too tired. It's hard to sleep both at night and in the afternoon. Here, I really struggle between the heat and the noise.\"\n\nThere is no suggestion Ceccon spent the night in the park, and it was likely just a quick nap caught by fellow athlete and Saudi rower Husein Alireza.\n\nBut the quality -- or lack thereof -- of the sleeping arrangements in the village continues to be a point of contention for the athletes.\n\nKishane Thompson let out a scream after crossing the finish line that was fitting of an Olympic 100m champion. Because, for a brief moment, he thought maybe he was.\n\nBy the slimmest of margins, Thompson was beaten out for gold on a perfectly timed lean from American Noah Lyles on Monday morning.\n\nTheir times of 9.79 seconds needed to be calculated farther out to determine the winner -- with Lyles winning 9.784 to 9.789. Thompson was five-thousandths of a second away from joining the company of fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt as an Olympic champion.\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"But I am happy at the same time. I am going to take it as what it is and move forward from here.\"\n\nSomeone asked Thompson soon after if he thought the gold medal could be shared, since it was that close a race.\n\nIt would be a nod to the high jumpers at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar agreed to split the gold medal.\n\nSomehow, Thompson didn't think Lyles would go for the idea.\n\n\"I think the sport is too competitive, no offence to any other sport,\" the 23-year-old Thompson said.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting

The other had the heat.\n\nBoth had the scenery and, of course, the Seine.\n\nAfter a couple of canceled swim practices and a delay because of the river's water quality, the women's and men's Olympic triathlon races finished Wednesday in spectacular fashion -- on the Pont Alexandre III bridge spanning the famed waterway with the Eiffel Tower in the background.\n\n\"It's magical,\" said newly minted gold medalist Cassandre Beaugrand of France. \"It's the best route we've had in a long time and I know all the other athletes feel the same.\"\n\nBeaugrand captured the women's Olympic triathlon by making her way through a Seine River that was under scrutiny for its water quality and navigating slippery roads that turned the cycling portion into a series of spills following an early morning rain.\n\nOn the men's side, which started less than an hour after the women finished, there was plenty of stifling heat and humidity to deal with as the sun came out in full force. Alex Yee of Britain used a burst at the end to catch and pass Hayden Wilde of New Zealand to win the gold medal by six seconds.\n\n\"Everyone suffered in the heat,\" Wilde said. \"Everyone was in the same position. It was just really nice that we could race a day after the delay and just go with the flow.\"\n\nHolding the race in France's second-longest river was all part of an ambitious plan to clean up the long-polluted Seine. Organizers have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nAt times, the athletes had to feel almost like tourists, given the views. They cycled and sprinted past the Grand Palais, along the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es and were close to the Arc de Triomphe. An extra loop for cycling took them past the parliament building, the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\n\n\"We were lucky enough to have probably the most beautiful venue of any race in the Olympics,\" Yee said. \"I guess that came with the small penalty at the risk of the Seine being dirty.\"\n\nThe men's race was originally supposed to take place on Tuesday but got postponed because of elevated levels of bacteria in the water. The organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards.\n\n\"For me, you've got to have trust in the organization that they're going to put you in safe conditions,\" said Yee, who won silver at the Tokyo Games. \"I'm sure we'll find out in due time if that's correct.\"\n\nBeaugrand finished the run on top of the bridge and collapsed to the ground in exhaustion and exhilaration. It was on top of the Paris 2024 logo, with a home crowd cheering her on. Her time of 1 hour, 54 minutes, 55 seconds edged Julie Derron of Switzerland by six seconds. Beth Potter of Britain captured bronze.\n\n\"To do this in front of our crowd was something that had to be done, and I still can't believe it,\" Beaugrand said.\n\nIt was quite a finish in the men's race, too, with Yee summoning every ounce of remaining energy in the extreme heat to surge past Wilde. Leo Bergere earned another medal for France by taking bronze.\n\n\"It was just a clean, fair race with the both of us, and I think that's what we're most proud of and most stoked of,\" Wilde said of his race with Yee. \"It was everything we dreamed of -- an epic battle.\"\n\nA steady rain subsided just before the women dove into the water. Derron said water quality wasn't on her mind -- only a medal.\n\n\"I knew it was race day, and I knew what I had to do,\" Derron said. \"So you don't have time to focus on anything around that.\n\n\"It felt normal. It felt a bit cold, especially because it was raining before the race. So I felt a bit chilly before the start, but the water is just normal water. Of course, the strong current on the way back, that made it harder, but other than that, it's just normal water.\"\n\nThe tricky part proved to be on the bike and racing through the wet streets. Romina Biagioli of Argentina fell off her bike on Lap 2, her water bottles rolling away.\n\n\"It was a nice course, but with the rain it was dangerous,\" she said. \"It was nice but dangerous.\"\n\nAs for swimming in the Seine, Biagioli said she would've preferred more practice time to prepare for its currents.\n\n\"I wasn't worried about the pollution,\" Biagioli said. \"I was worried about how it could affect me not to try it before the race.\"\n\nYee is hopeful this race sparks a Parisian triathlon trend.\n\n\"Fair play to France and the government that we're able to hopefully create a legacy and for that to live on post our race,\" Yee said. \"Hopefully some people watching today can then go and try the sport for the first time in a place where they probably could never before.\"\n\nAP

A look at the risks risks of swimming in polluted water.\n\nWater contamination in the Seine River was a controversial topic right up to the opening ceremony at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nIt was deemed safe on July 17, 2024, and open for the first time in about a century. A women's swimming event went ahead, but was followed by the news that a men's event was to postponed and rescheduled.\n\nThen, Olympics swimmers started to fall sick.\n\nPollution in the Seine is no new controversy -- swimming in the river has been illegal for more than 100 years due to health concerns. The first ban came into effect in 1923, causing swimmers during the 1924 Paris Olympic games to compete in swimming pools.\n\nMost of the city's wastewater has been flowing into the Seine since the ban came into effect. Leaking and overflowing sewage systems are the main source of pollution.\n\nFrench authorities have been working to clean up the water for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, spending \u20ac1.4 billion ($1.5 billion) on improving water quality.\n\nThe goal was to cut bacterial contamination by 75% before the first Olympic swimming event, but the city has so far been unsuccessful in quelling the concerns of athletes and local Parisians.\n\nParisians disgruntled at the project's costs pledged to protest poo in the Seine en masse, led by #JeChieDansLaSeineLe23Juin, which translates as # I shit in the Seine on June 23.\n\nDespite this campaign, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier in July in a bid to demonstrate the Seine's cleanliness first-hand.\n\nWater tests from the Eau de Paris monitoring group showed levels of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the river were significantly higher than is safe to humans over the last weeks.\n\nRainfall over Paris made the issue worse -- heavy rains often cause levels of E. coli and other bacterial colonies in rivers and lakes to rise.\n\nIn a statement, organizers said that heavy rain over Paris on the first weekend of the games had compelled them to reschedule events \"for health reasons.\"\n\nE. coli is often linked to fecal matter in water and can indicate contamination from sewage. Even a mouthful of contaminated water containing high levels of E.coli can lead to diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia or sepsis. Skin rashes and ear or eye pain are also common.\n\nE. coli infections are not the only concern, however. Leptospira, transmitted by rodent urine, can be found in contaminated water and can cause severe kidney disease.\n\nInfections from other waterborne bacteria like cyanobacteria and enterococci can also cause gut-related health problems.\n\nAnd then there are parasites such as cercarial larvae, often found in water populated by waterfowl, which can cause itchy skin rashes.\n\nSeth Rider, one of 55 triathletes entered in the men's race, has been taking unconventional measures to prepare for exposure to bacteria.\n\n\"We know that there's going to be some E. coli exposure, so I just try to increase my E. coli threshold by exposing myself to a bit of E. coli in your day-to-day life,\" the US athlete said in a press conference.\n\n\"Just little things throughout your day, like, not washing your hands after you go to the bathroom and stuff like this,\" he said.\n\nOther Olympic athletes have suffered long-term from swimming in contaminated waters, however.

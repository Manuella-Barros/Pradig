{"id": 225025266, "title": "Deadline nears for victims to file in Baltimore Catholic church case", "text": "Born into a family of devout Catholics, Marc Floto was almost destined to be an altar boy at his local church, the former Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Baltimore County. So when he was 5 or 6 years old, his parents \u201cpretty much pushed\u201d him to do just that. But they had no idea about the life-altering consequences that came with that commitment, said Floto, 62. \u201cWhen I was an altar boy, I used to go to the rectory \u2026 to get dressed in our robes and that, to get ready for Mass,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t recall when, but things progressed from the priest touching me, to fondling me, amongst other things.\u201d Floto lives near Westminster and owns a towing business now; he\u2019s married and has a son. But being abused as a child, he said, \u201ccaused turmoil every step of\u201d his life. He chokes up when he explains the impact of what he endured, from persistent anger and trust issues to being overprotective of those he holds dear. Like many survivors of clergy sexual abuse in Maryland, Floto was preparing last fall to sue the Archdiocese of Baltimore, but had to change course when the church declared bankruptcy. He is one of hundreds who has submitted a \u201cproof of claim\u201d form in the archdiocese\u2019s case ahead of a Friday deadline for victims to add themselves to a list for future compensation. Known as a \u201cbar date,\u201d the deadline is \u201creally a survivor\u2019s last chance to file against the bankrupt entity, which in this case is the Baltimore diocese,\u201d said attorney Adam Slater, whose firm represents Floto and other victims. \u201cI encourage anybody with a claim, or anybody who was sexually abused, to please come forward, because this is most likely your last chance.\u201d Slater called the midnight Friday deadline \u201cpart of the cruelty of the bankruptcy process\u201d because it limits the period survivors have to pursue legal recourse, effectively sidestepping the groundbreaking law Maryland enacted last year that erased time restraints for abuse lawsuits in state court. The Child Victims Act followed the release of a state attorney general report that said 156 clergy and other church officials tormented more than 600 children and young adults, dating to the 1940s. The abuse spanned Baltimore and the nine counties in Central and Western Maryland that make up the diocese\u2019s jurisdiction. Anticipating hundreds of lawsuits, the church chose to protect its assets and limit its liability by filing for bankruptcy Sept. 29, two days before the law took effect. Church officials said bankruptcy would allow the archdiocese to compensate all victims, rather than providing immense sums of money to a few, while continuing its mission. The church\u2019s decision meant survivors\u2019 potential lawsuits had to be reconfigured into proof-of-claim forms and supporting documents. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michelle M. Harner set the May 31 deadline for such claims, requiring the archdiocese to publicize that date. The church advertised on news platforms and put the word out in its parishes, among other means. Philip C. Federico, an attorney who is representing dozens of survivors, told The Baltimore Sun that he is concerned that notice won\u2019t reach all victims, arguing the archdiocese\u2019s efforts to cover up widespread abuse make it more difficult to reach those impacted. \u201cThere\u2019s no database of survivors of sexual abuse by members of the Archdiocese of Baltimore\u2019s clergy,\u201d Federico said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no way to give all the survivors adequate notice.\u201d Survivors\u2019 attorneys will attempt to add an avenue for people to file late if they have a \u201creasonable\u201d reason for missing the deadline, such as \u201cpeople who live abroad or people who are in the service,\u201d Federico said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a heavy burden to overcome.\u201d As of May 20, about 320 claims had been filed, but several law firms had yet to file hundreds, said Paul Jan Zdunek, chair of the committee of survivors representing all victims in the bankruptcy case. \u201cThere will probably be closer to 600 to 1,000 claims, based on what we\u2019re hearing anecdotally,\u201d Zdunek told The Sun. Almost all of the hundreds of abuse claims submitted thus far have been shielded from public view. Broderick Miller, who said a deacon raped him and introduced him to heroin, leading to a lifetime of addiction and related arrests, filed his claim publicly. While claims filed confidentially are kept from the public, they are reviewed by attorneys and experts in the case. Zdunek, who said he was sexually abused as a child by a Boy Scout leader, a Catholic middle school teacher and a member of a choir connected to the school, harked back in an interview to a recent conversation with a friend who was abused alongside him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to file because he was worried about what his family would think, his friends,\u201d Zdunek said. \u201cI want to assure everybody that this is completely anonymous. Nobody has to know. Their name won\u2019t be out there.\u201d Zdunek himself was in the process of completing his claim with a lawyer when he spoke to a reporter. He said a lawyer can make the process seamless, either walking a survivor through the steps of completing a claim form or filling the document out for their client. \u201cThe most difficult part of it is reliving and remembering the abuse because it does ask certain pieces of information about the abuse: When, where, who?\u201d Zdunek said. \u201cIt\u2019s more emotional than it is painful from an administrative standpoint.\u201d As survivors prepared their claims, attorneys in the case worked to determine how much money the archdiocese and its insurers will contribute to eventually compensate survivors. The survivors committee also has discussed with the church measures to prevent future sexual abuse of children, which will be part of the final settlement. That process of determining how much the church and insurance companies will pay is expected to ramp up during forthcoming mediation, or \u201cPhase 2\u201d of the bankruptcy case, as attorney Elisha Hawk called it. \u201cPhase 2 is the longest, and quietest, and sometimes the most frustrating for survivors because it is confidential,\u201d said Hawk, whose firm represents survivors in Maryland and has participated in bankruptcy cases involving other archdioceses, in an email. \u201cIn the coming days, there will be a joint motion filed to appoint a couple of mediators with the goal of working toward mediation.\u201d Zdunek and Jonathan Schochor, another attorney who represents victims in the case, predicted that mediation would begin over the summer. After mediation, the survivors\u2019 committee will come up with criteria for how to categorize abuse claims, said Hawk, adding that \u201call survivors will be able to see [the criteria] and vote on that before the court approves it.\u201d Schochor said experts who are \u201cforensically inclined\u201d will be brought in later to evaluate the claims, determining how much money each person\u2019s experience is worth. \u201cThe claims,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be placed into tiers.\u201d", "summary": "Hundreds of people like Marc Floto, who survived clergy sexual abuse in Maryland, filed claims in the Archdiocese of Baltimore's bankruptcy case ahead of a Friday deadline.", "url": "https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/05/29/archdiocese-bankruptcy-survivor-deadline/", "image": "https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CXN3OVQA7QPDXCRAMN5KZOZXGE.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:43:31", "author": "Alex Mann", "authors": ["Alex Mann"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.078}

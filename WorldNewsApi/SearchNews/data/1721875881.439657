{"id": 239763744, "title": "Blues plan new Omorodion bid", "text": "Chelsea are planning to submit a new bid for Atletico Madrid striker Samu Omorodion after seeing an initial approach rejected by the La Liga side, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The Blues initially tested the waters with an offer of around \u00a333.8m for the 20-year-old, which would have seen Atletico receive approximately \u00a325.4m up front and the rest in add-ons. However, Diego Simeone\u2019s side swiftly rejected Chelsea\u2019s offer, as they consider Omorodion a key prospect for the future following his successful loan spell at Alaves. The Spanish-Nigerian striker netted eight goals in 35 matches during the 2023/24 campaign before joining Atletico for just \u20ac6m (\u00a35.1m) from Granada. Omorodion is not due to become a free agent for another four years, meaning Atletico are under no pressure to sell the youngster, who is also on West Ham United\u2019s radar. Nevertheless, according to Football Insider, Atletico are braced to receive a second bid for the striker from Chelsea, who have not been deterred by their initial rejection. The report adds that the Blues view Omorodion as a player with the skill set to make a name for himself in the Premier League, despite being an \u2018unknown quantity,\u2019 which means a deal is still up in the air. Standing at 6ft 4in tall, Omorodion is still waiting to make his senior debut for Atletico Madrid but has two goals from seven appearances for Spain\u2019s Under-21 side. He made just one senior appearance for Granada before joining Simeone\u2019s side, scoring against Atletico themselves in a 3-1 La Liga defeat. The Spain youth international is one of several offensive targets on Chelsea\u2019s shortlist for the summer window. However, the Blues have already faced setbacks, with Michael Olise from Crystal Palace reportedly opting to join Bayern Munich instead.", "summary": "<p>Chelsea are planning to submit a new bid for Atletico Madrid striker Samu Omorodion after seeing an initial approach rejected by the La Liga side, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.

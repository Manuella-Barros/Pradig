She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nCanada 2, New Zealand 1\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

New Zealand's coach, Jitka Klimkova, decided to step aside for the Olympics in late June after an independent workplace employment investigation.\n\nKlimkova was cleared in the investigation, but she did not feel there was enough time to heal the environment before the tournament.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nU.S. 3, Zambia 0\n\nMallory Swanson scored a pair of goals just moments apart in the first half and the United States opened the Olympics with a 3-0 victory over Zambia on Thursday night, giving new coach Emma Hayes a win in her first major tournament with the team.\n\nTrinity Rodman also scored for the United States, which is looking to add a record fifth gold medal to its Olympic collection.\n\nZambia was hurt in the 33rd minute when Pauline Zulu was sent off with a red card and the team was limited to 10 players the rest of the way. Zulu sobbed as she left the field.\n\nHayes took over the U.S. team in late May after finishing out the season with Chelsea in the Women's Super League. She shook things up a bit with her roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, she had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nFrance 3, Colombia 2\n\nFrance built a 3-0 lead in the first half and held off Colombia in Lyon.\n\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto scored a pair of goals and Kenza Dali added another for the hosts in Group A.\n\nCatalina Usme converted on a penalty early in the second half for Colombia, which was returning to the Olympics after missing out on the Tokyo Games. Manuela Pavi helped close the gap further with another goal in the 64th.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start.

Zulu sobbed as she left the field.\n\nHayes took over the U.S. team in late May after finishing out the season with Chelsea in the Women's Super League. She shook things up a bit with her roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, she had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nCanada 2, New Zealand 1\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability.

The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nFrance 3, Colombia 2\n\nFrance built a 3-0 lead in the first half and held off Colombia in Lyon.\n\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto scored a pair of goals and Kenza Dali added another for the hosts in Group A.\n\nCatalina Usme converted on a penalty early in the second half for Colombia, which was returning to the Olympics after missing out on the Tokyo Games. Manuela Pavi helped close the gap further with another goal in the 64th.\n\n___\n\nAP Soccer Writer James Robson, in Marseille, France, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_m_peterson@seattletimes.com", "name": "Anne M.

Zulu sobbed as she left the field.\n\nHayes took over the U.S. team in late May after finishing out the season with Chelsea in the Women's Super League. She shook things up a bit with her roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\n\"If you had asked me at the beginning of the game, 'Would you be happy with a 3-nil win?' I probably would have said no,\" Hayes said. \"However, after the performance and the chances created and finding the back of the net we did, I don't want to be too hard on the girls.\"\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nSwanson called it just a start.\n\n\"I think there's little things within that game, within the play, that we need to fine-tune, that we can just keep on growing with,\" Swanson said. \"So I think there's definitely those little things, and we'll address them and fix them and keep moving forward.\"\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\n\"A lot of credit to Zambia's goalkeeper tonight, because in the first half I think we had a sequence of like six shots in a row that she saved or went off the post,\" Horan said. \"And sometimes that how it goes. I was really happy it wasn't one of those days where the ball just doesn't go in the back of the net.\"\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through the U.S. defense, which was stout throughout the match.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, she had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nThe United States will next face Germany on Sunday in Marseille.\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nFrance built a 3-0 lead in the first half and held off Colombia in Lyon.\n\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto scored a pair of goals and Kenza Dali added another for the hosts in Group A.\n\nCatalina Usme converted on a penalty early in the second half for Colombia, which was returning to the Olympics after missing out on the Tokyo Games. Manuela Pavi helped close the gap further with another goal in the 64th.\n\n___\n\nAP Soccer Writer James Robson, in Marseille, France, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "beaumontenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beaumont Enterprise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_m_peterson@beaumontenterprise.com", "name": "Anne M.

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward and Portland Thorns star Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League.

However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start.

However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nNew Zealand announced a day before the match that captain Ali Riley could not play in the Olympics because of an unspecified injury.\n\nJayde Riviere of Canada was ruled unavailable earlier Thursday because of an ankle injury. Shelina Zadorsky replaced her on the roster for the match.\n\nThe Ferns, playing under interim coach Michael Mayne, were making their fifth straight Olympic appearance. New Zealand's coach, Jitka Klimkova, decided to step aside for the Olympics in late June after an independent workplace employment investigation.\n\nKlimkova was cleared in the investigation, but she did not feel there was enough time to heal the environment before the tournament.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nNigeria advanced to the knockout round at last year's Women's World Cup.\n\nAP Soccer Writer James Robson, in Marseille, France, contributed to this report.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_m_peterson@santamariatimes.com", "name": "Anne M.

Zulu sobbed as she left the field.\n\nHayes took over the U.S. team in late May after finishing out the season with Chelsea in the Women's Super League. She shook things up a bit with her roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, she had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nFrance built a 3-0 lead in the first half and held off Colombia in Lyon.\n\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto scored a pair of goals and Kenza Dali added another for the hosts in Group A.\n\nCatalina Usme converted on a penalty early in the second half for Colombia, which was returning to the Olympics after missing out on the Tokyo Games. Manuela Pavi helped close the gap further with another goal in the 64th.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_m_peterson@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Anne M.

New Zealand's coach, Jitka Klimkova, decided to step aside for the Olympics in late June after an independent workplace employment investigation.\n\nKlimkova was cleared in the investigation, but she did not feel there was enough time to heal the environment before the tournament.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nNigeria advanced to the knockout round at last year's Women's World Cup.\n\nAP Soccer Writer James Robson, in Marseille, France, contributed to this report.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_m_peterson@register-herald.com", "name": "Anne M.

New Zealand in St Etienne in Group A.\n\nCloe Lacasse and Evelyne Viens scored on a night that might have been a routine group win for Canada before it was thrust into the global spotlight due to a

minnows, whose best Olympic finish was a quarter-final appearance in 2012, and Lacasse levelled in first-half added time, stabbing home from close-range after some exquisite passing.\n\nViens netted the winner in the 79th minute in front of a sparse crowd at Geoffrey-Guichard Stadium, when she ran onto a pinpoint long pass from Jessie Fleming and fired first-time into the far corner from a tight angle.\n\nWomen's football continues with medal contenders Germany, Australia, Brazil and the United States kicking off their Olympic campaigns later on Thursday.", "source": {"uri":

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNew business coming to Davenport's former Bed Bath & Beyond Deere held employee meeting Wednesday, no word yet on potential layoffs for Quad-Cities Two injured in shooting at NorthPark Mall in Davenport Monday Witnesses describe gunfire at NorthPark Mall that injured 2 Davenport code enforcement officer quits after argument with boss over Wold-owned duplex Quad-Cities business openings: New furniture store coming to Davenport, other happenings Teen arrested in relation to shooting at NorthPark Mall in Davenport Several Davenport teens accused of gang crimes; police report group violence down overall Second person dies after Friday house fire in Riverdale Arrowhead Ranch items up for online auction after facility's closure Northwest Bank acquired by Chicago-area bank Davenport developer pulls 16-unit central city development at Sixth and Sylvan One injured in Scott County motorcycle crash Iowa nursing home resident suffocated while trapped in bed rails, state says First Senior Bix sees strong turnout ahead of 50th Quad-City Times Bix 7\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nCanada 2, New Zealand 1\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news

Olympic football opener", "body": "Paris (AFP) - Reigning Ballon d'Or Aitana Bonmati scored one goal and helped create another as World Cup holders Spain came from behind to beat Japan 2-1 in their first game of the women's Olympic football tournament on Thursday.\n\nSpain are making their Olympic women's football debut at the Paris Games but are leading contenders to win the gold medal after their World Cup triumph in Australia and New Zealand last year.\n\nThey fell behind against Japan in the western French city of Nantes to Aoba Fujino's early free-kick, but Bonmati soon equalised before Mariona Caldentey netted the winner in the 74th minute.\n\nIt is the perfect start for Spain in Group C, in which rivals Nigeria and Brazil meet later.\n\nWith 12 teams split into three groups of four, there is margin for error as the two best third-placed teams will advance to the quarter-finals.\n\nThat will provide some comfort for Japan, who won the silver medal at London 2012.\n\nSpain's starting XI featured seven players who were in the line-up for last year's World Cup final win over England in Sydney, plus Alexia Putellas, the two-time former Ballon d'Or winner.\n\nJapan's side included Hinata Miyazawa, the top scorer at the World Cup, but it was Fujino who opened the scoring in the 13th minute with a fine strike from a dead ball which proved too powerful for goalkeeper Cata Coll.\n\nHowever, Spain bossed possession and drew level midway through the first half when Bonmati was played in by Athenea del Castillo and rounded the goalkeeper to score.\n\nThey then grabbed what proved to be the winner when Caldentey came in from the left and played a quick exchange of passes with Bonmati before firing in.\n\nCanada shrug off spying scandal\n\nMeanwhile, reigning Olympic champions Canada shrugged off a spying scandal to come from behind and start their campaign with a 2-1 win over New Zealand in Saint-Etienne.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the lead before an embarrassingly sparse crowd at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, the same venue where the men's game between Argentina and Morocco was affected by crowd trouble on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, Arsenal's Cloe Lacasse levelled in first-half stoppage time for Canada, who beat Sweden on penalties in the final in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nEvelyne Viens then latched onto a long ball forward to fire in the winner 11 minutes from the end.\n\nCanada's build-up had been overshadowed after an assistant coach and an analyst were sent home from the Olympics on the eve of their opening game.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session this week in Saint-Etienne.\n\nLombardi pleaded guilty when he appeared in court in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday.\n\nThe assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported.\n\nHead coach Bev Priestman apologised and decided to take no part in the game against New Zealand as a result because she felt it would not be appropriate.\n\nCanada and New Zealand are in Group A along with hosts France and Colombia, who meet later in Lyon.\n\nRecord four-time gold medallists the United States meet Zambia later in Group B, which also sees Germany take on Australia.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com",

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward and former Stanford Star Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Bay FC's Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage. Kundananji signed with Bay FC on a record transfer fee of nearly $800,000 and has scored twice for the San Jose team this NWSL season.\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nBay FC forward Asisat Oshoala, the six-time African women's player of the year, did not see the field for Nigeria.\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long-range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\n___\n\nAP Soccer Writer James Robson, in Marseille, France, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"},

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nPeople are also reading...

U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nCanada 2, New Zealand 1\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nFrance 3, Colombia 2\n\nFrance built a 3-0 lead in the first half and held off Colombia in Lyon.\n\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto scored a pair of goals and Kenza Dali added another for the hosts in Group A.\n\nCatalina Usme converted on a penalty early in the second half for Colombia, which was returning to the Olympics after missing out on the Tokyo Games. Manuela Pavi helped close the gap further with another goal in the 64th.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nNew Zealand announced a day before the match that captain Ali Riley could not play in the Olympics because of an unspecified injury.\n\nJayde Riviere of Canada was ruled unavailable earlier Thursday because of an ankle injury. Shelina Zadorsky replaced her on the roster for the match.\n\nThe Ferns, playing under interim coach Michael Mayne, were making their fifth straight Olympic appearance. New Zealand's coach, Jitka Klimkova, decided to step aside for the Olympics in late June after an independent workplace employment investigation.\n\nKlimkova was cleared in the investigation, but she did not feel there was enough time to heal the environment before the tournament.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nNigeria advanced to the knockout round at last year's Women's World Cup.\n\nAP Soccer Writer James Robson, in Marseille, France, contributed to this report.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_m_peterson@yakimaherald.com", "name": "Anne M.

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nPeople are also reading...

U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nCanada 2, New Zealand 1\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability.

The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her.

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

The assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported.\n\nHead coach Bev Priestman apologised and decided to take no part in the game against New Zealand as a result because she felt it would not be appropriate.\n\n\"As a Canadian, these are not our values. We are not cheats,\" said defender Vanessa Gilles, who described the episode as a \"humiliation\".\n\nCanada and New Zealand are in Group A along with hosts France and Colombia, who meet later in

Group C match of Olympics women's soccer competition in Nantes on Thursday.\n\nOlympic debutants Spain recovered from going behind to an early goal to avenge a 4-0 group stage loss to the Asians in last year's World Cup, which they went on to win.\n\nJapan opened the scoring in the 13th minute when Aoba Fujino's superb free kick sailed into the top right corner, with goalkeeper Cata Coll only managing to get a finger to it.\n\nBallon d'Or winner Bonmati equalised for Spain only nine minutes later with an easy finish off a through ball by Athenea del Castillo after they cut through Japan's defence.\n\nSpain dominated possession in the second half and took the lead in the 74th minute courtesy of a Mariona Caldentey strike following a Bonmati pass to go top of the group.\n\nElsewhere, reigning Olympic champions Canada also claimed a 2-1 comeback victory over New Zealand in St Etienne in the first day of action in Group A.\n\nWomen's football continues with medal contenders Germany,

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nPeople are also reading...

U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nCanada 2, New Zealand 1\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

However, the USA could not add any more goals with the extra player.\n\nAlso in Group B, 2016 gold medallists Germany outclassed Australia, winning 3-0 in Marseille with Marina Hegering and Lea Schueller both scoring headers before Jule Brand wrapped up the victory.\n\nThe USA and Germany meet each other in Marseille on Sunday.\n\n- Canada shrug off spying scandal -\n\nFrance survived a wobble to beat Colombia 3-2 in Lyon, where there were plenty of empty seats to greet the host nation.\n\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto scored twice in the first half either side of a Kenza Dali strike as France appeared to be cruising.\n\nHowever, Catalina Usme pulled one back from a penalty early in the second half and substitute Manuela Pavi further reduced the deficit before a red card for Mayra Ramirez ended Colombian hopes of snatching a point.\n\nIn the same Group A, reigning Olympic champions Canada shrugged off a spying scandal to claim a 2-1 win over New Zealand in Saint-Etienne.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the lead before a sparse crowd at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.\n\nArsenal's Cloe Lacasse levelled in first-half stoppage time for Canada, who beat Sweden on penalties in the final in Tokyo three years ago. Evelyne Viens then fired in the winner 11 minutes from time.\n\nCanada's build-up had been overshadowed after an assistant coach and an analyst were sent home from the Olympics on the eve of the game.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session this week in Saint-Etienne.\n\nHead coach Bev Priestman apologised and took no part in the game against New Zealand, feeling it would not be appropriate.\n\n\"As a Canadian, these are not our values. We are not cheats,\" said defender Vanessa Gilles, who described the episode as a \"humiliation\".\n\nas/dj", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nPeople are also reading...

U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nCanada 2, New Zealand 1\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

It is the perfect start for Spain in Group C, in which rivals Nigeria and Brazil meet later.\n\nWith 12 teams split into three groups of four, there is no margin for error as the two best third-placed teams will advance to the quarter-finals. That will provide some comfort for Japan, who won the silver medal at London 2012.\n\nSpain's starting XI featured seven players who were in the line-up for last year's World Cup final win over England in Sydney, plus Alexia Putellas, the two-time former Ballon d'Or winner.\n\nJapan's side included Hinata Miyazawa, the top scorer at the World Cup, but it was Fujino who opened the scoring in the 13th minute with a fine strike from a dead ball which proved too powerful for goalkeeper Cata Coll. However, Spain bossed possession and drew level midway through the first half when Bonmati was played in by Athenea del Castillo and rounded the goalkeeper to score. They then grabbed what proved to be the winner when Caldentey came in from the left and played a quick exchange of passes with Bonmati before firing in.\n\nMeanwhile, reigning Olympic champions Canada shrugged off a spying scandal to come from behind and start their campaign with a 2-1 win over New Zealand in Saint-Etienne.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the lead before an embarrassingly sparse crowd at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, the same venue where the men's game between Argentina and Morocco was affected by crowd trouble on Wednesday. However, Arsenal's Cloe Lacasse leveled in first-half stoppage time for Canada, who beat Sweden on penalties in the final in Tokyo three years ago. Evelyne Viens then latched onto a long ball forward to fire in the winner 11 minutes from the end.\n\nCanada's build-up had been overshadowed after an assistant coach and an analyst were sent home from the Olympics on the eve of their opening game. The analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session this week in Saint-Etienne. Lombardi pleaded guilty when he appeared in court in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday. The assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported. Head coach Bev Priestman apologized and decided to take no part in the game against New Zealand as a result because she felt it would not be appropriate.\n\nCanada and New Zealand are in Group A along with hosts France and Colombia, who meet later in Lyon. Record four-time gold medallists the United States meet Zambia later in Group B, which also sees Germany take on Australia.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nPeople are also reading...

At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nCanada 2, New Zealand 1\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute.

Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\n___\n\nAP Soccer Writer James Robson, in Marseille, France, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

However, the USA could not add any more goals with the extra player.\n\nAlso in Group B, 2016 gold medallists Germany outclassed Australia, winning 3-0 in Marseille with Marina Hegering and Lea Schueller both scoring headers before Jule Brand wrapped up the victory.\n\nThe USA and Germany meet each other in Marseille on Sunday.\n\n- Canada shrug off spying scandal -\n\nFrance survived a wobble to beat Colombia 3-2 in Lyon, where there were plenty of empty seats to greet the host nation.\n\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto scored twice in the first half either side of a Kenza Dali strike as France appeared to be cruising.\n\nHowever, Catalina Usme pulled one back from a penalty early in the second half and substitute Manuela Pavi further reduced the deficit before a red card for Mayra Ramirez ended Colombian hopes of snatching a point.\n\nIn the same Group A, reigning Olympic champions Canada shrugged off a spying scandal to claim a 2-1 win over New Zealand in Saint-Etienne.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the lead before a sparse crowd at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.\n\nArsenal's Cloe Lacasse levelled in first-half stoppage time for Canada, who beat Sweden on penalties in the final in Tokyo three years ago. Evelyne Viens then fired in the winner 11 minutes from time.\n\nCanada's build-up had been overshadowed after an assistant coach and an analyst were sent home from the Olympics on the eve of the game.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session this week in Saint-Etienne.\n\nHead coach Bev Priestman apologised and took no part in the game against New Zealand, feeling it would not be appropriate.\n\n\"As a Canadian, these are not our values. We are not cheats,\" said defender Vanessa Gilles, who described the episode as a \"humiliation\".\n\nas/dj\n\nMore from this section\n\niMyFone VoxBox TTS Voice AI Launches Video Dubbing

She shook things up a bit with her Olympic roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nPeople are also reading...

U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on Hayes' Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn't able to play in France because of minor knee irritation.\n\nIt was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage.\n\nWhile Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through.\n\nBanda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, Banda had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage.\n\nCanada 2, New Zealand 1\n\nEvelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at the Ferns' practice.\n\nViens, who came into the match as a substitute in the 67th, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post 12 minutes after entering.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead with a goal in the 13th minute, but Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start when two Canada staffers were sent home early for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand's practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without coach Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for the match to show accountability. However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nGermany 3, Australia 0\n\nAfter its humbling group-stage exit from the Women's World Cup last year, Germany got off to a flying start at the Olympics by beating Australia in Marseille.\n\nMarina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corners in either half and Jule Brand fired in a third for the No. 4-ranked Germans from close range.\n\nWorld Cup semifinalist Australia lacked firepower without talismanic striker Sam Kerr, who is recovering from ACL damage.\n\nHegering's far post header gave Germany the lead in the 24th and Schueller rose highest to convert a second in the 64th.\n\nBrand had a simple finish from close range after Sarai Linder's low cross to the far post in the 68th.\n\nBrazil 1, Nigeria 0\n\nGabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute and Brazil went on to defeat Nigeria in Group C in Bordeaux.\n\nMarta, a six-time world player of the year, started for Brazil in her sixth Olympics. The 38-year-old captain has said this will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\nBrazil's players were looking to send Marta off with a title in a major championship, something that has eluded her. Brazil has never won a gold medal in the Olympics but claimed silver in 2004 and 2008.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

However, she was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\nFIFA has opened a disciplinary inquiry into the matter, and Canadian Soccer launched an independent review.\n\nThe drone scandal marred the tournament's start. Canada won bronze medals in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics before winning a gold in Tokyo.\n\nNew Zealand announced a day before the match that captain Ali Riley could not play in the Olympics because of an unspecified injury.\n\nJayde Riviere of Canada was ruled unavailable earlier Thursday because of an ankle injury. Shelina Zadorsky replaced her on the roster for the match.\n\nThe Ferns, playing under interim coach Michael Mayne, were making their fifth straight Olympic appearance. New Zealand's coach, Jitka Klimkova, decided to step aside for the Olympics in late June after an independent workplace employment investigation.\n\nKlimkova was cleared in the investigation, but she did not feel there was enough time to heal the environment before the tournament.\n\nSpain 2, Japan 1\n\nWorld champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th.\n\nSpain might have had flashbacks to its 4-0 loss to Japan at last year's World Cup, but Bonmati -- who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months -- leveled the game nine minutes later when rounding goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nShe provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"},

Meanwhile, the United States secured a 3-0 victory over Zambia.\n\nSpain, making their Olympic women's football debut, are strong contenders for gold after their World Cup triumph. Despite falling behind to Aoba Fujino's early free-kick in Nantes, Bonmati equalized by rounding the goalkeeper midway through the first half. Mariona Caldentey then netted the winner in the 74th minute after a one-two with Bonmati.\n\nWith 12 teams split into three groups, the top two teams and the best two third-placed teams advance to the quarter-finals, giving Japan some hope despite the loss. Spain's starting XI featured seven players from last year's World Cup final win over England, along with two-time former Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas.\n\nIn the same group, Brazil defeated Nigeria 1-0 in Bordeaux. Marta, competing in her sixth Olympics at 38, had a goal disallowed for offside before setting up Gabi Nunes for the winner late in the first half.\n\nIn Nice, the USA, under new coach Emma Hayes, comfortably beat Zambia 3-0 but missed numerous chances. Trinity Rodman, daughter of NBA legend Dennis Rodman, opened the scoring, and Mallory Swanson added two quick goals. Zambia's Pauline Zulu was sent off before halftime, but the USA couldn't capitalize further.\n\nElsewhere in Group B, Germany outclassed Australia, winning 3-0 in Marseille with goals from Marina Hegering, Lea Schueller, and Jule Brand. The USA and Germany will face each other in Marseille on Sunday.\n\nIn Group A, host nation France survived a scare to beat Colombia 3-2 in Lyon. Marie-Antoinette Katoto scored twice and Kenza Dali added another as France seemed to cruise, but Colombia fought back with goals from Catalina Usme and Manuela Pavi. A red card for Mayra Ramirez dashed Colombia's hopes.\n\nReigning Olympic champions Canada overcame a spying scandal to beat New Zealand 2-1 in Saint-Etienne. Mackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the lead, but Cloe Lacasse equalized, and Evelyne Viens scored the winner. Canada's preparation was marred by an incident involving an assistant coach and an analyst using a drone to spy on New Zealand's training, leading to their dismissal from the team.\n\nCanada's head coach Bev Priestman apologized and did not attend the match. Defender Vanessa Gilles called the incident a \"humiliation\" and emphasized that \"these are not our values.\"\n\nThe Olympic football tournament continues, with teams vying for advancement and

Olympic debutants Spain recovered from going behind to an early goal to avenge a 4-0 group stage loss to the Asians in last year's World Cup, which they went on to win.\n\nJapan opened the scoring in the 13th minute when Aoba Fujino's superb free kick sailed into the top right corner, with goalkeeper Cata Coll only managing to get a finger to it. Ballon d'Or winner Bonmati equalized for Spain only nine minutes later with an easy finish off a through ball by Athenea del Castillo after they cut through Japan's defense.\n\nSpain dominated possession in the second half and took the lead in the 74th minute courtesy of a Mariona Caldentey strike following a Bonmati pass to go top of the group. \"We have started the Games very well. I'm happy for the win. (The World Cup loss against) Japan left us with a thorn in our side,\" Bonmati said.\n\n\"The goal we conceded didn't change our mentality. We played our football and we deserved the win.\" Elsewhere, reigning Olympic champions Canada also claimed a 2-1 comeback victory over New Zealand in St Etienne in the first day of action in Group A.\n\nGermany made a strong start to the tournament in Marseille with a 3-0 win over Australia in the opening Group B match, thanks to goals from Marina Hegering, Lea Schueller, and Jule Brand. Hegering's towering header from a corner broke the deadlock in the 24th minute before Schueller netted in similar fashion in the 64th. Jule Brand made it 3-0 with a simple finish four minutes later to seal the win for the 2016 Olympic champions.\n\nIn the second match in Group C, Brazil earned a 1-0 win over Nigeria in Bordeaux. Gabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute following a pass from Brazil's all-time leading scorer Marta, who is playing at her sixth Olympics. Four-time gold medallists United States will take on Zambia, while France faces Colombia in the final matches of the day.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, the USA could not add any more goals with the extra player.\n\nAlso in Group B, 2016 gold medallists Germany outclassed Australia, winning 3-0 in Marseille with Marina Hegering and Lea Schueller both scoring headers before Jule Brand wrapped up the victory.\n\nThe USA and Germany meet each other in Marseille on Sunday.\n\n- Canada shrug off spying scandal -\n\nFrance survived a wobble to beat Colombia 3-2 in Lyon, where there were plenty of empty seats to greet the host nation.\n\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto scored twice in the first half either side of a Kenza Dali strike as France appeared to be cruising.\n\nHowever, Catalina Usme pulled one back from a penalty early in the second half and substitute Manuela Pavi further reduced the deficit before a red card for Mayra Ramirez ended Colombian hopes of snatching a point.\n\nIn the same Group A, reigning Olympic champions Canada shrugged off a spying scandal to claim a 2-1 win over New Zealand in Saint-Etienne.\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the lead before a sparse crowd at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.\n\nArsenal's Cloe Lacasse levelled in first-half stoppage time for Canada, who beat Sweden on penalties in the final in Tokyo three years ago. Evelyne Viens then fired in the winner 11 minutes from time.\n\nCanada's build-up had been overshadowed after an assistant coach and an analyst were sent home from the Olympics on the eve of the game.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session this week in Saint-Etienne.\n\nHead coach Bev Priestman apologised and took no part in the game against New Zealand, feeling it would not be appropriate.\n\n\"As a Canadian, these are not our values. We are not cheats,\" said defender Vanessa Gilles, who described the episode as a \"humiliation\".\n\nas/dj\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Julio Cortez/Asssociated Press\n\nNICE, France -- Mallory Swanson scored a pair of goals just moments apart in the first half and the United States opened the Olympics with a 3-0 victory over Zambia on Thursday night, giving new coach Emma Hayes a win in her first major tournament with the team.\n\nTrinity Rodman also scored for the United States, which is looking to add a record fifth gold medal to its Olympic collection.\n\nZambia was hurt in the 33rd minute when Pauline Zulu was sent off with a red card and the team was limited to 10 players the rest of the way. Zulu sobbed as she left the field.\n\nHayes took over the U.S. team in late May after finishing out the season with Chelsea in the Women's Super League. She shook things up a bit with her roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home.\n\nHayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer's Women's World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16.\n\nRodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice.\n\nU.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game because of what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams.\n\nWilliams was originally an alternate on the Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario isn't able to play in France because of a knee injury.\n\nIn other games:\n\n* Evelyne Viens scored in the 79th minute to give reigning Olympic champion Canada a 2-1 victory over New Zealand in a match that was overshadowed by allegations of drone surveillance at New Zealand practices.\n\nViens, who entered as a substitute in the 67th minute, took a long pass from Jessie Fleming and tucked it into the goal at the opposite post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMackenzie Barry gave New Zealand the early lead in the 13th minute. Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Group A match in Saint-Etienne was controversial before the start. Two Canada staffers were sent home for their alleged involvement with drones that were reported over a pair of New Zealand practices.\n\nCanada played the opener without its head coach, Bev Priestman, who stepped away from the team for one match. She was adamant at practice Wednesday that she had no knowledge of the drone use.\n\n* World champion Spain came from behind to beat Japan in Group C, thanks to a goal and an assist from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati.\n\nPlaying in its first Olympics, Spain fell behind at La Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes after Aoba Fumino's brilliant long range free kick flew into the top corner in the 13th minute.\n\nBonmati, who has dominated the individual awards in women's soccer over the past 12 months, leveled the game nine minutes later, then provided the assist for Mariona Caldentey to score the winner in the 74th with a curling shot into the bottom corner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* Marina Hegering and Lea Schueller scored headers from corner kicks, and Jule Brand fired in a third goal for fourth-ranked Germany in a 3-0 win over Australia in Marseille.\n\n* Gabi Nunes scored in the 37th minute as Brazil defeated Nigeria, 1-0, in Bordeaux.\n\n* Marie-Antoinette Katoto scored a pair of goals and Kenza Dali added another as France built a 3-0 lead in the first half and held on for a 3-2 win over Colombia in Lyon.\n\nTENNIS: Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic could meet in the second round of the men's singles tournament - which might end up being the last event of Nadal's career.\n\nDjokovic was drawn Thursday against Australian Matthew Ebden in the first round, and Nadal faces Hungarian Marton Fucsovics, with the winners of those matches meeting next. The tennis competition begins Saturday at Roland Garros.\n\nTop-ranked Iga Swiatek of Poland faces Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania in the first round of the women's draw, with second-seeded American Coco Gauff taking on Australian Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour-time major winner Naomi Osaka of Japan will play three-time major champion Angelique Kerber of Germany. Kerber, 36, announced Thursday's that she'll retire after the Olympics.\n\n* Two-time men's singles gold medalist Andy Murray pulled out of the singles tournament before Thursday's draw and only will compete in doubles with Dan Evans.\n\nMurray, a 37-year-old from Britain, has said these Olympics will be the final event of his career.\n\nFIGURE SKATING: The U.S. figure skating team was formally confirmed as gold medalists from the 2022 Beijing Olympics by a sports court ruling Thursday, opening the way for the team to get its medals in Paris.\n\nIt is now nearly 2 1/2 years and multiple layers of Court of Arbitration for Sport appeals since the American skaters left the Beijing Games without a medal of any color.\n\nThey placed second in the team event to a Russian team that included teenage star Kamila Valieva, who within hours was implicated in a doping case that took almost two years to judge.\n\nNow, Evan Bates, Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Madison Chock, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell, Alexa Knierim and Vincent Zhou will be recognized as official Olympic champions.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.", "source": {"uri":

Lindsey Horan assisted Rodman, who quickly changed direction to spin and beat goalkeeper Ngambo Musole.\n\n\"I think in that situation I knew that if I took a touch in front of me, it probably would've put me out of the frame of the goal,\" Rodman said. \"I was trying to just put her off balance, which worked, so I'm happy about that.\"\n\nZambia were reduced to 10 players at the half-hour mark after a red card for Pauline Zulu, who left the pitch in tears. She was penalized for a foul that halted Sophia Smith from scoring a would-be goal.\n\nCoach Emma Hayes was thrilled with the early effort and focus in her debut as the USWNT coach in major tournament play, but felt the opportunity to put the game away was there in the first half.\n\n\"The first part of the first half was exceptional -- to come out the way we did -- the intention, the intensity, the decision making, the execution,\" Hayes said. \"It should have been at least five at halftime.\"\n\nOlympic debutants Spain recovered from going behind to an early goal in Nantes and beat Group C rivals Japan to avenge a 4-0 group stage loss to the Asians in last year's World Cup, which they went on to win.\n\nAoba Fujino's superb free kick opened the scoring for Japan, but Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati equalized for only nine minutes later with an easy finish.\n\nSpain dominated possession in the second half and sealed the win in the 74th minute courtesy of a Mariona Caldentey strike following a Bonmati pass to go top of the group.\n\n\"We have started the Games very well. I'm happy for the win. (The World Cup loss against) Japan left us with a thorn in our side,\" Bonmati said.\n\n\"The goal we conceded didn't change our mentality. We played our football and we deserved the win.\"\n\nElsewhere, reigning Olympic champions Canada also claimed a 2-1 comeback victory over New Zealand in St Etienne in the first day of action in Group A.\n\nFrance's Marie-Antoinette Katoto struck twice to help the hosts to a 3-2 win over Colombia in their Group A opener in Lyon.\n\nKatoto opened the scoring after six minutes, pouncing on a misplaced pass by Linda Caicedo.\n\nKenza Dali doubled the lead in the 18th minute before Katoto got her second and made it 3-0 with a header three minutes before half-time.\n\nColombia's Catalina Usme and Manuela Pavi then made it 3-2 scoring in the 54th and 64th minutes, respectively.\n\nBut their hopes of a comeback and a first Olympic win were dashed when Mayra Ramirez was shown a red card five minutes from time.\n\nGermany made a strong start to the tournament in Marseille with a 3-0 win over Australia in Group B match, thanks to goals from Marina Hegering, Lea Schueller and Jule Brand.\n\nTowering headers from Hegering in the 24th and Schueller in the 64th, as well as a Brand effort sealed the rout for the 2016 Olympic champions.\n\nBrazil earned a 1-0 win over Nigeria in Bordeaux in Group C.

Katoto struck again in the 42nd minute to put France 3-0 ahead.\n\nColombia fought back after the break and won a penalty kick, which was converted by Catalina Usme in the 54th minute.\n\nThen Manuela Pavi's goal in the 64th minute reduced France's lead to 3-2. But the hosts regrouped and held onto their lead to the finish.\n\nIn an earlier kick-off, reigning women's World Cup holders Spain had to work hard and come from behind against a spirited Japan to win their first ever football game at Olympic Games.\n\nGoals from Aitana Bonmati and Mariona Caldentey turned the match around 2-1 for the side who have to be considered gold medal favorites, despite a tough group that also contains Nigeria and Brazil.\n\nJapan are one of the last teams to have beaten Spain, defeating them in the group stage in last year's World Cup, after the Spanish had already assured a place in the next phase.\n\nThey showed themselves to be feisty rivals again, taking the lead with a wonder-goal after 13 minutes through a free kick from Aoba Fujino.\n\nCanada also had to come back from one goal down to beat New Zealand. New Zealand scored in the 13th minute through Mackenzie Barry who made a superb turn in the box to finish a cross from Katie Kitching.\n\nIn the injury time of the first half, Cloe Lacasse equalized for Canada after she outpaced the opposition defenders to find the net.\n\nEvelyne Viens wrapped up the win for the defending champions in the 79th minute when she picked up a long pass from Jessie Fleming and scored with a one-touch shot.\n\nElsewhere, the United States and Germany both cruised to 3-0 win respectively over Zambia and Australia.\n\nBrazil beat Nigeria 1-0. Nunes Gabi scored the sole goal of the match assisted by Marta, who was playing at her sixth and final Olympic Games. The 38-year-old planned to retire from the national team after the Paris Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They will look to reclaim gold with Russia ineligible to take part in team sports.\n\nBiles is looking to complete her comeback after withdrawing from competition during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

In the 12-team tournament, the top two teams from the three groups, along with two best third-placed sides, will reach the quarterfinals.\n\n\"We only have two days to rest before the next game and have no time to drop our heads,\" Kumagai said. \"We'll look to get points there at any cost as we try to do everything possible to make the knockout stage.\"\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nOlympics: Japan

How did they get on in their first group stage matches?", "body": "In Group A, Lawrence and Buchanan - who was making her 150th appearance - started as Canada began the defence of their gold medal with a 2-1 win over New Zealand in Saint-Etienne.\n\nThe Blues duo found themselves 1-0 down when the Football Ferns took the lead after only 13 minutes, however, the game was level at the break with Canada equalising on the stroke of half-time.\n\nLawrence helped set up the leveler with our defender playing a smart one-two with former Chelsea midfielder Jessie Fleming, before the former released the ball to Nichelle Prince, who found goal scorer Cloe Lacasse.\n\nCanada completed the comeback in the 79th minute when Fleming played a sweeping through pass forward to Evelyne Viens, who buried the ball into the bottom corner from a tight angle inside the box.\n\nFrench duo Baltimore and Perisset, who were both named on the bench, claimed bragging rights in the battle of the Blues in the other Group A clash as the Olympic hosts beat Mayra Ramirez's Colombia 3-2 in Lyon.\n\nThree first-half goals from Marie-Antoinette Katoto (2) and Kenza Dali had France in control at the interval.\n\nHowever, it was a more even second half. Chelsea striker Ramirez won a penalty in the 52nd minute after being brought down by French goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin. Catalina Usme converted the spot-kick and pulled a goal back for Colombia, before substitute Manuela Pavi made it 3-2 soon after.\n\nIn the 70th minute, Baltimore came on from France as part of a double change. But, as one Blue entered the pitch, one would soon leave it as Ramirez was shown a straight red card following a VAR review for a challenge on Selma Bacha.\n\nThe results in Group A have France sitting at the top with three points, Canada in second, Colombia in third and New Zealand in fourth.\n\nIn Marseille, Nusken made her Olympics debut as she started and played the first-half for Germany in their Group B opening win against Australia.\n\nThe Germans took the lead after 24 minutes, with Marina Hegering finding the back of the net with a header. Two quickfire goals just after the hour mark, from Lea Schuller and Jule Brand, saw Germany claim a 3-0 victory.\n\nAfter one game, Nusken and her compatriots are top of Group B, level on points with the USA who beat Zambia 3-0 in their first competitive fixture under former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes. The Matildas are third, while Zambia sit bottom.\n\nIn Group C, Hamano was named on the substitutes bench for Japan as they took on reigning world champions Spain in Nantes.\n\nOur forward was introduced at half-time with the score level at 1-1. Japan had taken the lead through Aoba Fujino after 13 minutes, before Aitana Bonmati equalised for Spain less than 10 minutes later.\n\nIt would finish 2-1 to Spain after Mariona Caldentey put them ahead with a strike inside the box in the 74th minute.\n\nThe defeat leaves Japan sitting third in their group, level on zero points with fourth-placed Nigeria, who were defeated 1-0 by Brazil. Spain are first and Brazil are second, both with three points.", "source": {"uri": "chelseafc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chelsea Football Club"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The midfielder received the ball on the edge of the Japan area and showed quick feet to slip the across goal and into the net.\n\nSpain then pinned their rivals back into their own half, but failed to find a way though before the break.\n\nSalma Paralluelo went close on a couple of occasions, but the former 400-meter runner, was crowed out on both occasions, and despite Spain's dominance, Japan defended solidly until the 74th minute, when Caldentey received the ball on the corner of the area and beat two defenders before curling in a shot that went in off the inside of the post.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nantes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nantes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoba_Fujino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aoba Fujino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitana_Bonmat\u00ed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aitana Bonmat\u00ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cata_Coll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cata Coll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariona_Caldentey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mariona Caldentey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salma_Paralluelo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salma Paralluelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763937", "eventUri": "eng-9763937", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nantes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

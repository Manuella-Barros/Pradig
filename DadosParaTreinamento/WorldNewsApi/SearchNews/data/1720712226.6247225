I'm going to share more videos of Brady acting human.\"In the comments, viewers reacted to the unusual dog position with shock and amusement.\"Why did this scare me?\" asked Ell Hemingway. While Emily agreed and said: \"Genuinely horrified I would never look at him the same.\"Emma Louise Wiggins said: \"My goldendoodle does this too. Why do they have knees?\"J.scroll3.0 dubbed Brady a \"fully conscious puppy,\" while GD said: \"My husband and I always joke that goldendoodles have little human souls trapped in them because of their eyes but seeing this makes it kind of too real and scary now.\"While Brady's sitting position may look a little scary, dogs sitting like this isn't that unusual.According to Wag! Walking, this behavior is linked to breed variety and anatomical preferences. Dogs like Great Danes and other breeds with long hind legs often sit in unusual positions for comfort, particularly to alleviate stress on their hips or backs.\"Though the human-like posture doesn't exactly look comfortable on a dog, it is believed that the position offers some relief to hip or back stress, typically by supporting the lumbar region and centering the weight of a dog's chest over the rest of the body,\" Wag! Walking said. \"It has been found to be slightly more common in dogs with hip problems such as hip dysplasia... If you notice your dog moving stiffly or having difficulty getting up and down, you might want to schedule a visit with your veterinarian.\"Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?

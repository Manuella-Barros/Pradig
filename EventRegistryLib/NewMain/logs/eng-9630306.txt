As per the sources, discussions will be held on government formation by the grand alliance.\n\nThis comes after the NDA crossed the majority mark bagging 293 seats in the Lok Sabha polls. However, the BJP managed to secure only 240 seats, much lower than its 2019 tally. Earlier on Wednesday, leaders of parties in the NDA held a meeting and elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi as their leader.\n\nMeanwhile, Narendra Modi is likely to take oath as the Prime Minister for the third consecutive time on June 9, according to sources. Earlier there was speculation that the swearing-in ceremony of the new NDA government led by PM Modi would take place on Saturday. However, there is no official confirmation yet of the date of the oath-taking ceremony.\n\nAs per the results announced by the Election Commission of India on Tuesday, the BJP won 240 seats and along with its allies, it stands at 293 seats. Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JDU, having won 16 and 12 seats respectively in their respective states, have extended support to the NDA. The INDIA bloc has 234 MPs in the new parliament with the Congress having won 99 seats.

However, can it afford to accept all the demands that have been made by the TDP and JD(U) for staying in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)? And what does this mean in terms of future governance?\n\nEarlier, media reports stated that TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu sought ministerial berths for Information Technology, Communications, Home Ministry and Minister of State for Finance aside from other departments like Road Transport, Rural Development, Health, Housing and Urban Affairs, Jal Shakti, Agriculture, Education.\n\nThe TDP's demand for the IT ministry is not surprising considering Naidu's history. He is credited with commissioning HITEC City and Genome Valley in 1998, adjoining Cyberabad to the west of Hyderabad, propelling the information technology industry. Many also credit him for enabling the tech and IT sector in Andhra Pradesh. According to Nikhil Pahwa, Founder and Editor at MediaNama:\n\n\"Naidu has been amongst the first to deploy and encourage the setting up of tech companies in the country and also deployment of technology in governance. From that sense, I don't see the tech focus of the government shifting at all. If anything, it may even get enhanced if TDP takes over. The other aspect to consider here is that the TDP has historically been the architect of what one may call a surveillance state in Andhra Pradesh. If there were concerns about linking Aadhaar to everything, about databases getting created and new IDs that are linked backwards to Aadhaar, the rollout of surveillance tech like facial recognition, CCTVs, etc.; all of that is likely to remain the same, if not increase, if the TDP is involved in the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Essentially, Mr. Naidu and the government that has followed his [government] have in Andhra/Telangana, have basically used technology to exercise control, and that is likely to continue with the TDP having an impact on tech policy at the Centre now.\"\n\nAside from Naidu, JD(U) has also put forth its demand for Railways, Rural Development, Water Resources and a Minister of State position as these ministries would help the party in their home state, reported the Hindustan Times. Weighing in on what this means for future governance, Pahwa said:\n\n\"The sense that we've got in the past is that most of the directions for laws, bills, rules, processes were coming from either the Prime Minister's Office [PMO], and in some cases from Home Ministry. This is the sense that we've got. Most ministers often had to defend decisions that were being taken by the Prime Minister's office. It's not that they weren't involved in it, but largely the power lay with the Prime Minister's office. Now, with the TDP and the JD(U) getting ministries, I think it's important to understand that their ministries are likely to be independent of the PMO. This could lead to a more consultative process and more engagement in parliament. On the whole, this is good for the democratic functioning of the government, where we've seen a bit of backsliding in the past.\"\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSTAY ON TOP OF TECH NEWS: Our daily newsletter with the top story of the day from MediaNama, delivered to your inbox before 9 AM.

The buzz in Andhra Pradesh political circles considered close to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is that he is demanding the post of Speaker, apart from six ministerial posts for his flock of 18 MPs which includes two from Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena.\n\nThe portfolios he is seeking are Finance, Water Resources, Urban development, Industry and Health. Naidu is also reported to be seeking the fulfilment of Centre's promise on Special Category status of AP.\n\nThat would be a minimum of six prime posts for a flock of 18 MPs - 16 of TDP and 2 of JNP, but given the precarious position of the BJP was short of 32 for majority, it needs support of every MP that it can get. The support of MPs elected on TDP-JNP ticket is more critical than the 12 from Nitish Kumar-led JDU in Bihar.\n\nNaidu's insistence on the ministries are born out of his determination to ensure that the long-pending promise of Central assistance through Special Category status to AP for losing cash cow Hyderabad to Telangana, and funding for completing the mega irrigation project of Polavaram. That is why the insistence on Finance. Also known to be industry-friendly, he wants the Industry ministry for AP in order to drive investment towards his state. The insistence on Urban Development is to ensure that the centre invests in developing Amaravathi as the state capital.\n\nNaidu's demands for his state have financial implications for the Centre in the vicinity of Rs 50,000 crore or more.\n\nThe TDP supremo is also said to have demanded Rural Development and Health. But these are more likely to be bargaining chips, rather than non-negotiable demands.\n\nBut what is interesting is his insistence on TDP getting the Speaker's chair. According to the buzz in TDP circles, this is to ensure that the BJP cannot at some point of time break the TDP group in the Lok Sabha to increase number of its own flock. Naidu, according to TDP circles, is very wary of the BJP \"doing an Eknath Shinde or Ajit Pawar on him\".\n\nThe TDP boss is understandably bitter with the BJP since it inducted two of his most trusted lieutenants. Sujana Chowdhary and CM Ramesh, both members of Rajya Sabha, who defected from TDP in June 2019. The BJP did so, embittered with Naidu's decision to break the alliance.\n\nBut according to TDP sources, Naidu has continued to nurse his bitterness towards Amit Shah, who he had blamed for breaking away from TDP Chowdhary and Ramesh, both very affluent businessmen, known to have funded the Telugu regional party.\n\nIn support of their contention, TDP sources point to two old video clips currently going viral on social media in Andhra Pradesh. One is of Naidu speaking with a TV channel on February 11, 2019 in which he accuses BJP of using central agencies to stifle Opposition, a year after he broke a state level alliance with the party, accusing it of breaking its promise to accord Special Category status.\n\nThe other is of Amit Shah launching a bitter attack on Naidu after the latter broke the alliance. Shah is heard saying: \"There is no more opportunistic leader like Chandrababu Naidu in the entire history of India.\" He goes on to accuse Naidu of stabbing NTR in the back to become chief minister, joining the BJP for political gains, and leaving it when it was found convenient. Sha goes on to declare: \"Chandrababu Naidu, the doors of NDA are closed to you forever.\"\n\nFive years is a long period in politics, and both Naidu and BJP have set aside their pet peeves and decided to enable the forming of the Modi 3.0 government at the Centre. But apparently, Naidu's animus for Shah has not abated. He is said to have insisted that Amit Shah should not hold the Home portfolio, and has demanded that either TDP or JDU should be given the ministry, or that anybody other than Shah be given the responsibility to make the TDP feel more secure.\n\nBut aware that his demand for the Home ministry being rejected by the BJP, Naidu is demanding the Speaker's post, in order to keep his flock together. According to the Constitution, the Speaker is the \"custodian\" of the House, and after a long drawn-out battle in the Supreme Court over the supremacy of Parliament, and the powers of the Speaker to decide on the validity of defections, the 1985 anti-defection law was placed in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, taking it out of the purview of judicial scrutiny.\n\nThat is why, Naidu, being a seasoned politician, and fearful of his political power being undermined, now wants the Speaker's post for his party.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kv_ramesh@news9live.com", "name": "Kv Ramesh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Chandrababu_Naidu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "N.

Know Why It Is Important", "body": "New Delhi: As the BJP-led NDA brainstorms over the power-sharing module ahead of the formation of the government, the allies have put forward their demands to the BJP. NDA ally Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has demanded the Lok Sabha speaker's post from the BJP. NDA is all set to form government once again for the third consecutive term. In NDA, the BJP is the single largest party and with other alliance partners, it has managed to secure 292 Lok Sabha seats. As per ECI data, the TDP won 16 parliamentary seats.\n\nThe TDP has also demanded 3 cabinet ministers' posts, the NDA is yet to take a final call on this. The JDU has also demanded 3 cabinet ministers and one MOS post from the BJP. However, the focus is on the post of the Lok Sabha speaker.\n\nWhy TDP Wants Lok Sabha Speaker Post?\n\nThe Lok Sabha speaker post was traditionally held by the BJP, who was ruling at the centre. Reportedly, TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu verbally convened that they want the Lok Sabha speaker post. TDP sources said this has been done because Naidu is aware of the importance of the Speaker's post, especially when the government is facing a tight no-confidence motion on the floor of the House.\n\nIn 1998, Naidu offered his support to Atal Bihari Vajpayee to the NDA government. He didn't ask for any cabinet posts but asked for a Speaker's post and nominated GMC Balayogi for the post.\n\nThe Lok Sabha speaker is the head and principal of the spokesperson of the house. The role of the speaker is to maintain order and decorum in the house and also allow to adjourn or suspend the proceedings of the house in case of an absence of decorum.\n\nThe speaker's post is also important because even if the government collapses, the speaker cannot be removed until the house is dissolved. So, if the TDP gets the speaker's post and switches sides with the Congress, then the speaker will continue to hold the post. The House can remove the Speaker only through a resolution passed by an effective majority which means more than 50% of the total strength of the house.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_Desam_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telugu Desam Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(United)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (United)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atal Bihari Vajpayee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Electronics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Audio", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Audio", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/06/06/1412785-tdpwantspeakerpost-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630306", "eventUri": "eng-9630306", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

As the NDA's largest constituent after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the TDP's leverage is significant, and its demands reflect a calculated effort to maximize its influence within the coalition.\n\nCentral to the TDP's demands is the post of Speaker of the Lok Sabha, a role traditionally held by the ruling party. This request, although not formally presented in the recent NDA meeting, signals the TDP's awareness of the Speaker's critical role in parliamentary proceedings. The party's historical perspective is telling: In 1998, TDP leader N Chandrababu Naidu's strategic nomination of GMC Balayogi for the Speaker's post was instrumental during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure. The Speaker's influence became evident in 1999 when Balayogi's guidance led to the downfall of the Vajpayee government, illustrating the position's potential impact.\n\nAdditionally, the TDP has demanded special status for Andhra Pradesh, a long-standing issue since the bifurcation of the state in 2014. If special status is unattainable, the TDP insists on a substantial special package, focusing on critical projects like the Polavaram irrigation project. This emphasis on development highlights the party's commitment to addressing regional disparities and fulfilling electoral promises.\n\nWhile TDP senior leader Deepak Reddy has publicly stated that the party is prioritizing state development over ministerial positions, insiders reveal a more nuanced stance. The TDP is reportedly seeking four to five ministerial berths, including two cabinet positions. This dual strategy of public modesty and private negotiation exemplifies the party's tactical approach to securing both political influence and developmental benefits for Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn parallel, the Janata Dal (United) or JDU, another key NDA ally, is vying for control of the Agriculture and Railways Ministries. This underscores a broader trend within the alliance, where regional parties are leveraging their support to extract significant concessions from the central leadership.\n\nThe TDP's current maneuvering within the NDA framework is not merely about accruing power but also about securing tangible benefits for Andhra Pradesh. As the political dynamics evolve, the TDP's demands could significantly shape the alliance's future, highlighting the delicate balance between regional aspirations and national politics.", "source": {"uri": "siasat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Siasat Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_Desam_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telugu Desam Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh_Reorganisation_Act,_2014", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atal Bihari Vajpayee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Chandrababu_Naidu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N.

Sources said the new government is likely to be sworn in on Sunday, although no formal communication to this effect had been issued by the Rashtrapati Bhawan.\n\nChief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar along with two Election Commissioners submitted the full list of Lok Sabha winners to the President Droupadi Murmu, bringing to an end the period of Model Code of Conduct.\n\nA meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party is expected to be held on Friday morning during which the newly-elected MPs will elect their new leader, sources said. This is likely to be followed by a meeting of the NDA MPs. Most of the NDA leaders are already in Delhi whereas TDP supremo and Chief Minister-elect of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu and Jana Sena Party leader Pawan Kalyan were expected to fly back to the Capital on Thursday evening.\n\nAlso read: NDA elects Modi as leader, President dissolves Lok Sabha Naidu's priority\n\nA top BJP source told businessline that Chandrababu Naidu's priority is to build a capital city - Amaravathi and Vijayawada - for Andhra Pradesh and focus on infrastructure development as also to carry forward the populist and welfarist schemes of his predecessor which have left the state finances in doldrums. \"He wants funds on a large scale. Of course, he would want plum portfolios too but nothing that we cannot accommodate,\" the BJP source said.\n\nTDP had held the post of the Speaker in the earlier NDA government under former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee's leadership. TDP MP G.M.C. Balayogi was Speaker of the Lok Sabha during Vajpayee's tenure. The JD(U) already holds the post of the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.\n\nMeanwhile, insiders in TDP said that Naidu could negotiate for 3 to 5 key berths in the Union Cabinet. Naidu held a brainstorming session with his newly-elected MPs on issues pertaining to government formation at the Centre in Amaravathi.\n\nAlso read: PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony likely to take place on June 9 Nitish's negotiation\n\nSo far as JD(U) is concerned, the priority for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is to negotiate a financial package for Bihar. \"He would also not like to see anyone from his party getting a big portfolio and acquire a national prominence that overshadows him. He will negotiate for portfolios, but I doubt if he is going to make a pitch for Finance or MEA,\" said a top BJP source.\n\nThe JD(U), however, flagged the issue of Agniveer scheme and caste census. \"There is anger among voters on the (short-term army recruitment) Agniveer scheme. Our party wants those shortcomings to be removed, on which people have objections,\" said senior JD(U) leader K. C. Tyagi.\n\nAnother NDA ally, Chirag Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party, too said he is in favour of a review of the Agniveer scheme and a nationwide caste census.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 6, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Chandrababu_Naidu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "N.

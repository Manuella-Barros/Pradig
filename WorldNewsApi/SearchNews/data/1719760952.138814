{"id": 225050186, "title": "Jon Anderson Is Playing Seventies Yes Classics Again \u2014 With a Band He Found on YouTube", "text": "In the summer of 2018, Richie Castellano and his buddies posted a remarkable cover of the 1972 Yes epic \u201cClose to the Edge\u201d to their YouTube channel and watched it rack up over half a million views. \u201cI\u2019m blown away by these comments,\u201d he wrote in response to the outpouring of love by prog fans. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a bunch of music snobs showing off. This is genuine love for Yes and their music. We are hardcore Yes fans and this video is not about conquering a song or doing it better than anyone. It\u2019s about the joy of indulging our inner teenagers and being lucky enough to get the opportunity to play our favorite music.\u201d Castellano has been a multi-instrumentalist in Blue \u00d6yster Cult for the past two decades, and videos like \u201cClose to the Edge\u201d were just a fun way for him to spend time between commitments to the group. But one of the half million people to see the video was Yes lead singer Jon Anderson, right around the time he was in need of a new band. \u201cThey were quite amazing and they looked happy and fun,\u201d Anderson tells Rolling Stone. \u201cI phoned up Richie the bass player and said, \u2018Let\u2019s go on tour.\u2019 And he said, \u2018What?'\u201d The tour wasn\u2019t able to take place until 2023 due to Covid and Anderson\u2019s other obligations, but it was worth the wait. Under the banner \u201cYes \u2013 Epics & Classics Featuring Jon Anderson and The Band Geeks,\u201d they delivered a night of Seventies prog masterpieces like \u201cHeart of the Sunrise,\u201d \u201cYours Is No Disgrace,\u201d and \u201cAwaken\u201d played to absolute perfection. And when it wrapped up, they funneled their energy into a new album, True, that they plan on releasing later this year. \u201cI can\u2019t even wrap my head around all this,\u201d says Castellano. \u201cI used to go watch Jon in concert and scream at him. Getting to do something like this is just a dream. It\u2019s also been opportunity as a Yes fan to go, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ve been handed the keys to the kingdom. We have Jon Anderson singing for us. How do we want this to go?\u201d\u2018 Castellano learned about the kingdom of Yes at age 14 when his uncle Phil handed him a copy of Fragile. \u201cHe challenged me to learn \u2018Heart of the Sunrise,'\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so I tried it and then I realized, \u2018Oh, this is way beyond me musically. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening here.\u2019 Once I learned how to do it, I was converted. I was a fan.\u201d He first saw Yes when the Talk tour came to the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey, on Sept. 7, 1994. \u201cAs a young guitar player, Trevor Rabin just melted my face,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably saw them seven or eight times after that. I converted all my friends.\u201d Castellano got a job with Blue \u00d6yster Cult as a sound engineer when he was done with his schooling, which led to occasional opportunities to guest with them at gigs. When bassist Danny Miranda let the band in 2004, they offered Castellano his spot. Three years later, when journeyman bassist Rudy Sarzo joined the group, Castellano took on a new rule as a keyboardist, rhythm guitarist, and backing vocalist. Sarzo has played with everyone from Ozzy Osbourne and Quiet Riot to Whitesnake, Geoff Tate\u2019s Queensr\u00ffche, and the Guess Who. Castellano was in awe of him. They were in the back of the tour van one day when Sarzo asked him if he had his own YouTube channel. He didn\u2019t. \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019re making a big mistake,'\u201d says Castellano. \u2018A guy your age, if you don\u2019t have a YouTube channel, you don\u2019t exist.\u2019 I\u2019ll never forget that.\u201d With Sarzo\u2019s help, Castellano started his own YouTube channel and began posting videos, including his one-man take on Queen\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d that went viral. He also started a podcast with his musical buddies he called Band Geek. It didn\u2019t long for him to realize that people had far more interest in hearing them play music than just talk about it. \u201cWe phased the podcast out,\u201d says Castellano. \u201cAnd we became Band Geek the band.\u201d Working alongside a rotating crew of musicians, Castellano tackled songs like \u201cHere I Go Again,\u201d \u201cIn the Cage,\u201d \u201cWorking for the Weekend,\u201d and \u201cHeaven and Hell.\u201d Whenever they did a Yes song, soprano vocalist Ann Marie Nacchio joined them. Jon Anderson\u2019s webmaster came across their \u201cClose to the Edge,\u201d and put them on the phone together. \u201cI was completely a babbling idiot on the phone,\u201d says Castellano. \u201cBecause how often does your hero call you? The person you\u2019ve been idolizing since childhood. He went, \u2018You sound like Seventies Yes. Everything is just perfect.\u2019 I was just floating while he was talking. At the end, he said, \u2018We should do something.'\u201d At the time, Yes were divided into two warring camps. Guitarist Steve Howe led Yes with drummer Alan White and Drama-era keyboardist Geoff Downes, while Anderson fronted the spinoff group Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, and Rick Wakeman. For reasons that have never been fully articulated, the Anderson/Rabin/Wakeman incarnation of the group dissolved in 2018. \u201cThat band was fun,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cThere\u2019s a story there, but I won\u2019t tell it now.\u201d Whatever the story is, it ends with Anderson as a man without a band. But the instant he saw Castellano and the Band Geeks play \u201cClose to the Edge,\u201d he saw a path forward. \u201cI told Richie I wanted to go on tour,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Jon are you serious?\u2019 I said to him, \u2018Yeah, I want to play \u2018Gates of Delirium,\u2019 \u2018Close to the Edge,\u2019 \u2018Awaken\u2019 and all the hits of the Seventies. If we have to do anything like \u2018Owner [of a Lonely Heart],\u2019 we\u2019ll do it at the end. But generally speaking, I want to do the music of Yes in the Seventies, the best of it.\u201d It took a while to sort through the logistics, wait out Covid, and find a hole in the Blue \u00d6yster Cult tour schedule. There was also the matter of Castellano, keyboardist Chris Clark, keyboardist Andy Ascolese, guitarist Robert Kipp, and guitarist/bassist Andy Graziano learning every tiny nuance of these wildly complicated songs. \u201cWe did 48 rehearsals for the first tour,\u201d says Castellano. \u201cAnd that was just to get all the parts right. Jon eventually started watching us via Zoom. He\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, in this part, change this\u2019 or \u2018you sing this part with me.\u2019 He\u2019d be singing along even though it was Zoom. It was really awesome.\u201d For Castellano, the hardest part was figuring out how to play all 22 minutes of \u201cGates of Delirium.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s this one bass drum and bass guitar pattern with no repeats in it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like one long phrase you just have to memorize. If one of your readers knows what the repeat is, please send it to me because I couldn\u2019t find it. I looked at it from every angle. I eventually had to make up these little mnemonic devices and nursery rhymes just to get the part right.\u201d Most of these songs were in the Yes live repertoire for decades, which only complicated matters. \u201cOver time, songs morph, tempos change, sections get cut out,\u201d says Castellano. \u201cWhat\u2019s the right version of \u2018Close to the Edge?\u2019 They way they played it on [the 1973] live album Yessongs? Is it the way they played it in the late Seventies? How about on [the 1996 live album] Keys to Ascension or the [2000] Masterworks tour?\u2019 I eventually just said to the guys, \u2018Every way is correct. The way they played it in 2004 is just as valid as the way they played it in 1974.'\u201d Anderson insisted they used two keyboard players so they could add in the extra textures from the albums that Yes were never able to duplicate live. \u201cDuring \u2018Close to the Edge,\u2019 right before the band comes in after the pipe organ solo [during the beginning of the \u2018Seasons of Man\u2019 section], there\u2019s this pipe organ freakout going on under the Moog,\u201d says Castellano. \u201cYes couldn\u2019t do both of them live, but we can because we have another set of hands.\u201d The tour was a mere 12 shows concentrated on the East Coast. For Anderson, every night was a revelation. \u201cIt felt really exciting,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening! Everyone is just amazing. Let\u2019s go around the world!'\u201d Before that could happen, Anderson wanted to record new music with Castellano and the Band Geeks to make this something more than a rehash of the past. But that was tricky since Anderson lives in California, the Band Geeks are centered around New York, and Blue \u00d6yster Cult spends significant time on the road every year. They wound up with a system where Anderson would send them demos via e-mail, they\u2019d flesh them out as a band, and then compare notes on Zoom. \u201cIt was like the Seventies where I would suggest ideas to the guys and because they\u2019re musicians, they\u2019d get on with it,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cI can just play four chords and then I\u2019m done.\u201d (Other songs worked in the reverse order where the Band Geeks would send a piece of original music to Anderson.) A new tour begins May 30 at the State Theater in New Brunswick, New Jersey. This one is significantly longer than the 2023 run, and there\u2019s already talk of adding more shows. Anderson spoke to us shortly before rehearsals kicked off, but he said he imagined the set would be very similar to the one last year. He does plan on removing \u201cGates of Delirium\u201d to make room for two songs from the new record. \u201cI don\u2019t want to confuse anyone that thought they were going to get Yes music,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cMy dream is that we can do another tour next year and do an hour of new music and an hour of Yes music. Maybe we\u2019d mix them all together. I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Whatever happens, Anderson says he\u2019s going to stick with the Band Geeks for the foreseeable future. Castellano still has a hard time processing the whole thing. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve told me this when we started the Band Geek podcast, that we were going to end up being a band that plays with Jon Anderson, I would\u2019ve said, \u2018Fuck you,'\u201d he says. \u201cI have no idea how this morphed into this.\u201d", "summary": "The former Yes frontman discovered Richie Castellano and his buddies online and is taking them on the road to revive prog epics from the band's heyday", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/jon-anderson-band-geeks-seventies-yes-tour-1235025967/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jon-Anderson-photo-by-Deborah-Anderson-2016.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:33:07", "author": "Andy Greene", "authors": ["Andy Greene"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.442}

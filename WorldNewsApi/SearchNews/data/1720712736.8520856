By Marcus Baram, Capital & Main Heather Ferguson loves to talk about her daughter\u2019s school in Johnson County, Kansas, and the quality of the state\u2019s education system, citing it as one of the main reasons that she moved here recently from Albuquerque. The school, which she says boasts excellent teachers, is an environmental lab that includes seven acres of woods and ponds where students can study hedgehogs and snakes. But Ferguson has concerns about recent proposals to cut state income taxes and their potential impact on the education budget. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see wear and tear of the school system\u201d if decreased revenues lead to budget cuts, a scenario which some Kansans fear could be a repeat of the \u201cBrownback experiment\u201d in 2012 and 2013. That\u2019s when then-Gov. Sam Brownback sharply cut income taxes in the state, guided by conservative think tanks and wealthy donors like Charles Koch. The experiment benefited rich Kansans but decimated the state budget, leading to massive cuts in education and vital services, which in turn resulted in early school closings, cuts to the state\u2019s Medicaid program and delayed highway repairs. The bill cut the taxes of the wealthiest 1% of Kansans, while low-income families saw some of their taxes increase, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It also hurt the economy, with job growth in the state trailing far behind that of its neighbors and ranking at less than half the national average, despite business tax cuts that Brownback promised would be a \u201cshot of adrenaline\u201d to the state\u2019s economy. Though these tax reductions were widely considered a failure, some of the same forces that backed them are now pushing through income tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy in Kansas as well as in Mississippi and other states. Trickle-Down Economics Makes a Comeback The return of trickle-down economics\u2014the much-criticized theory that tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy eventually result in job growth and higher wages for the middle class and working class\u2014has inspired a fierce debate in the Kansas Legislature that has gone on for months. A bill that included a flat 5.25% personal income tax, an 8% reduction from the current rate for top earners, was approved by Republicans in both chambers, though critics say it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy in the state. The top 20% of earners in Kansas\u2014those with average annual incomes above $315,000\u2014would get nearly 40% of the benefits, with Koch himself receiving an estimated $485,000 in annual tax breaks under the proposal, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group that favors a progressive tax system. It would also cost the state almost $650 million every year once fully implemented, per ITEP. The bill was sponsored by two lawmakers who have received campaign contributions from Koch and who have significant ties to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a national organization of conservative lawmakers and corporate interests that drafts \u201cmodel legislation\u201d for state legislatures to adopt and has long advocated for the elimination of state income taxes. Kansas state Sen. Ty Masterson was named the chairman of ALEC in December, and fellow Sen. Caryn Tyson was named the country\u2019s legislator of the year in 2021 by the group. Neither lawmaker returned calls for comment to Capital & Main. Though Gov. Brownback\u2019s tax reductions were widely considered a failure, some of the same forces that backed them are now pushing through income tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy in Kansas as well as in Mississippi and other states. Among other groups pushing for the GOP proposals are Americans for Prosperity, a conservative think tank formed decades ago by the wealthiest men in Kansas, Charles and David Koch. While the proposals were being debated, AFP representatives set up a lemonade stand outside the Kansas State House in Topeka to advertise their views. When the bill was first introduced, it was met with intense pushback from both Republicans and Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the trickle-down economics. It doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rob Olson in a speech on the floor of the state Senate. Facing a likely veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, the plan was tweaked by Republican leaders in the Legislature but continued to face fierce opposition. \u201cThe only true income tax relief that\u2019s being given is being given to the top bracket, the wealthiest,\u201d Democratic Senator and Senate Minority Leader Vic Miller told the Kansas Reflector. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to give tax relief, it should be directed to those who need it the most, not the ones that need it the least.\u201d When Kelly threatened another veto, Republican lawmakers denounced her as \u201cbeing a bit of a dictator,\u201d though they failed to get enough votes to override her previous vetoes. That pushed Tyson to plead with her colleagues: \u201cWhen you cast this vote, you are the deciding vote \u2026 you will decide for the almost 3 million people in Kansas. You decide whether they have tax relief.\u201d She has justified the tax cuts by pointing to the state\u2019s $3 billion budget surplus as well as projections that its revenue is expected to grow 9.7% by the close of the current fiscal year. The Long Shadow of the Brownback Experiment Looming over the fierce debate are memories of the Brownback experiment, which Miller calls a \u201cfailure that bankrupted the state\u201d and \u201crelied on accounting gimmicks\u201d to \u201csurvive the plummet in revenue.\u201d He tells Capital & Main that he\u2019s open to tax cuts, as long as they contain provisions that help middle-class and working-class voters. Last week, Kelly vetoed the latest Republican proposal, blaming GOP lawmakers for playing \u201cpolitical games with reckless tax policies.\u201d Previously, she had vetoed another bill that included a tax break pushed by Genesis Health Clubs, whose owner is a big donor to Republican legislators in the state. \u201cTaxpayer dollars should not be diverted to political donors under the guise of tax cuts,\u201d Kelly stated. Education advocate Adrienne Olejnik, vice president of Kansas Action for Children, told Capital & Main she\u2019s concerned that \u201ca significant shortage of revenue in the future could make cuts to vital family support programs, transportation, K-12 education, and Medicaid the first options lawmakers would seek instead of tax increases.\u201d Kelly called back members of the Legislature to Topeka for a special session, though she lacks the support for her own proposal that includes a smaller round of tax cuts, along with a child tax credit. Kansas is not the only state pushing for major tax reductions. Mississippi has fully succeeded in instituting its version of trickle-down economics, with Gov. Tate Reeves pushing two of the biggest income tax cuts in state history. Having won reelection last year, he\u2019s now calling for lawmakers to completely eliminate the personal income tax\u2014which makes up about one-third of state general fund revenue. And House Speaker Jason White has proposed replacing the income tax with a consumption tax, essentially taxing residents on what they spend rather than what they earn. Such regressive tax systems have been criticized by tax analysts for burdening working-class and middle-class people, who tend to spend more of their income on groceries and other essentials.(White\u2019s predecessor, Philip Gunn, who helped push Reeves\u2019 tax cuts through the state Legislature, has served as past chairman of ALEC\u2019s board of directors.) Painful Grocery Taxes Among the most contentious issues in the state is the grocery tax, which at 7% is among the highest in the country and disproportionately hurts poor Mississippians, say advocates. Though there is bipartisan support for cutting that tax, Reeves hasn\u2019t expressed a position on the idea. Reeves and White did not return calls for comment to Capital & Main. \u201cSales taxes on groceries have an especially harmful impact on income and racial inequities since low-income families tend to spend a larger share of their income on groceries,\u201d the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote in a 2020 report. \u201cState policymakers looking to make their tax codes more equitable should consider eliminating the sales taxes families pay on groceries if they haven\u2019t already done so, or at least reducing these taxes or partially offsetting them through a tax credit.\u201d Such a high grocery tax has been an issue for decades, criticized by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers but failing to get enough support to lower it. Back in 2006, late Republican state Sen. Alan Nunnelee said that it \u201cis just the most cruel tax any government can impose.\u201d The bottom 20% of wage earners in Mississippi (earning less than $19,300) pay 12.4% of their income in state and local taxes, more than any other income group. And the wealthiest 1% in the state, who make more than $362,300, pay just 6.9% of their income in state and local taxes, according to research from ITEP. That inequity has been criticized by advocates for the poor like Kyra Roby, policy analyst for One Voice, who proposes the addition of a 6% income tax bracket for those earning more than $100,000 annually. \u201cThere is not enough money to fund the programs that Mississippians need,\u201d said Roby. \u201cOur public schools are underfunded by $3.5 billion, our hospitals are closing though we have one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the country, and we have a water crisis, with residents going without water for weeks at a time.\u201d Yet she admits it\u2019s been hard to convince Mississippians to see the connection between personal income tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and painful reductions for such priorities as public education and public health. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s been a hard sale to link those everyday things to taxes,\u201d she noted. \u201cPeople just think, \u2018I don\u2019t want to pay taxes.\u2019 There is a lot of explaining in terms of what the impact would be.\u201d", "summary": "<p><strong><span style=\"text-align:start\">In Kansas, Mississippi, and other states, tax cuts for the wealthy could bring devastating reductions to education, health, and other vital programs.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"text-align:start\"><em>By Marcus Baram, <a href=\"https://capitalandmain.com/the-return-of-trickle-down-economics\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Capital &amp; Main</a></em></span></p>\n\n<p><span>Heather Ferguson loves to talk<span>&nbsp;</span>about her daughter\u2019s school in Johnson County, Kansas, and the quality of the state\u2019s education system, citing it as one of the main reasons that she moved here recently from Albuquerque.

Trump's attorneys described Willis' effort as a \"desperate bid to avoid disqualification,\" urging the court to let the issue proceed, according to ABC News.\n\nThis move follows Willis' motion last week asking the appeals court to dismiss Trump's appeal of a lower court's decision that allowed her to remain on the case. Trump and 18 others were indicted last August on charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Four defendants have since taken plea deals, agreeing to testify against others.\n\nJudge Scott McAfee allowed Willis to stay on the case despite acknowledging a \"significant appearance of impropriety\" due to her relationship with a top prosecutor on her team. Consequently, the election interference case has been paused as Trump's appeal is reviewed, reported Atlanta News First.\n\nIn his filing, Trump attorney Steve Sadow criticized Willis' motion, stating it was a \"calculated, disingenuous attempt to mislead this Court.\" He argued that the DA's office had no proper procedural grounds to dismiss the appeal, asserting that the focus should be on legal errors committed by the trial court, not the factual findings.\n\nWillis' office argued last week that there was a \"lack of sufficient evidence\" to support overturning the lower court's ruling, stating that only in \"very rare circumstances\" can appeals courts overturn such factual findings. The DA's filing emphasized that the trial court's extensive evaluation of the evidence foreclosed any possibility of reversal.\n\nDespite the DA's efforts, the Court of Appeals has agreed to hear Trump's appeal and paused the case pending the outcome, which is likely to delay proceedings until after the 2024 election, ABC News noted.\n\nIn response to the DA's motion, Sadow insisted that the issues in Trump's appeal are primarily legal, involving alleged misinterpretations and misapplications of the disqualification standard. He expressed optimism that the court would deny the DA's motion and proceed to decide the appeal on its merits.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "litty_simon@ibtimes.com", "name": "Litty Simon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4529133/former-us-president-donald-trump-pictured-may-30-2024-his-new-york-hush-money-trial-just-one.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668821", "eventUri": "eng-9668821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

We are optimistic that the Court will deny the motion and proceed to favorably decide the appeal on the merits,\" Steve Sadow, lead counsel for Trump, said in a statement.\n\nTrump co-defendant Michael Roman filed a motion in January seeking the disqualification of Willis because of an \"improper\" relationship with former special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nA hearing was held in March, and after several days of testimony, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a ruling that allowed Willis to stay on the case if Wade resigned. Wade resigned later that day.\n\nTrump and his co-defendants disagreed with McAfee's decision and requested permission to appeal. After they received it, they filed an appeal with the Georgia Court of Appeals. The appellate court then agreed to hear the appeal, and arguments are currently scheduled to be heard on Oct. 4.\n\nAccording to the response filed by Trump, the State (Willis) filed a motion, without citing any relevant authority, to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the Court of Appeals improvidently granted interlocutory review. Former President Trump and his co-appellants argue that there is no procedural basis for the State's motion and that it conflicts with applicable statutes and court rules.\n\nThe appellants also emphasized that the majority of the issues in the appeal are legal, not factual, and the trial court and Court of Appeals have already determined that the issues are critical and warrant interlocutory review.\n\nAdditionally, the appellants accuse the State of trying to mislead the Court to avoid disqualification, arguing that the motion to dismiss lacks legal basis and is an attempt to avoid addressing substantial legal errors.\n\nRECENT STORIES\n\nIn August 2023, a Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others, accusing them of engaging in an extensive scheme to illegally try to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.

(Atlanta News First) - Former President Donald Trump's legal counsel in the Peach State has issued a response to a motion filed by Fulton County's top prosecutor fighting an appeal to disqualify her from prosecuting the nation's 45th commander-in-chief and his GOP allies in an alleged attempt to overturn Georgia's 2020 election.\n\nSteve Sadow, Trump's Georgia legal counsel, said the former president is opposed to the \"state's meritless motion to dismiss the interlocutory appeal.\"\n\nThe appeal is to consider removing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from prosecuting Trump and 18 co-defendants in the Georgia case. Willis filed a motion to dismiss the appeal in mid-June, arguing it should be dissolved \"due to the lack of sufficient evidence.\"\n\n\"The Georgia Court of Appeals granted us the right to appeal after due and proper consideration. The state's 'Hail Mary' motion is an obvious attempt to stop appellate review of DA Willis' misconduct. We are optimistic that the court will deny the motion and proceed to favorably decide the appeal on the merits,\" Sadow said in a statement.\n\n>> READ THE FULL RESPONSE\n\nThe push to remove Willis from the case came after an explosive court filing brought to light the district attorney's relationship with now-former special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case -- if Wade were taken off the case. However, McAfee granted a request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling.\n\nWhile motions and responses have continuously been filed and made in the case, the Georgia Court of Appeals previously put a stay on all proceedings in the case. That means all hearings, arguments and other matters are on hold until the court rules on things it is currently hearing -- which includes whether Willis should be disqualified from prosecuting the case.\n\nTrump and 18 others were indicted in August 2023 by Willis and her office for an alleged attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the Peach State.", "source": {"uri": "atlantanewsfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlocutory_appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interlocutory appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superior court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Stop-Motion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Stop-Motion", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://gray-wgcl-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/ZXTTDJJYKFEQDJPB26IYO6BNOI.jpg?auth=f6730d8a65db36216edc9cee49d9f45ecc92c32fbf710b0b9038092f013b0060&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668821", "eventUri": "eng-9668821", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

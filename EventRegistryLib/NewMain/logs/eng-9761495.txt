Violations are punishable by up to a year in jail, plus thousands of dollars in criminal and civil fines.\n\nThe measure requires anyone who provides \"assessment, monitoring, and care\" during pregnancy, labor, childbirth and the postpartum period to be licensed.\n\nA group of women sued, arguing that a wide range of people, including midwives, doulas, lactation consultants and even family and friends of the new mother would be subject to penalties and criminal liability.\n\nTheir complaint also said the law threatens the plaintiffs' ability to serve women who seek traditional Native Hawaiian births.\n\nJudge Shirley Kawamura issued a ruling late Monday afternoon barring the state from \"enforcing, threatening to enforce or applying any penalties to those who practice, teach, and learn traditional Native Hawaiian healing practices of prenatal, maternal and child care.\"\n\nPlaintiffs testified during a four-day hearing last month that the law forces them to get licensed through costly out-of-state programs that don't align with Hawaiian culture.\n\nThe law constitutes a deprivation of Native Hawaiian customary rights, which are protected by the Hawaii constitution, Kawamura's ruling said, and the \"public interest weighs heavily towards protecting Native Hawaiian customs and traditions that are at risk of extinction.\"\n\nThe dispute is the latest in a long debate about how and whether Hawaii should regulate the practice of traditional healing arts that date to well before the islands became the 50th state in 1959. Those healing practices were banished or severely restricted for much of the 20th century, but the Hawaiian Indigenous rights movement of the 1970s renewed interest in them.\n\nThe state eventually adopted a system under which councils versed in Native Hawaiian healing certify traditional practitioners, though the plaintiffs in the lawsuit say their efforts to form such a council for midwifery have failed.\n\nThe judge also noted in her ruling that the preliminary injunction is granted until there is a council that can recognize traditional Hawaiian birthing practitioners.\n\n\"This ruling means that traditional Native Hawaiian midwives can once again care for families, including those who choose home births, who can't travel long distances, or who don't feel safe or seen in other medical environments,\" plaintiff and midwife trainee Makalani Franco-Francis said in a statement Wednesday. \"We are now free to use our own community wisdom to care for one another without fear of prosecution.\"\n\nThe judge found, however, that the state's regulation of midwifery more broadly speaking is \"reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of mothers and their newborns.\"\n\nThe ruling doesn't block the law as it pertains to unlicensed midwives who do not focus on Hawaiian birthing practices, said Hillary Schneller, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the women. \"That is a gap that this order doesn't address.\"\n\nThe case is expected to continue to trial to determine whether the law should be permanently blocked.\n\nThe state attorney general's office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "timesunion.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

I am a proud Native Hawaiian from Miloli\u02bbi, South Kona, and prior to elected office, I served as the Executive Director of Pa\u02bba Pono Miloli\u02bbi, a native Hawaiian non-profit dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage as well as enhancing the health and well being of the Miloli\u02bbi and South Kona community.\n\nI have the distinct honor of being the second Native Hawaiian elected to Congress since Statehood, where I have been a steadfast champion for Native Hawaiian and indigenous rights. My work in Congress focused on advocating for policies that protected our lands, enhanced our cultural practices, right historical injustices and supported the well-being of the Native Hawaiian people.\n\nFurthermore, my personal life is deeply rooted in our culture. My two daughters attend Ke Kula \u02bbo N\u0101wah\u012bokalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu in Kea\u02bbau, a Hawaiian language immersion school, ensuring that our family remains connected to our language and traditions. This personal commitment underscores my dedication to preserving and promoting our cultural heritage and language revitalization efforts for future generations.\n\nI beliebe these experiences and commitments uniquely qualify me to serve and represent the Native Hawaiian community effectively.\n\nThe primary issue facing the Native Hawaiian community is our increasing diaspora due to economic challenges, which has led to a majority of Native Hawaiians (53%) residing on the U.S. mainland rather than in Hawai\u02bbi. This dispersal weakens efforts to advocate for community rights. To tackle this, focusing on the following key areas is essential:\n\nAffordable Housing: Advocating policies for more affordable housing options to help families stay in their ancestral lands.\n\nEconomic Development: Supporting sustainable job creation, especially in sectors aligning with cultural heritage like local agriculture and renewable energy.\n\nEducation and Training: Investing in vocational programs for skills necessary in high-demand local jobs, reducing the need to seek work elsewhere.\n\nCultural Preservation: Strengthening Native Hawaiian identity and community unity by enhancing initiatives that protect and promote Hawaiian culture and language.\n\nCommunity Support: Building networks for Hawaiians outside Hawai\u02bbi with virtual programs and language classes to stay connected.\n\nHealthcare Access: Improving access to quality healthcare services in rural and underserved areas to ensure the well-being of the community.\n\nThese strategies aim to enable Native Hawaiians to flourish, maintain a strong unified voice in advocacy, and ensure community preservation and empowerment.\n\nNo, I do not support the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT).\n\nThe state has a constitutional duty to protect its natural and cultural resources for present and future generations. As Justice Michael Wilson's November 30, 2018, dissent highlights, the TMT violates the constitutional and statutory protections afforded to natural resources in the state's conservation district. This project contravenes the Hawai\u02bbi Public Trust Doctrine, the Hawai\u02bbi Constitution, and laws concerning conservation land, specifically HRS Chapter 183C.\n\nThe TMT will cause significant, adverse impacts to the existing natural and cultural resources on the proposed project site. Mauna Kea holds immense cultural and spiritual importance for Native Hawaiians, and its conservation status should be respected. No amount of compensation, mitigation, or economic benefit can legally justify the irreversible damage that would be caused. The state's duty to protect Mauna Kea's natural and cultural resources for future generations outweighs any potential economic benefits.\n\nPreserving Mauna Kea's integrity is crucial for respecting Native Hawaiian cultural heritage and ensuring the protection of this sacred site.\n\nI believe the best use of OHA's Kakaako Makai lands should reflect the cultural, economic, and housing interests of the Native Hawaiian community. Hakuone, OHA's planned development in Kaka\u02bbako Makai, should prioritize cultural preservation, housing, economic development, environmental sustainability, as well as education and innovation.\n\nIn 2012, the State settled a 32-year-old debt by conveying to OHA 30 acres of land valued at over $200 million, with the understanding that residential development was included in the value. Today, OHA owns just 30 of the 221 acres in Kaka\u02bbako Makai, which is only 14% of the total area. Of this 14%, OHA wants to develop three parcels for residential development.\n\nRegarding building residential high rises, I support building residential high-rises in these parcels, however, it is essential that any development is carried out in a manner that respects and incorporates our cultural heritage, promotes sustainability, and benefits the community as a whole. Residential development in this area can address the housing needs of the Native Hawaiian community while also generating revenue to support OHA's broader mission and programs.\n\nHere are some considerations:\n\nImpact Assessment: Conduct thorough assessments of the potential impacts on traffic, infrastructure, and local communities.\n\nCommunity Input: Engage in extensive consultations with the Native Hawaiian community, the Kakaako community, area legislators and other stakeholders to ensure their voices are heard and considered.\n\nMixed-Use Development: If high-rises are considered, they should be part of a mixed-use development that includes cultural, commercial, and green spaces, ensuring they contribute positively to the community.\n\nOHA should play a proactive role in helping Native Hawaiians cope with Hawai\u02bbi's high cost of living. One innovative approach I would like OHA to explore is implementing a guaranteed basic income program pilot project. This initiative would provide a recurring monthly payment directly to Native Hawaiian households that demonstrate a need, aiming to supplement, not replace, existing social safety nets.\n\nDuring my time in Congress, I saw the positive impact of COVID-era monthly federal child tax credit payments, which essentially functioned as a form of guaranteed basic income and lifted many families out of poverty. This experience demonstrated that putting money directly into the pockets of those struggling is one of the most impactful ways to help them immediately cope with the high cost of living or weather financial challenges.\n\nBy exploring and potentially implementing a similar program in Hawai\u02bbi, OHA can provide direct support to struggling Native Hawaiian households, ensuring they have the resources needed to meet their basic needs and improve their quality of life.\n\nOHA should play a significant role in reshaping Hawai\u02bbi's tourism industry to ensure it balances economic benefits with the preservation of natural resources and cultural heritage. The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, which oversees destination management for Hawai\u02bbi, emphasizes place-based and indigenous tourism. This approach ensures visitors understand and appreciate the unique significance of Hawai\u02bbi, encouraging them to engage with local culture for a memorable and respectful experience.\n\nKey areas for improvement include:\n\nSustainable Tourism Practices: Implementing policies that protect Hawai\u02bbi's environment and natural resources is crucial. This ensures that tourism does not degrade the very assets that attract visitors.\n\nCultural Sensitivity: Promoting tourism that respects Hawaiian culture is essential. Native Hawaiian communities should be involved in tourism development and management to ensure their perspectives and needs are considered.\n\nCommunity Involvement: Ensuring that tourism benefits local communities is vital. This can be achieved by supporting local businesses and creating job opportunities for residents, ensuring that the economic benefits of tourism are widely shared.\n\nCapacity Management: Regulating visitor numbers is necessary to prevent over-tourism and the resulting strain on infrastructure and natural sites. This helps maintain the quality of life for residents and the quality of experience for visitors.\n\nEducation: Educating tourists about respectful behavior and the cultural significance of the places they visit fosters appreciation and understanding of Hawaiian culture. This can lead to more meaningful and respectful interactions between visitors and the local community.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, OHA can help reshape Hawai\u02bbi's tourism industry into one that supports sustainable economic growth while preserving the cultural and natural heritage that makes Hawai\u02bbi unique.\n\nTransparency within the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) is crucial for trust and community engagement. If elected, I will focus on enhancing transparency through these initiatives:\n\nOpen Communication Channels: Implement regular community meetings and virtual town halls to discuss OHA's activities and decisions, allowing for open dialogue and feedback.\n\nAccessible Information: Ensure all OHA documents, including meeting minutes, financial reports, and strategic plans, are easily accessible online via a user-friendly digital portal.\n\nFinancial Transparency: Introduce a comprehensive financial transparency policy with detailed quarterly and annual financial reports, clearly explaining fund allocation and spending.\n\nStakeholder Engagement: Establish advisory councils of community leaders and cultural practitioners to provide input on key decisions, ensuring diverse voices are heard.\n\nPerformance Metrics: Develop and share performance metrics for OHA programs, demonstrating progress and areas for improvement.\n\nCultural Education: Invest in educational programs to inform the community about OHA's mission, roles, and responsibilities, fostering greater engagement and participation.\n\nThese measures will create an environment of mutual respect and accountability, ensuring\n\nOHA remains a trusted advocate for the Native Hawaiian people.\n\nIf elected to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, my top priority will be to strengthen and reestablish relationships at the State Legislature while enhancing constituent services on Hawai\u02bbi Island. These efforts are essential to effectively advocate for the needs and interests of Native Hawaiians.\n\nStrengthening relationships with the State Legislature involves fostering open communication, building trust, and collaborating on policies that benefit our community. By doing so, we can ensure that the voices of Native Hawaiians are heard and their concerns are addressed at the highest levels of state government.\n\nEnhancing constituent services on Hawai\u02bbi Island means providing more accessible, efficient, and responsive support to our community members. This includes addressing their immediate needs, offering guidance on available resources, and ensuring that their issues are promptly resolved. My goal is to create a stronger, more connected, and better-served Hawaiian community.\n\nCombining these efforts will help create a solid foundation for achieving meaningful progress and lasting positive impact for the Native Hawaiian community.\n\nI would like voters to know that my commitment to service is at the core of who I am. Having served our nation as a combat veteran and a Lieutenant Colonel in the Hawai\u02bbi Air National Guard, I understand the importance of dedication, sacrifice, and leadership. My experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan have shaped my perspective on the value of national service and the duty we have to our communities.\n\nIn addition to my military service, I have dedicated the last eight years of my life to serving the people of Hawai\u02bbi as a State Senator and as a Representative for Hawai\u02bbi's 2nd Congressional District. Through these roles, I have worked tirelessly to represent our community's interests, fight for Hawaii\u02bbs working class families and advocate for policies that promote our well-being and cultural heritage. My goal is to continue this tradition of service, focusing on strengthening our community, preserving our culture, and ensuring that every Native Hawaiian has the opportunity to thrive.\n\nWith your support, I am committed to bringing my experience, dedication, and vision to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to make a lasting positive impact for our Native Hawaiians and those who call Hawai\u02bbi home.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaka\u02bbako", "type":

Fatima, a former world champion javelin thrower and Olympic Medallist, shared her personal experiences of care, inspiring those who attended with her journey from care to the pinnacle of athletic success. \"I have first-hand experience of how Foster Care can change lives,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent my first fourteen years in children\u2019s homes. \"It is so important that we have some really good loving families coming forward to open their hearts, their homes and give a child a loving secure lifeline, because at the end of the day, every child deserves a safe and happy childhood.\u201d Speaking about her support of Foster Care Fortnight, Fatima said: \"We want to be able to give those children in the care system the opportunity like everyone else has with their conventional families, helping them, guiding them and giving them stability, security and the love and support they so deserve. \u201cThat is why I am dedicated to building a better future for those in the care system. I know change is possible when people come together to work for a shared vision. \u201cIt was my privilege to meet with and celebrate fostering families during my visit here. I would encourage more of the local community to come forward and consider becoming Foster Carers to make a real difference to the lives of children and young people.\u201d Noelene Thomas, a parent involved in the Step Up Step Down service in the South Eastern area described her fostering experience and stated: \u201cIt really gave me hope, from nothing you can become something amazing. The Step Up Step Down service gave the children a lot of hope too, that they can start out nowhere and they can now achieve amazing things.\u201d Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, Chris Quinn was delighted to attend the event and added: \u201cThe impact that Foster Carers can have on children and young people can be life-changing. \"We have heard consistently from children and young people who are care-experienced about the importance of Foster Care and involving them and Foster Carers in the decision-making process with regards to their transition and placements. \u201cFoster Carers provide stability, love and opportunities for children in care, helping them to achieve their full potential. It is a privilege to be here to celebrate the incredible work that they do.\u201d Head of Fostering and Adoption in the South Eastern area, Nuala Hanna remarked: \u201cThis has been a fabulous event and a wonderful opportunity to recognise and celebrate the fabulous work our Foster Cares undertake improving the lives of children and young people. \"Fatima\u2019s story is a testament to the positive impact that care and support can have on a young person\u2019s life. \u201cWe hope that her presence will inspire more people to consider becoming Foster Carers.\u201d", "summary": "Olympic hero, Fatima Whitbread, MBE met with families, foster carers, children, and staff from HSC NI Foster Care within the South Eastern and Belfast areas along with the Commissioner for Children and Young People, Chris Quinn at a heart-warming event organised by The Fostering Network to mark the end of Foster Care Fortnight.", "url": "https://www.northernirelandworld.com/health/olympic-hero-fatima-whitbread-celebrates-foster-care-fortnight-with-children-families-and-staff-4646487", "image": "https://www.northernirelandworld.com/webimg/b25lY21zOmJiZTE2MzY4LTVlNTktNGIxYS05NjIxLWY0M2ZlMzk4NDZhZTo2N2E5NDM5Ni04NGNhLTRmZDYtYWZiYS01NjRjMzBkODA1ZWE=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:05:43", "author": "Julie-Ann Spence", "authors": ["Julie-Ann Spence"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.668}

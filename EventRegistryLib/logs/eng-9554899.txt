Packers training camp is known for kids providing bike rides to players from locker room to practice field, and that will be represented by Tuesday's event. Bicyclists from the Packers, Travel Wisconsin, Wisconsin Bike Fed and Green Bay area bike shops and bike advocates will participate.\n\nThe draft has been advertised as a year-long advertisement for Green Bay and Wisconsin, and Tuesday's trip from Milwaukee to Green Bay is an example. The bicycle element, named Pedal to the Draft, will highlight Wisconsin's outdoor recreation attractions as it winds its way from the Lake Michigan waterfront to 1265 Lombardi Ave.\n\n\"Football fans from around the country and world will be making their way to Green Bay to attend the NFL draft and appreciate the history and traditions of the Packers,\" said Packers President and CEO Mark Murphy. \"They'll also get to experience all that the state of Wisconsin has to offer and the Pedal to the Draft is a fun way to get us started and celebrate both.\"\n\nPackers bike kids invited to participate in ride to Lambeau Field\n\nThe football will arrive in Milwaukee at 11:45 a.m. Tuesday and get to Green Bay about 6 p.m. Bicyclists will ride up Armed Forces Drive, stopping at Ray Nitschke Field to pick up any bike kids before riding on to the atrium, where the 2025 NFL Draft Countdown Clock will be unveiled. Bike kids are invited to meet at the entrance to Nitschke Field on Armed Forces Drive by 6 p.m. to join the ride to the Lambeau Field Atrium.\n\nProgress of the football can be followed on social media and at Packers.com. The hashtag is #PedalToTheDraft.\n\nThe countdown clock unveiling at about 6:30 p.m. is open to the public.\n\nThe draft has been tabbed as the biggest event ever to be held in Green Bay. Organizers expect attendance of 250,000 over the three-day event and economic impact of $20 million in Brown County and $94 million statewide. Because attendance is counted separately each day of the event, there could be anywhere from the same 83,000 visitors each day to 250,000 unique visitors overall. Some 80,000 visitors at one time would be equivalent to a Green Bay Packers game.\n\nMore: More games at Lambeau Field, NFL draft could add $70 million to Brown County economy\n\nDetroit had a record-setting 275,000 fans attend the first day of the event and an overall record of 775,000, smashing the previous high of 600,000 in Nashville in 2019. Organizers believe much of the Detroit turnout was local, drawn from the metro area's 4.3 million residents.\n\nDraft will need hotel rooms across eastern Wisconsin\n\nAttendance for the Green Bay event could be constrained by Brown County's smaller population of 270,000, and the smaller number of local hotel rooms, 4,800 in the Green Bay area versus 45,000 in Detroit. The NFL reportedly booked most of the rooms in Green Bay for their workers, networks and vendors, so fans are expected to stay in hotels from Green Bay to Milwaukee and Madison. Green Bay is an hour and a-half drive from Milwaukee and about 2\u00bd hours from Madison.\n\nMore: Coming to Green Bay for the 2025 NFL draft? Here's how close you can stay to Lambeau Field\n\nMore: Want to rent your home on Airbnb when Green Bay hosts the 2025 NFL draft? What to know\n\nThe Packers and Discover Green Bay are the lead organizers, although putting on the draft will require participation from all municipalities in the county and law enforcement from around the state. The NFL will plan the draft and its events, but local organizers have to carry out much of that plan. Local organizers must raise at least $7.5 million to host the event. The Packers contributed $1 million to the cause and the state kicked in $2 million more. The rest will come from businesses and Packers sponsors.\n\nThe NFL has not yet said where the stage or other elements, such as the NFL Experience, will be located. It is certain, however, the stage will not be in the Lambeau Field bowl. The Green Bay footprint for the draft includes Lambeau Field, Titletown and the Resch Center complex. Organizers also will look for ways to include downtown Green Bay and other municipalities in events.\n\nContact Richard Ryman at rryman@gannett.com.

Green Bay's set to take the reins for the 2025 NFL Draft, but ESPN's Adam Schefter has recently raised eyebrows, questioning if the city can handle the massive event after Detroit's epic turnout.\n\nIn a recent episode of \"The Adam Schefter Show,\" the ESPN Insider, alongside colleague Daniel Dopp, delved into the looming question: Is Green Bay truly prepared to host the NFL Draft amid its surging popularity and attendance?\n\n\"I know they do it for Packers games. But where are all the players going to be staying, in hotel rooms? Where are the NFL officials going to be staying, in the hotel rooms? Again this happens. But you know what, what occurred to me is, I guess there are people who can stay in Appleton. There are people who can stay in Milwaukee.\"\n\nAdam Schefter further mentioned that Milwaukee's hosting the Republican National Convention might serve as a bit of practice for them to handle the NFL Draft in 2025.\n\nHe thinks it could help them understand the scale of such events and prepare accordingly. Despite his concerns, The ESPN Analyst sees this as an exciting time for Wisconsin.\n\nAmidst the ongoing preparations for the 2025 NFL Draft in Green Bay, the primary venues are earmarked to be Lambeau Field and the surrounding Titletown campus, complemented by nearby locales. The festivities are poised to provide multiple days of excitement across the city.\n\nMoreover, the NFL Draft Experience, situated adjacent to Lambeau Field, promises an expansive celebration of football. The people attending can participate in games, interactive displays, player interactions, sponsor showcases, and particularly designed activities for fans of all ages.\n\nThe NFL Draft has transformed into a multi-day spectacle, featuring free concerts and entertainment as part of the NFL Draft Concert Series.\n\nThe event includes a number of community programs designed to have a good influence. These initiatives are focused on issues like social justice, military appreciation, and adolescent well-being, providing a strong sense of community spirit.\n\nAlongside the celebrations, the NFL Draft Theater takes center stage, hosting the Commissioner and other notable figures as they unveil draft picks amidst captivating concert performances.

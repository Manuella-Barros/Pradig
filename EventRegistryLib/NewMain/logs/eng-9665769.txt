Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom under a bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on Wednesday. (AP Photo/Al Behrman, File)\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow.

The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov.

(AP) -- Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom under a bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow.

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov.

(AP) -- Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom under a bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe displays, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nThe posters would be paid for through donations. State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantavoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlanta Voice | Atlanta GA News"},

(AP) -- Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom under a bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe displays, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nThe posters would be paid for through donations. State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nMore from this section\n\nLatinx Festival on L.

Opponents questioned the law's constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\u009d The posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\"\u009d describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\"\u009d must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025. Under the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations. The law also \"authorizes\"\u009d but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America's \"First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory - in the present day Midwest - and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union. Not long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it. The law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon. \"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\"\u009d the groups said. The controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda. Similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has succeeded in making the bills law. Legal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\"\u009d The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose. ___ Associated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed. ___ The story has been corrected to clarify that the time for gubernatorial action did not lapse. The governor signed the bill Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name":

Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\nOpponents questioned the law's constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America's \"First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory -- in the present day Midwest -- and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nThe controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah.

Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which

In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nRelated New Mexico city argues for keeping Ten Commandments monument outside City Hall\n\nThe posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America's \"First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory - in the present day Midwest - and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nThe controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has succeeded in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Bloomfield, N.M., argues for keeping Ten Commandments monument outside City Hall\n\nSend

Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\nOpponents questioned the law's constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America's \"First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory -- in the present day Midwest -- and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nThe controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has succeeded in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten

(AP) -- Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom, the latest move from a GOP-dominated Legislature pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor.\n\nThe legislation that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\nOpponents questioned the law's constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America's \"First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory -- in the present day Midwest -- and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nThe controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has succeeded in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nThe story has been corrected to clarify that the time for gubernatorial action did not lapse. The governor signed the bill Wednesday.\n\nMore from this section\n\nOver 75 million people in the US are under heat alerts.

In 2023, it joined almost 20 states that require or allow officials in public schools to post the national motto, \"In God We Trust.\"\n\nNow, the Bayou State could become the first in the nation to require the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms in public schools, colleges and universities.\n\nLawmakers approved House Bill 71 on May 28, 2024, though Gov. Jeff Landry has not yet signed it into law. The bill would require officials in public schools, including colleges and universities, to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments. The text is similar to the King James translation of the Bible used in many Protestant churches.\n\nOfficials must post a context statement highlighting the role of the Ten Commandments in American history and may also display the Pilgrims' Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, a federal enactment to settle the frontier - and the earliest congressional document encouraging the creation of schools.\n\nOne of the bill's supporters, state Sen. J. Adam Bass, defended it on the grounds that its \"purpose is not solely religious.\" He told fellow lawmakers that the Ten Commandments are important because of their \"historical significance, which is simply one of many documents that display the history of our country and foundation of our legal system.\"\n\nAs someone who teaches and researches law around religion and education, I believe the bill is problematic. It is likely to invite litigation at a time when the Supreme Court's thinking on religion and state is shifting.\n\nLitigation over the Ten Commandments is not new. More than 40 years ago, in Stone v. Graham, the Supreme Court rejected a Kentucky statute that mandated displays of the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\n\nThe court reasoned that the underlying law violated the First Amendment's establishment clause - \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" - because the mandate lacked a secular purpose.\n\nThe justices were not persuaded by a small notation on posters that described the Ten Commandments as the \"fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States.\"\n\nTwenty-five years later, the Supreme Court again took up cases challenging public displays of the Ten Commandments, although not in schools. This time, the justices reached mixed results.\n\nThe first arose in Kentucky, where officials had erected a county courthouse display about texts including the Ten Commandments, the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and a biblical citation. In a 2005 ruling in McCreary County, Kentucky v. American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, the five-person majority agreed that display of the Ten Commandments violated the establishment clause, largely because it lacked a secular legislative purpose.\n\nOn the same day, however, the Supreme Court reached the opposite result in Van Orden v. Perry, a case from Texas. The court upheld the constitutionality of a display of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol as one of 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating Texas' history.\n\nUnlike the fairly new display in Kentucky, the one in Texas, which had existed since the early 1960s, was erected using private funds. The court permitted the Ten Commandments to remain because, despite their religious significance, the monument was a more passive display than in Stone: spread out across 22 acres, rather than posted on the courthouse door.\n\nLouisiana's bill would require public school officials to display framed copies of the Ten Commandments in all public school classrooms. Posters must be at least 11-by-14 inches and be printed with a large, easily readable font. The proposal allows, but does not require, officials to use state funds to purchase these posters. Displays can also be received as donations or purchased with gifted funds.\n\nThe bill's author, state Rep. Dodie Horton, previously sponsored Louisiana's law mandating that \"In God We Trust\" be posted in public school classrooms.\n\nIn defending the Ten Commandments proposal, she said it honors the country's religious origins.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments are the basis of all laws in Louisiana,\" she told fellow lawmakers, \"and given all the junk our children are exposed to in classrooms today, it's imperative that we put the Ten Commandments back in a prominent position.\"\n\nJustifying the bill, Horton pointed to Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, a 2022 Supreme Court decision. Here, the justices held that educational officials could not prevent a football coach from praying on the field at the end of games, because he engaged in personal religious observance protected by the First Amendment.\n\nFor decades, the Supreme Court used a set of criteria often called the Lemon v. Kurtzman test to assess whether a government action violated the establishment clause. Under this test, when a government action or policy intersects with religion, it had to meet three criteria. A policy had to have a secular legislative purpose; its principal or primary effect could not advance religion; and it could not result in excessive entanglement between state and religious officials.\n\nAnother test the Supreme Court sometimes applied, stemming from Lynch v. Donnelly in 1984, invalidated governmental actions appearing to endorse religion.\n\nThe majority of the current court, though, abandoned both the Lemon and endorsement tests. In the majority opinion in Kennedy v. Bremerton, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that \"the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by 'reference to historical practices and understandings.'\" He added that the court \"long ago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test offshoot.\"\n\nWhat that new standard means remains to be seen.\n\nIn my view, the bill's supporters' reliance on Kennedy is mistaken. That decision upheld voluntary, private prayer, not mandated postings of religious statements, overlooking many students' beliefs.\n\nMore than 80 years ago, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette the Supreme Court decided in a 6-3 opinion that students cannot be compelled to participate in saluting the American flag, including the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, if doing so goes against their religious beliefs.\n\nUnder Louisiana's new bill, students need not recite the Ten Commandments. Yet, given their distinctly religious message, I believe House Bill 71 faces a dubious future if signed into law.", "source": {"uri": "flaglerlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FlaglerLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Declaration of Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northwest Ordinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower_Compact", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayflower Compact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_We_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "In God We Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrims_(Plymouth_Colony)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King James Version"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Jeff Landry. The law mandates a poster-sized display in \"large, easily readable font\" in classrooms from kindergarten through state-funded universities. Although Gov. Landry did not provide final approval, the time for gubernatorial action has lapsed, allowing the bill to become law.\n\nThe legislation requires that the Ten Commandments be displayed alongside a four-paragraph context statement by the start of 2025.This statement will describe the historical presence of the Ten Commandments in American public education for almost three centuries. The posters will be funded through donations, as state funds will not be used to implement the mandate.\n\nProponents of the law argue that the Ten Commandments are historically significant and describe them as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe law also authorizes, but does not require, the display of other historical documents such as the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nOpponents have raised concerns about the law's constitutionality, with civil rights groups and organizations that support the separation of church and state promising to file a lawsuit challenging it. These groups argue the law prevents students from receiving an equal education and could make students with different beliefs feel unsafe at school.\n\nLegal challenges over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that a similar law in Kentucky was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits Congress from making laws respecting an establishment of religion. The high court found that the Kentucky law had no secular purpose and served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's law emerges in a period of conservative leadership under Gov. Landry, who took office in January, succeeding two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. The Republican Party currently holds a two-thirds supermajority in the Louisiana Legislature, and all statewide elected positions are filled by Republicans, facilitating the passage of a conservative agenda.\n\nThe law specifies that the Ten Commandments be displayed in a \"large, easily readable font\" and includes a context statement highlighting their significance in American public education history. This statement must explain how the Ten Commandments played a significant role in education for almost three centuries.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said in their joint statement.\n\nThis new law, unique to Louisiana, reflects ongoing tensions over the separation of church and state. As civil rights groups prepare for legal challenges, the state prepares for the mandate's implementation. The outcome of these legal battles will likely set a precedent for other states that have proposed similar bills, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah, but have yet to enact them due to constitutional concerns.\n\n(With agency inputs)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday (June 19).\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation jointly announced plans to file a lawsuit challenging the new law.\n\n\"We are preparing a lawsuit to challenge HB 71,\" the groups said in a statement. \"The law violates the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional. The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\n\n\"Louisiana's communities and public schools are religiously diverse, yet HB 71 would require school officials to promote specific religious beliefs to which people of many faiths, and those of no faith, do not subscribe. Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate, and it certainly should not be coercing students to submit day in and day out to unavoidable promotions of religious doctrine.\n\n\"All students should feel safe and welcome in our public schools. HB 71 would undermine this critical goal and prevent schools from providing an equal education to all students, regardless of faith. We will not allow Louisiana lawmakers to undermine these religious-freedom rights.\"\n\nProponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe displays, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nThe posters would be paid for through donations. State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.", "source": {"uri": "wafb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jeff Landry vows to sign bill Ten Commandments bill", "body": "Gov. Jeff Landry said he plans to sign into law a controversial bill requiring public schools and colleges in Louisiana to post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms and that he is welcoming challenges to the law in court.\n\nDuring his keynote speech on Saturday at a Republican fundraiser in Tennessee, Landry touted the bill as a conservative victory in the ongoing culture wars.\n\n\"I'm going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms,\" he said, according to a report in the Tennessean. \"And I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nLandry, a Republican, was the state's attorney general before becoming governor. If he signs the bill, Louisiana will become the only state mandating that all public universities and K-12 schools display the Ten Commandments in every classroom, a move that will almost certainly draw legal challenges.\n\nLandry's staunch support for House Bill 71 comes after free-speech groups condemned it as an unconstitutional violation of the separation of church and state. The Center for Inquiry, a nonprofit that opposes religious influences on public policy, called the bill \"unlawful\" in a June 14 letter to Landry.\n\n\"It is meant to impose Christianity on all students in Louisiana's public schools, even if they belong to a minority religion or no religion at all,\" wrote Azhar Majeed, the group's director of government affairs.\n\nCritics say the bill violates the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from \"establishing\" a religion. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law requiring public schools to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms. Groups that promote the separation of church and state argue that Louisiana's law would be equally unconstitutional.\n\nSome religious leaders have also opposed the mandate. More than 100 Christian pastors and churchgoers in Louisiana signing a petition last month urging Landry to veto the bill. They argued that families and faith groups should control religious education -- not the government. The Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, which advocates for the separation of church and state, also called on Landry to veto the legislation, arguing that it \"disrespects religious diversity.\"\n\n\"Signing HB71 into law will invite legal challenges and force Louisiana taxpayers to defend a dubious endeavor that is harmful to religious freedom,\" wrote Holly Hollman, general counsel for the group, which has also filed legal briefs arguing that public school employees should not lead students in prayer and the government should not fund religious schools.\n\nState Rep. Dodie Horton, R-Haughton, sponsored the legislation. She argued the law is constitutional, pointing to a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that upheld a public school football coach's right to pray on the field.\n\nShe added that her bill is not meant to indoctrinate children, but to give them \"guidelines.\"\n\n\"It doesn't preach a certain religion, but it does teach a standard,\" she said, adding that the Ten Commandments offer a moral code that God \"holds us accountable to live by.\"\n\nThe bill, which the state Senate passed by a vote of 30-8 last month after it passed in the House, requires public schools to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms by Jan. 1. The displays must measure at least 11 by 14 inches and feature \"large, easily readable font.\"\n\nThe legislation also dictates the exact wording that must be displayed. One portion reads: \"I AM the LORD thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" Another says: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.\"\n\nIt isn't clear how lawmakers decided which text to mandate. The petition calling on Landry to veto the legislation said different faith traditions translate and interpret the Ten Commandments differently. It called the text in the bill \"a hodgepodge of holy scripture,\" and said the government \"has no business choosing an official version of the Ten Commandments.\"\n\nRev. Jon Parks, senior co-pastor at University Baptist Church in Baton Rouge, said that displaying the Ten Commandments in public schools will cause some students to feel excluded.\n\n\"To me that is a clear case of the government saying this religion is more important than the others,\" said Parks, who signed the petition. \"There are places where the Ten Commandments belong -- and the classroom is not it.\"\n\nThe final version of the bill includes several amendments meant to head off potential legal challenges. Schools must post a \"context statement\" alongside the Biblical text that says the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\" Schools \"may\" also display other historical texts, such as the Declaration of Independence.\n\nProponents of the bill say the Ten Commandments belong in public schools because of its historical significance.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments provide the foundation for modern-day law in America,\" said Gene Mills, president of the Louisiana Family Forum, a conservative advocacy group. He added the bill's amendments will be useful \"if it's going to survive a constitutional challenge.\"", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors":

(Gary Tramontina/Getty Images)\n\nLouisiana has become the first state to enact a law mandating that the Ten Commandments be prominently displayed at all public schools and colleges.\n\nUnder a bill that became law on June 18, Louisiana schools that receive state funds will have to display the Ten Commandments \"in each building it uses and classroom in each school under its jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe bill specifies that the text must be presented at the main focal point of a poster or framed document measuring at least 11 inches by 14 inches and printed in a \"large and easily readable font.\"\n\nIt also requires a 200-word \"context statement\" explaining that the Ten Commandments were \"a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\"\n\nThe Republican-backed measure passed the state Senate by a 30-8 margin on May 16. It reached Republican Gov. Jeff Landry's desk after receiving a final House approval in a 79-16 vote on May 28.\n\nThe measure was spearheaded by Republican state Rep. Dodie Horton. Last year, she successfully led a legislative effort to require the national motto \"In God We Trust\" to be displayed in classrooms across the state.\n\nMore than a dozen states have enacted laws mandating or explicitly allowing schools to display the phrase, but the Louisiana law goes one step further to require signage to be displayed in each individual classroom.\n\nIn 1980, a divided U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom, holding that the law signaled the government endorsement of \"a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths\" in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\n\"If the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are to have any effect at all, it will be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments,\" the high court's 5-4 majority wrote at the time. \"However desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion, it is not a permissible state objective under the Establishment Clause.\"\n\nIn recent years, the Supreme Court appears to have become more open to a less restrictive interpretation of the Establishment Clause while placing greater emphasis on the country's history and tradition.\n\nIn defense of her Ten Commandments measure, Ms. Horton has highlighted the text's historical significance, arguing that the bill honors its unique place in Louisiana's history. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\n\"The Ten Commandments are the basis of all laws in Louisiana,\" she said on the House floor in April. \"And given all the junk our children are exposed to in classrooms today, it's imperative that we put the Ten Commandments back in a prominent position.\"\n\n\"It doesn't preach a certain religion, but it definitely shows what a moral code that we all should live by is,\" she said.\n\nLast year, the Texas Senate approved similar bill, however, it bill died after the House failed to vote on it before a deadline passed.\n\nA Utah bill, meanwhile, would have required all of the state's public schools to \"display a poster or framed copy\" of the Ten Commandments in a \"prominent location\" in every one of their buildings. The bill has since been changed to instead allow the biblical principles to be taught as part of school curricula.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodie_Horton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodie Horton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_We_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In God We Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religious text"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/id1000285-GettyImages-2399301-OP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665769", "eventUri": "eng-9665769", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 337, "textEnd": 344}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 953, "textEnd": 959}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 1065, "textEnd": 1071}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime-courts Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

be sued' after forcing Ten Commandments in schools", "body": "Louisiana's Republican Governor Jeff Landry is looking for a legal fight after mandating the Ten Commandments in every classroom in the state.\n\n\"I'm going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms,\" he said during a recent GOP fundraiser in Tennessee. \"I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nLandry signed the bill into law on Wednesday, making Louisiana the first state in the US to require all public schools and universities to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\n\nConservative legal groups have been angling for another shot at reversing Supreme Court rulings protecting the separation of church and state after justices shot down a similar state law in Kentucky more than 30 years ago, on the grounds that the state violated the First Amendment's prohibition against any laws \"respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nIn 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that the public display of the Ten Commandments in two Kentucky county courthouses was similarly unconstitutional.\n\n\"Our public schools are not Sunday schools, and students of all faiths - or no faith - should feel welcome in them,\" the American Civil Liberties Union said in a joint statement with other civil rights groups warning against Louisiana's legislation.\n\nThe measure requires all schools to display the text exactly as written in the bill, and in \"a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches\" - at minimum - and \"in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nIt also requires a 200-word \"context statement\" arguing that the Ten Commandments were \"a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries\" up until 50 years ago.\n\nLast year, Louisiana's GOP-controlled state legislature passed a similar measure that requires \"In God We Trust\" displayed in all public school classrooms.\n\nGOP lawmakers in Texas, South Carolina and Utah recently tried to pass similar legislation that would put the Ten Commandments in public classrooms.\n\nThat rush of state-level legislation followed the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that loosened interpretations of the First Amendment's establishment clause to allow a high school football coach to pray with his team on the 50-yard line.\n\nJoseph Kennedy claimed that Washington state's Bremerton School District violated his religious freedom after staff repeatedly asked him to move his prayer to somewhere less conspicuous, as to avoid the appearance of the school's endorsement of a religious view.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that the Supreme Court \"continues to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state that the Framers fought to build.\"\n\nA coalition of Christian leaders and church goers in Louisiana said that the state \"has no business choosing an official version of the Ten Commandments, especially one that strips the text of its theological context.\"\n\n\"And the state certainly has no business mandating that this officially sanctioned version of the Ten Commandments be hung in every public school classroom, where teachers educate students who follow a broad array of Christian and non-Christian faith traditions,\" they wrote in a letter to Landry last month.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime-courts Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Following the state Senate's approval of the pertinent bill, only an amendment by the state house remains before it can be...\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom under a bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed Here are 13 must-visit restaurants in the St. Louis area from Ian Froeb's newsletter New Channel 32?

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts\n\nAP Breaking\n\nUnanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication\n\nBy MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Jun 13, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts\n\nAP Alert\n\nSupreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official\n\nBy LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press May 30, 2024\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts\n\nAP Alert\n\nSupreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district\n\nBy MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press May 23, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts\n\nAP Alert\n\nSupreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack\n\nBy MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press May 16, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nGovernment-politics\n\nBreaking\n\nSupreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack\n\nBy MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Mar 4, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nPolitics Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It reached Republican Gov. Jeff Landry's desk after receiving a final House approval in a 79-16 vote on May 28.\n\nThe measure was spearheaded by Republican state Rep. Dodie Horton. Last year, she successfully led a legislative effort to require the national motto \"In God We Trust\" to be displayed in classrooms across the state.\n\n\"If the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are to have any effect at all, it will be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments,\" the high court's 5-4 majority wrote at the time. \"However desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion, it is not a permissible state objective under the Establishment Clause.\"\n\nIn recent years, the Supreme Court appears to have become more open to a less restrictive interpretation of the Establishment Clause while placing greater emphasis on the country's history and tradition.\n\nIn defense of her Ten Commandments measure, Ms. Horton has highlighted the text's historical significance, arguing that the bill honors its unique place in Louisiana's history. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\n\"The Ten Commandments are the basis of all laws in Louisiana,\" she said on the House floor in April. \"And given all the junk our children are exposed to in classrooms today, it's imperative that we put the Ten Commandments back in a prominent position.\"\n\n\"It doesn't preach a certain religion, but it definitely shows what a moral code that we all should live by is,\" she said.\n\nLast year, the Texas Senate approved similar bill, however, it bill died after the House failed to vote on it before a deadline passed.\n\nA Utah bill, meanwhile, would have required all of the state's public schools to \"display a poster or framed copy\" of the Ten Commandments in a \"prominent location\" in every one of their buildings. The bill has since been changed to instead allow the biblical principles to be taught as part of school curricula.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodie_Horton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodie Horton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_We_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In God We Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing_and_Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing and Regulations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/23/id5656063-GettyImages-2399301-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665769", "eventUri": "eng-9665769", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 591, "textEnd": 597}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 703, "textEnd": 709}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nElections Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A lawsuit is already brewing.", "body": "Louisiana has become the first state in the U.S. to require public schools and universities to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom.\n\nGov. Jeff Landry signed House Bill 71 into law during a press conference Wednesday along with a slew of other laws focused on education, including another bill establishing an education savings account.\n\nThe new Ten Commandments law has been touted by state GOP leaders as a way to bring history, culture and traditions back to the classroom. Civil rights groups have decried the bill, arguing that it is a clear violation of the separation between church and state.\n\nTo that end, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation announced hours after Landry's press conference that they plan to sue over the law, which they said \"violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment.\"\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government,\" the groups said in a joint statement.\n\n\"Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\"\n\nWhat does the Ten Commandments law say?\n\nThe law requires all classrooms in Louisiana, from kindergarten to college level courses, to hang a poster or framed document of the Ten Commandments that is in large, easy-to-read font.\n\nThe incoming lawsuit was an expected move and one that Landry has welcomed publicly.\n\nDuring his keynote speech on Saturday at a Republican fundraiser in Tennessee, Landry touted the bill as a conservative victory in the ongoing culture wars and boasted that he \"can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nLawmakers made several changes to the bill to head off the potential viability of lawsuits, including adding references to past court rulings that allowed Ten Commandments displays in certain public spaces, adding a \"context statement\" to post alongside the Commandments and allowing schools to also display other historical documents, such as the Declaration of Independence.\n\nEfforts have been made in other GOP-led states like Texas and Oklahoma to pass a similar bill requiring the display of the Ten Commandments.

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime-courts Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

sued.\"\n\nLandry signed the bill into law on Wednesday, making Louisiana the first state in the US to require all public schools and universities to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\n\nConservative legal groups have been angling for another shot at reversing Supreme Court rulings protecting the separation of church and state after justices shot down a similar state law in Kentucky more than 30 years ago, on the grounds that the state violated the First Amendment's prohibition against any laws \"respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nIn 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that the public display of the Ten Commandments in two Kentucky county courthouses was similarly unconstitutional.\n\n\"Our public schools are not Sunday schools, and students of all faiths - or no faith - should feel welcome in them,\" the American Civil Liberties Union said in a joint statement with other civil rights groups warning against Louisiana's legislation.\n\nThe measure requires all schools to display the text exactly as written in the bill, and in \"a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches\" - at minimum - and \"in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nIt also requires a 200-word \"context statement\" arguing that the Ten Commandments were \"a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries\" up until 50 years ago.\n\nLast year, Louisiana's GOP-controlled state legislature passed a similar measure that requires \"In God We Trust\" displayed in all public school classrooms.\n\nGOP lawmakers in Texas, South Carolina and Utah recently tried to pass similar legislation that would put the Ten Commandments in public classrooms.\n\nThat rush of state-level legislation followed the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that loosened interpretations of the First Amendment's establishment clause to allow a high school football coach to pray with his team on the 50-yard line.\n\nJoseph Kennedy claimed that Washington state's Bremerton School District violated his religious freedom after staff repeatedly asked him to move his prayer to somewhere less conspicuous, as to avoid the appearance of the school's endorsement of a religious view.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that the Supreme Court \"continues to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state that the Framers fought to build.\"\n\nA coalition of Christian leaders and church goers in Louisiana said that the state \"has no business choosing an official version of the Ten Commandments, especially one that strips the text of its theological context.\"\n\n\"And the state certainly has no business mandating that this officially sanctioned version of the Ten Commandments be hung in every public school classroom, where teachers educate students who follow a broad array of Christian and non-Christian faith traditions,\" they wrote in a letter to Landry last month.", "source": {"uri":

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime-courts Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Louisiana is known for bringing in various changes in the education policy of its state but this the first time in the United States, the Ten Commandments of Moses will be displayed in all classrooms of public schools across Louisiana, says a USA Today report. Louisiana's Republican Governor Jeff Landry recently signed this new law on Wednesday, compelling every public school to follow suit and display the Commandments, which in bible, is often claimed as the 'laws of God'.\n\nThe Ten Commandments were one of the first consolidated form of laws by prophet Moses, and according to bible history, had to be followed by all believing in God. If these were not followed, God would banish them forever. Gov. Landry, during the signing of this historic bill said that respecting the rule of law means that one needs to start from the very beginning, that is, the original laws, given by Moses.\n\nThe Ten Commandments will now be seen across all Louisiana public schools, starting from the kindergarten level to state-funded universities, according to reports. It has also been mentioned that the installation of these displays of the Ten Commandments should be readily visible and should be available in 'large, visible font'.\n\nThis bill has been termed as unconstitutional by the opposition. However, Republicans are claiming that the Ten Commandments are actually a 'heritage' of the nation and speaks of its cultures, reforms and traditions, that have been followed for centuries now. Republicans are also pushing for passing a similar bill in other dominant States like Texas and Oklahoma, according to USA Today.\n\nWho gave the Ten Commandments?\n\nThe Ten Commandments is considered a holy scripture in the Bible, where Moses, a prophet, laid out the Ten Commandments, also considered the laws of God himself.\n\nHas Louisiana passed a new bill on the Ten Commandments?\n\nMoses' Ten Commandments will now be seen on display in every public classroom in Louisiana, according to a new law passed by a Republican Governor, amid much opposition.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prophet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religious text"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111121808,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-228134,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665769", "eventUri": "eng-9665769", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime-courts Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

She says the Ten Commandments offer historical context for Louisiana's laws, as the Sun reported. Yet critics, including state Senator Royce Duplessis, say the inevitable lawsuits will lead to a waste of \"valuable state resources\" over cases that the state will \"likely lose in court.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court in Stone v. Graham in 1980 held that displaying the Ten Commandments in schoolrooms was \"plainly religious in nature.\"\n\n\"The Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths,\" the court noted, adding that the Commandments \"do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters.\"\n\nThe court said posting religious commandments on the walls was different than teaching them in curriculum for history, religion, or similar subjects.\n\n\"Posting of religious texts on the wall serves no such educational function. If the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are to have any effect at all, it will be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments,\" the court wrote. \"However desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion, it is not a permissible state objective under the Establishment Clause.\"\n\nYet, recent Supreme Court decisions have taken a less strict stance on the Establishment Clause, sparking religious freedom debates across the country including over the legality of a Catholic charter school in Oklahoma.\n\nFor its part, Louisiana's leadership appears hungry for a constitutional debate.\n\n\"I'm going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms,\" Governor Landry said at a fundraising event last weekend, ahead of the bill becoming law. \"And I can't wait to be sued.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maggie_hroncich@nysun.com", "name": "Maggie Hroncich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Religious text"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. Her work has previously appeared on Variety, The New York Post, and The Wrap.\n\nLouisiana public schools will be required to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom per a new law.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill on Wednesday, June 19, reports the Associated Press and The New York Times.\n\nThe bill instructs educators to install a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in classrooms. This would be implemented in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. The posters are required to be in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the new bill argue that the signage's purpose is due to historical significance, not just religious significance. The Ten Commandments are described in the law as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nWhereas opponents of the bill expressed concern over the law's constitutionality, and have cautioned supporters that lawsuits will likely arise. Shortly after Landry signed the bill, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom From Religion Foundation stated there would be lawsuits challenging it in an ACLU press release.\n\n\"All students should feel safe and welcome in our public schools. H.B. 71 would undermine this critical goal and prevent schools from providing an equal education to all students, regardless of faith. We will not allow Louisiana lawmakers to undermine these religious-freedom rights,\" read the June 19 statement.\n\nAlongside the posters, there will be a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" per the Associated Press.\n\nDonations, not state funds, will be used to implement the law.\n\nTeachers in K-12 public schools are also now authorized, but not required, to display the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinances.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nLouisiana is the first state to successfully require the display of the Ten Commandments.

However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov.

Efforts to restore the commandments to public schools are active in other states, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah, although none so far have been successful.\n\nThe bill outlines that no state funding is to be used to place the Ten Commandments into public school classrooms -- rather, schools may accept donated funds to purchase displays, or accept donated displays.\n\n\"I'm going to organize an effort, and we will fund it,\" Dean Young told Breitbart News on Wednesday ahead of the bill's signing. Young is a Christian activist who has worked for 30 years to restore the Ten Commandments to classrooms across the United States.\n\n\"There will be a Ten Commandments for every single classroom in Louisiana, at LSU, at every college -- and it will be funded,\" Young continued.\n\nThe bill points to more recent decisions by the Supreme Court finding that the Ten Commandments \"have historical significance as one of the foundations of our legal system\" and represent a \"common cultural heritage.\" The bill further states that \"Recognizing the historical role of the Ten Commandments accords with our nation's history and faithfully reflects the understanding of the founders of our nation with respect to the necessity of civil morality to a function self-government.\"\n\n\"History records that James Madison, the fourth President of the United States of America, stated that '(w)e have staked the whole future of our new nation . . . upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments,\"' the bill reads.\n\nThe bill also allows, but does not require, the display of Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, and the Northwest Ordinance. The bill mandates that displays be paired with a four-paragraph context statement, in which the Ten Commandments are described as \"a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\" Public school classrooms from kindergarten to universities must have the displays no later than January 1, 2025.\n\nAlthough the bill did not receive a final approval from Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry (R), the time for him to either sign or veto the bill lapsed, allowing the legislation to go into effect, CBS News reported. Landry's office did not respond to Breitbart News's request for comment by time of publication.\n\nLocal media previously reported that Landry was supportive of the bill and even welcomed legal challenges to law.\n\n\"I'm going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms,\" Landry said during a speech on Saturday at a fundraiser in Tennessee. \"And I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nSo-called free speech groups have condemned the legislation as unconstitutional and a violation of separation of church and state.\n\n\"It is meant to impose Christianity on all students in Louisiana's public schools, even if they belong to a minority religion or no religion at all,\" The Center for Inquiry's director of government affairs Azhar Majeed wrote in a June 14 letter to Landry.\n\nThe Louisiana law comes after the Supreme Court decided in favor of a former Bremerton High School football coach who was fired for praying on the field. In that decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Coach Joe Kennedy's silent prayers on the field after games did not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court also struck down the \"Lemon test,\" which was used in the Supreme Court's 1980 Stone v. Graham decision to overturn a Kentucky law similar to the new one in Louisiana. The Lemon test was a measure of government coercion of religion that some justices had previously called outdated and misused.\n\n\"In place of Lemon and the endorsement test, this Court has instructed that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by 'reference to historical practices and understandings,'\" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion for Kennedy v. Bremerton School District.\n\nFocus on the Family's Nicole Hunt queried in an op-ed for Newsweek: \"Now, with the Lemon test officially rejected, it's fair to ask whether, under this alternative test based on 'historical practices and understandings,' a state could require a culturally and historically significant document, like the Ten Commandments, to be posted in public school classrooms.\"\n\nShe added:\n\nSome opponents of the Louisiana legislation argue that it violates the separation of church and state. This is a specious claim -- \"separation of church and state\" is never even mentioned in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe phrase comes from a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to a Baptist church association. The association expressed concern about being targeted by the government for persecution because it was a religious minority. Jefferson used the phrase \"separation of church and state\" in an attempt to assure people of faith that the Constitution would protect their religious liberty from government discrimination.\n\nIronically, Jefferson's words have since been used by individuals who seek to exclude religion from the public square to discriminate against people of faith.\n\nState Rep. Dodie Horton sponsored the legislation, and pointed to the 2022 Kennedy decision as part of her inspiration, Nola.com reported. Horton emphasized that her bill is not designed to indoctrinate students, but to provide \"guidelines.\" The Senate passed the bill 30-8 last month after it passed the state House.\n\n\"It doesn't preach a certain religion, but it does teach a standard,\" she said, adding that the Ten Commandments offer a moral code that God \"holds us accountable to live by.\"\n\nWhen asked what makes Louisiana's effort successful where other states have failed, Young told Breitbart News that strong state leadership plays a huge role.\n\n\"I think part of the reason is because, finally, there is a governor [and a legislature] who will stand up and do what's right...\" he said, adding:\n\nUntil 1980, the Ten Commandments were in all the schools, and [state leadership] realizes that all of this garbage that they're teaching these children about -- if you don't have a moral foundation, you get what we're getting today. If there's not right and wrong, and it's just everybody's opinion, then this is what happens: your society falls apart.\n\n\"They realize we have to get back to what this nation was founded on, and this nation was founded on a belief in God,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_hamilton@breitbart.com", "name": "Katherine Hamilton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lemon v.

Jeff Landry to veto a Republican-backed bill requiring the displays, becoming law without the governor's signature.\n\nHouse Bill 71, sponsored by Republican Rep. Dodie Horton, mandates that each public school classroom display a poster-sized copy of the Ten Commandments by next January. The Ten Commandments, as found in the Old Testament books of Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, are a set of ethical rules handed down by God to Moses.\n\nThe display must be a \"poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches,\" according to the text of the legislation. The text of the Ten Commandments must be the \"central focus\" of the poster or framed documents, which shall be printed in \"large, easily readable font.\"\n\nThe display must also include a four-paragraph \"context statement\" telling readers that \"The Ten Commandments were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\"\n\n\"Around the year 1688, The New England Primer became the first published American textbook and was the equivalent of a first grade reader. The New England Primer was used in public schools throughout the United States for more than one hundred fifty years to teach Americans to read and contained more than forty questions about the Ten Commandments,\" the context statement reads.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments were also included in public school textbooks published by educator William McGuffey, a noted university president and professor. A version of his famous McGuffey Readers was written in the early 1800s and became one of the most popular textbooks in the history of American education, selling more than one hundred million copies. Copies of the McGuffey Readers are still available today.\"\n\nThe new law is likely to face legal challenges. Secular church-state separation groups have already threatened lawsuits, contending that it violates the U.S. Constitution's Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation announced their intention to file a lawsuit.\n\nThe groups assert that school displays of the Ten Commandments equate to \"religious coercion of students, who are legally required to attend school and are thus a captive audience for school-sponsored religious messages.\"\n\nThe organizations believe the law violates U.S. Supreme Court precedent set in the 1980 Stone v. Graham decision. In a 5-4 ruling, the Burger court ruled against a similar law passed in Kentucky requiring classrooms to post copies of the Ten Commandments, finding that it violated the First Amendment.\n\n\"The law violates the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional,\" the groups wrote in a joint statement. \"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\"\n\nSupporters of the law maintain that its purpose is to highlight the document's historical significance, as the legislation describes the Ten Commandments as one of the \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe bill also allows schools to display other historical documents, such as the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance.\n\n\"Although this is a religious document, this document is also posted in over one hundred and eighty places, including the Supreme Court of the United States of America.

Jeff Landry signed the bill on Wednesday, June 19, reports the Associated Press and The New York Times.\n\nThe bill instructs educators to install a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in classrooms. This would be implemented in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. The posters are required to be in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the new bill argue that the signage's purpose is due to historical significance, not just religious significance.

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime-courts Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the groups said in a joint statement.\n\nSupporters of the law, in defending the measure, have leaned on the 2022 US Supreme Court decision in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, which gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field. The Supreme Court ruled that the coach's prayers amounted to private speech, protected by the First Amendment, and could not be restricted by the school district.\n\nThe decision lowered the bar between church and state in an opinion that legal experts predicted would allow more religious expression in public spaces. At the time, the court clarified that a government entity does not necessarily violate the establishment clause by permitting religious expression in public.\n\nLouisiana state Rep. Dodie Horton, the Republican author of the bill, said at the bill signing that \"it's like hope is in the air everywhere.\" Horton has dismissed concerns from Democratic opponents of the measure, saying the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \"moral code\" in the classroom.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime-courts Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThe displays, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nThe posters would be paid for through donations. State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime-courts Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024 0\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Jeff Landry signed legislation on Wednesday requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in every public classroom in Louisiana, making the state the only one with such a mandate and reigniting the debate over how porous the boundary between church and state should be.\n\nCritics, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, vowed a legal fight against the law they deemed \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nWhile signing the bill, Landry explained why it is so crucial:\n\nIf you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.\n\nHere are more details on the provisions of the education law:\n\nThe measure in Louisiana requires that the commandments be displayed in each classroom of every public elementary, middle and high school, as well as public college classrooms. The posters must be no smaller than 11 by 14 inches and the commandments must be \"the central focus of the poster\" and \"in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nIt will also include a three-paragraph statement asserting that the Ten Commandments were a \"prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\"\n\nThat reflects the contention by supporters that the Ten Commandments are not purely a religious text but also a historical document, arguing that the instructions handed down by God to Moses in the Book of Exodus are a major influence on United States law.\n\nWhile no lawsuits have been filed yet, progressive opponents of requiring the Ten Commandments in classrooms were quick to take a harsh tone over it being enacted:\n\nCritics said the legislation was a clear constitutional violation. In a joint statement, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Southern Poverty Law Center argued that the law \"violates students' and families' fundamental right to religious freedom.\"\n\n\"Our public schools are not Sunday schools,\" the statement said, \"and students of all faiths, or no faith, should feel welcome in them.\"\n\nBefore Wednesday's signing ceremony, Gov. Landry spoke at a Republican fundraiser on Saturday about the anticipated lawsuits--and he sounded ready for the challenge, saying \"I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

(Michael Smith/Getty Images)\n\nFour civil liberties groups will sue the state of Louisiana after Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed a law Wednesday that calls for the Ten Commandments to be displayed in school classrooms. The new rule applies to any school that accepts state money, including colleges and universities.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, its Louisiana chapter, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation announced they intend to file a lawsuit to block enforcement of House Bill 71. The measure, authored by Rep. Dodie Horton, R-Haughton, requires the Ten Commandments be displayed in each classroom. The poster or framed document dimensions must be at least 11 inches by 14 inches.\n\nSpeaking at a Republican Party fundraiser in Tennessee over the weekend, Landry said he intended to sign the Ten Commandments bill into law, \"and I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nThe four groups bringing the lawsuit issued a joint statement that said, in part, the new law promotes specific religious beliefs to which many people in Louisiana do not subscribe.\n\n\"All students should feel safe and welcome in our public schools,\" the statement said. \"H.B. 71 would undermine this critical goal and prevent schools from providing an equal education to all students, regardless of faith. We will not allow Louisiana lawmakers to undermine these religious-freedom rights.\"\n\nProponents of the legislation have argued it doesn't promote a specific religion because it does not allow public dollars to be used to purchase the Ten Commandments displays. Instead, schools can accept donated posters or documents, and the law directs the Louisiana Department of Education to \"identify appropriate resources to comply\" with the display requirements and list his information on its website.\n\nHorton also cast her proposal as a way to note the historical significance of the Ten Commandments and their role in American law.\n\nA recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling has also given confidence to backers of the new law.\n\nIn 2022, justices ruled in favor of Joseph Kennedy, a Washington state high school football coach who was fired for praying at midfield after games and allowing students to join him. Kennedy got his job back after conservative justices prevailed in a 6-3 decision, saying the post game prayers do not amount to a school endorsement of Christianity.\n\nMost important, according to supporters of the Ten Commandments law, the Kennedy decision did not rely on standards that have been applied since the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman. Known as the Lemon test, the principles are used to determine whether a law or government violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits any law and government action from standing up an official state religion.\n\nIn the Kennedy case, conservative justices looked at the history of rulings on the Establishment Clause and interpreted what they said was the intent of the Constitution's authors rather than rely on the Lemon test.\n\nThe ACLU and other plaintiffs in the anticipated lawsuit maintain Louisiana's law violates the long-standing precedent from Stone v. Graham, a 1980 ruling from the Supreme Court that overturned a similar statute approved in Kentucky. Justices decided then that the First Amendment bars public schools from posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\n\nLouisiana's K-12 schools, colleges and universities have until Jan. 1 to meet the law's requirements, although it doesn't include penalties for noncompliance.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_United_for_Separation_of_Church_and_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Americans United for Separation of Church and State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_From_Religion_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom From Religion Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Jeff Landry signed legislation on Wednesday requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in every public classroom in Louisiana, making the state the only one with such a mandate and reigniting the debate over how porous the boundary between church and state should be.\n\nCritics, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, have vowed a legal fight. But it is a battle that proponents are prepared, and in many ways, eager, to take on.\n\nThe legislation is part of a broader campaign by conservative Christian groups to amplify public expressions of faith, and provoke lawsuits that could reach the Supreme Court, where they expect a friendlier reception than in years past. That presumption is rooted in recent rulings, particularly one in 2022 in which the court sided with a high school football coach who argued that he had a constitutional right to pray at the 50-yard line after his team's games.\n\n\"The climate is certainly better,\" said Charles C. Haynes, a senior fellow at the Freedom Forum and a scholar with an expertise in religious liberty and civil discourse.\n\nStill, Mr. Haynes said that he found the enthusiasm behind the Louisiana legislation and other efforts unwarranted. \"I think they are overreaching,\" he said, adding that \"even this court will have a hard time justifying\" what lawmakers have conceived.\n\nThe measure in Louisiana requires that the commandments be displayed in each classroom of every public elementary, middle and high school, as well as public college classrooms. The posters must be no smaller than 11 by 14 inches and the commandments must be \"the central focus of the poster\" and \"in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nIt will also include a three-paragraph statement asserting that the Ten Commandments were a \"prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\"\n\nThat reflects the contention by supporters that the Ten Commandments are not purely a religious text but also a historical document, arguing that the instructions handed down by God to Moses in the Book of Exodus are a major influence on United States law.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments is there, time and time again, as the basis and foundation for the system that America was built upon,\" said Matt Krause, a lawyer for the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit legal organization defending religious expression.\n\nStill, as lawmakers debated the measure, its supporters argued that such a visible display was about more that just sharing legal history.\n\n\"Given all the junk our children are exposed to in classrooms today, it is imperative that we put the Ten Commandments back in a prominent position,\" said State Representative Dodie Horton, the Republican sponsor of the legislation.\n\nThe measure allows for \"our children to look up and see what God says is right and what he says is wrong,\" Ms. Horton told colleagues. \"It doesn't preach a certain religion, but it definitely shows what a moral code we all should live by is.\"\n\nCritics said the legislation was a clear constitutional violation. In a joint statement, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Southern Poverty Law Center argued that the law \"violates students' and families' fundamental right to religious freedom.\"\n\n\"Our public schools are not Sunday schools,\" the statement said, \"and students of all faiths, or no faith, should feel welcome in them.\"\n\nThe law is a product of a legislative season in which Republican lawmakers who had felt stifled for eight years under a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, sought to advance a flurry of conservative legislation to Mr. Landry, his Republican successor.\n\nIn a special session this year, lawmakers rolled back a previous overhaul of the criminal justice system and passed bills to lengthen sentences for some offenses, strictly limit access to parole, prosecute 17-year-olds charged with any crime as adults and allow methods of execution beyond lethal injection.\n\nLawmakers also advanced first-in-the-nation measures like designating abortion pills as dangerous controlled substances and allowing judges to order surgical castration of child sex offenders.\n\nLouisiana is the first state to enact a requirement for displaying the Ten Commandments in schools since the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law in 1980 that had a similar directive. In that case, Stone v. Graham, the court found that the law violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n\nBut the Supreme Court has become more likely to rule in favor of religious rights under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\n\nPerhaps the strongest signal, conservative lawyers and activists said, was the 2022 ruling that found that Joseph Kennedy, an assistant football coach at a public high school near Seattle, was protected by the First Amendment when he offered prayers after games, often joined by students.\n\nWith that ruling, the majority discarded a longstanding precedent known as the Lemon test, which was applied to cases related to the establishment clause of the First Amendment. (The clause is intended to \"prevent government from either advancing (that is, establishing) or hindering religion, preferring one religion over others, or favoring religion over nonreligion,\" Mr. Haynes wrote.)\n\nThe test required courts to consider whether the government practice being challenged had a secular purpose, whether its primary effect was to advance or inhibit religion, and whether it encouraged excessive government entanglement with religion.\n\nThe ruling was \"kind of an inflection point,\" Mr. Krause said, adding, \"I think that any decision that was based solely on the Lemon test is open to new scrutiny, whether that was graduation prayers or Nativity scenes on public lands or the Ten Commandments.\"\n\nThe Louisiana legislation -- and the litigation it essentially guarantees -- provides an opportunity to apply that scrutiny to public displays of the Ten Commandments.\n\nLegislative efforts in other states have had a bumpy path. Similar proposals failed recently in Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. One introduced in Utah this year was watered down to a measure that would add the Ten Commandments to a list of documents and principles that could be included in school curriculums.\n\nMr. Haynes of the Freedom Forum said he believed that the courts -- including the Supreme Court, if the cases ascends that high -- would see through the statements about historical context and recognize that the motivation was to inject religious teaching into public classrooms.\n\nIf the courts did not agree, he said, the result would amount to a catastrophic erosion in the divisions between government and religion.\n\n\"That would change who we are as a country, to go in that direction and have no barrier to government entanglement with religion,\" Mr. Haynes said. \"What would be left? What couldn't the government do?\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_rojas@nytimes.com", "name": "Rick Rojas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_From_Religion_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom From Religion Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Liberty_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Liberty Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodie_Horton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodie Horton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_United_for_Separation_of_Church_and_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americans United for Separation of Church and State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunday school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Exodus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Book of Exodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bel_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Bel Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religious text"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Education in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

According to the Associated Press, the law mandates that the posters be installed by the beginning of 2025.\n\nCritics have argued that the law is unconstitutional, and supporters claim the display serves a dual purpose: religious and historical. The Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\" Since the law requires that no state funds be used for this purpose, donations will fund the posters.\n\nRELATED STORIES: Shocking Video Shows Student Throw A Chair At Teacher's Head During A Classroom Fight\n\nAdditionally, the law provides for an optional display of other historical documents in K-12 schools, such as the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, and the Northwest Ordinance, so students develop an enriching understanding of American foundational texts. Major civil rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation, announced plans to challenge the law. They argued it could alienate students of diverse beliefs, threatening the neutrality of public education.\n\nThis law's opponents emphasize the variances in the text of the Ten Commandments across different religious denominations, criticizing the government's involvement in spiritual matters.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court cases of 2024\n\nReview key cases decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2024.\n\nCrime-courts AP Breaking Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court clears the way for the NRA's free speech lawsuit against an ex-New York official By LINDSAY WHITEHURST - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe unanimous opinion reverses a lower court decision tossing out the gun rights group's lawsuit against ex-New York State Department of Financial Services Ssuperintendent Maria Vullo.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court finds no bias against Black voters in a South Carolina congressional district By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nCrime-courts AP Alert Supreme Court sides with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spurning a conservative attack By MARK SHERMAN - Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected a conservative-led attack that could've undermined the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCrime-courts Breaking Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Updated Jun 14, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The commandments have to be the display's \"central focus\" and be \"printed in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nThe Louisiana House overwhelmingly passed the bill in April, and the state Senate followed suit in May. Both votes largely fell along party lines in the Republican-controlled chambers.\n\nCritics have vowed to challenge the law in court.\n\nThe Louisiana chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday that the requirement subjects students to \"unavoidable promotions of religious doctrine\" and prevents schools from providing an equal education to all students, regardless of faith.\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government,\" the ACLU said in a statement. \"Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\"\n\nThe Center for Inquiry, a nonprofit that advocates for a secular society, sent a letter to Landry on Friday, urging him to veto the bill. In response to reports that he planned to sign it, the group said becoming the first state to require the Ten Commandments to be posted in classrooms would be \"a dishonorable distinction.\"\n\nThe bill \"is an exclusionary, heavy-handed measure that will make every student who is a member of a minority religion (or no religion at all) feel like an outsider in their own school and virtually invite litigation at taxpayer expense,\" the center said in a statement.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Michael Bayham, one of the bill's authors, argued Wednesday that the law is not just about religion -- nor are the Ten Commandments.\n\n\"It's our foundational law. Our sense of right and wrong is based off of the Ten Commandments,\" he told The Washington Post, adding that Moses is a historical figure, and not just a religious one.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments is as much about civilization and right and wrong,\" Bayham said. \"It does not say you have to be this particular faith or that particular faith.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anumita_kaur@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Anumita Kaur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctrine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center for Inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irreligion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Studies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Tolerance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Tolerance", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RVJQQLD3XSQJ5F7B3NDDEDT4E4.JPEG&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665769", "eventUri": "eng-9665769", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 358, "textEnd": 364}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Jeff Landry signed a bill into law Wednesday that mandates the display of the Ten Commandments in all the state's public school classrooms.\n\nA poster-sized display with \"large, easily readable font\" must be placed in classrooms from kindergarten to state-funded universities, The Associated Press reported.\n\nProponents of the new law argued that the Ten Commandments have played a role beyond religion in forming the nation's laws and traditions.\n\nIn fact, the Louisiana law requires that a four-paragraph context statement be included with the display, explaining that the Commandments are part of \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nNo state funds are earmarked to be used in implementing the mandate. Instead, the posters can be paid through private donations.\n\nOpponents of the new law say it violates the Constitution, citing the First Amendment, which states, in part, that Congress shall \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation announced Wednesday they would be filing a suit to challenge the new law.\n\nThey pointed to the 1980 Supreme Court case Stone v. Graham, in which the justices ruled that a Kentucky law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms violated the First Amendment's establishment clause.\n\nHowever, at that time the Court cited the so-called Lemon test to determine whether a law had the effect of establishing a religion.\n\nIn the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman, the justices had adopted the following analysis: \"First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion ... finally the statute must not foster 'an excessive government entanglement with religion.'\"\n\nKentucky, like Louisiana, had required the displays to explain the historical importance of the Commandments, and they were financed through private donations.\n\nThe Court applied the Lemon test to the Kentucky law and decided, \"The pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in nature.\"\n\n\"The Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths and no legislative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact. The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder, adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness,\" the justices continued.\n\n\"Rather, the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: worshiping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.\"\n\nBut conservative Justice William Rehnquist argued in a dissent, \"The Court rejects the secular purpose articulated by the State because the Decalogue [another name for the Ten Commandments] is 'undeniably a sacred text,' ... It is equally undeniable, however, as the elected representatives of Kentucky determined, that the Ten Commandments have had a significant impact on the development of secular legal codes of the Western World.\"\n\nRehnquist went on to contend, \"The Establishment Clause does not require that the public sector be insulated from all things which may have a religious significance or origin. This Court has recognized that 'religion has been closely identified with our history and government,'\" quoting from the 1963 Abington School District v. Schempp.\n\nThat Court ruled in that case that mandatory Bible reading in the classroom was unconstitutional, but the justices noted \"it might well be said that one's education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court abandoned the Lemon test in the 2022 case Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, determining the establishment clause \"must be interpreted by 'reference to historical practices and understandings.' \"\n\nSo it appears the Louisiana Ten Commandments display would have a good chance of being ruled constitutional under this guidance.\n\nAt its core is the belief that a just God, as revealed in the Bible, governs over the affairs of this world, and he has established timeless divine laws -- the \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" -- that create corresponding inalienable rights, as stated in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe pre-eminent law book at the time of the founding, Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Law of England,\" lays all this out well.\n\n\"Upon these two foundations, the law of nature [established by God and observable in creation] and the law of revelation [found in the Bible, directly revealed by God], depend all human laws; that is to say, no human laws should be suffered to contradict these,\" Blackstone wrote.\n\nAs I explained in my book \"We Hold These Truths,\" the Ten Commandments create the right to life (\"You shall not murder\") and the right to own property (\"You shall not steal\").\n\nThe commandment not to covet your neighbor's house \"or anything that is your neighbor's\" is also a recognition of the right to own property and a rebuke to the central tenet of socialism: Use the force of government to spread the wealth around.\n\nAnother commandment, \"You shall not bear false witness,\" creates the right not to be falsely accused of a crime (which, of course, would result in the loss of one's life, liberty or property). The right to due process of law is designed to protect the accused from false allegations.\n\nThe commandment to \"honor your father and your mother\" establishes the central role of family in society and that there are two genders.\n\nThe family is also delineated in the book of Genesis and reaffirmed by Jesus Christ in the New Testament: \"Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.\"\n\nSo the Ten Commandments are very important to the nation's legal history and worthy of study and placement in the classroom.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "randy_desoto@westernjournal.com", "name": "Randy DeSoto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lemon v.

The high court ruled the law blurred the line between church and state.\n\nOn Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union announced plans to sue, claiming Louisiana's new law also violates the First Amendment.\n\n\"We are preparing a lawsuit to challenge H.B. 71. The law violates the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional,\" the ACLU said in a statement.\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the ACLU added.\n\nGov.

Instances of sexual assault are swept under the carpet.\n\nThere are grade schools that use the popular \"Genderbread Person,\" which helps students understand that they can \"identify with a gender\" other than the one \"assigned to them\" at birth.\n\nThe website of an elementary school in Bellevue, Washington, promises parents that their children \"will have explicit conversations about race, equity and access,\" and \"will identify culture and begin to recognize and identify white culture,\" in all of its depravity and wickedness.\n\nIn Lexington, Massachusetts. fourth graders are taught to \"articulate what gender identity is and why it's important to use nonbinary language in describing people we don't know yet.\" Mind your pronouns!\n\nThis week, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against an eighth grader in Middleborough, Massachusetts, whose school wouldn't let him wear a T-shirt with the slogan \"There are only two genders.\" Public education's established religion doesn't like competition.\n\nHalf of America's high school students and almost 40% of middle schoolers are subjected to \"comprehensive sexuality education,\" which is graphic to the point of being pornographic and promotes high-risk sexual behavior and unrestricted access to abortion.\n\nStudents are subjected to all of this, but the ACLU and its allies would have us believe that seeing the words of God on a small poster will irreparably damage tender psyches.\n\nMorgan Foster (not her real name) taught English in Cook County, Illinois, schools for over 10 years.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Ms. Foster charged that \"public schools have become indoctrination centers.\" The Black teacher said that administrators were removing the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Hemingway because they regarded them as promoting White privilege and supporting the patriarchy.\n\nYou can see the problems Ten Commandments posters would create in this bizarre environment. Mosaic law does not endorse the LGBTQ agenda or excuse discrimination based on past injustice.\n\nReminding students that there is something higher than the academic fads of the day is dangerous. Those \"thou shalts\" and \"thou shalt nots\" threaten the orthodoxy of government schools.\n\nThe religion of public education is helping to turn America into a jungle of homelessness, addiction and crime.\n\nWe need the Ten Commandments more now than ever. The carnage in our streets does not come from teaching divine law.\n\nThis column was first published at the Washington Times.", "source": {"uri": "wnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WND"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_United_for_Separation_of_Church_and_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Americans United for Separation of Church and State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoctrination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indoctrination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunday school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

And on Wednesday, as he signed the measure, he argued that the Ten Commandments contained valuable lessons for students.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law,\" he said, \"you've got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.\"\n\nThe legislation is part of a broader campaign by conservative Christian groups to amplify public expressions of faith and provoke lawsuits that could reach the Supreme Court, where they expect a friendlier reception than in years past. That presumption is rooted in recent rulings, particularly one in 2022 in which the court sided with a high school football coach who argued that he had a constitutional right to pray at the 50-yard line after his team's games.\n\n\"The climate is certainly better,\" said Charles C. Haynes, a senior fellow at the Freedom Forum and a scholar with an expertise in religious liberty and civil discourse, referring to the viewpoint of those who support the legislation.\n\nStill, Haynes said that he found the enthusiasm behind the Louisiana law and other efforts unwarranted. \"I think they are overreaching,\" he said, adding that \"even this court will have a hard time justifying\" what lawmakers have conceived.\n\nThe measure in Louisiana requires that the commandments be displayed in each classroom of every public elementary, middle, and high school, as well as public college classrooms. The posters must be no smaller than 11 by 14 inches and the commandments must be \"the central focus of the poster\" and \"in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nIt will also include a three-paragraph statement asserting that the Ten Commandments were a \"prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\"\n\nThat reflects the contention by supporters that the Ten Commandments are not purely a religious text but also a historical document, arguing that the instructions handed down by God to Moses in the Book of Exodus are a major influence on US law.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments is there, time and time again, as the basis and foundation for the system that America was built upon,\" said Matt Krause, a lawyer for the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit legal organization defending religious expression.\n\nStill, as lawmakers debated the measure, its supporters argued that such a visible display was about more than just sharing legal history.\n\n\"Given all the junk our children are exposed to in classrooms today, it is imperative that we put the Ten Commandments back in a prominent position,\" said state Representative Dodie Horton, the Republican sponsor of the legislation.\n\nThe measure allows for \"our children to look up and see what God says is right and what he says is wrong,\" Horton told colleagues. \"It doesn't preach a certain religion, but it definitely shows what a moral code we all should live by is.\"\n\nCritics said the legislation was a clear constitutional violation. In a joint statement, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Southern Poverty Law Center argued that the law \"violates students' and families' fundamental right to religious freedom.\"\n\n\"Our public schools are not Sunday schools,\" the statement said, \"and students of all faiths, or no faith, should feel welcome in them.\"\n\nThe law is a product of a legislative season in which Republican lawmakers who had felt stifled for eight years under a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, sought to advance a flurry of conservative legislation to Landry, his Republican successor.\n\nLouisiana is the first state to enact a requirement for displaying the Ten Commandments in schools since the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law in 1980 that had a similar directive. In that case, Stone v. Graham, the court found that the law violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n\ng one religion over others, or favoring religion over", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tennessean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tennessean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Exodus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Book of Exodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religious text"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Education in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Amid threats of legal challenges, however, Louisiana is the only state so far to have taken action along those lines.\n\nThere is precedent for measures like these being successfully challenged in the courts, with a 1980 Supreme Court case finding that a similar law in Kentucky violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, the AP reported.\n\nThe mandate is set to begin in 2025, according to the AP.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe displays, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nThe posters would be paid for through donations. State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\nNotable Supreme Court

Graham that a Kentucky law on the posting of the Ten Commandments in school was unconstitutional.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hebrew language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prophet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe displays, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nThe posters would be paid for through donations. State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nIt's a serious debate....\n\nDo you agree with the move?\n\nDoes this comply with Religious Freedom in the First Amendment?\n\nIs it a slippery slope?\n\nOr just plain good news?\n\nRELATED POST:\n\nEXPOSED: The United Nations 10 Commandments of Climate Change\n\nYes, you read that headline right.\n\nThe left seems to be uncontent with simply killing babies, hating Christians and all of their other normal hobbies.\n\nThey've now taken it up a notch to actively disrespect the Bible.\n\nYou know, good old \"Sacrilege\".\n\nMocking the Bible seems to be a poor idea.\n\nThe Bible is the Word of God.\n\nJesus said he was The Word.\n\nSo you mock the Bible you take on Jesus head-on.\n\nDoesn't seem like something you'd want to do, but that's just me!\n\nTo each their own I guess.\n\nI mean, these sure look like some good, definitely non-loser people....\n\nI'll show you a video in just a minute.\n\nBut here's the story...\n\nA group a multiple different faiths has gotten together to attack the #1 problem plaguing us all.\n\nVoter fraud?\n\nNo.\n\nBig city murders?\n\nNo.\n\nSin?\n\nNo.\n\nHomeless people overrunning a once-beautiful California?\n\nNo.\n\nLook, we could be here a while, let me just tell you: CLIMATE CHANGE!\n\nDuh!\n\nWe have to stop Climate Change!\n\nHow many times does Al Gore have to tell you?\n\nAfter all, the icebergs and polar ice caps were supposed to be totally GONE by the year 2000, so you can only imagine how bad they must be now in 2022...\n\nWe were all supposed to be dead and the planet a supernova in 2005 basically from global warming, so it's a miracle I'm even here on the face of this great Earth typing this!\n\nAll sarcasm aside, this is a real story and this is how these people have chosen to spend their time.\n\nBut I don't blame them.\n\nThis is obviously orchestrated by people like the Mother WEFers, the United Nations and all their friends.\n\nOne big publicity stunt.\n\nFor them, it's a win-win-win...\n\nMock God, get some attention, and push the money-laundering agenda that you have to pay them taxes for something totally made up and fake!\n\nA trifecta!\n\nI'm really ranting here, let me show you some details.\n\nSo not only did they create 10 Blasphemous Commandments, but they travelled to a Holy Site to deliver them.\n\nTHEN....they smashed them, just like Moses did.\n\nI bet you not one person in this whole group even knows the details behind WHY Moses smashed those 10 Commandments.\n\nI love this comment:\n\nAnyway, here's more:\n\nHere are all 10, if you care to read blasphemy:\n\nHow charming.\n\nFrom the JPost:\n\nAn Israeli climate activist smashed tablets representing the 10 climate change principles, mirroring Moses's smashing of the biblical commandments, in a demonstration against climate crisis inaction atop Jebel Musa, the mountain thought by many to be Sinai. The event, published in a YouTube video published last Sunday, took place in protest of the COP 27 climate conference taking place in Sharm el Sheikh.\n\nThe tablets, which read \"keep your promises\" in Hebrew, represented the 10 Spiritual Principles for Climate Repentance. The principles, which were developed by interfaith leaders at the Elijah Board of World Religious Leaders in the proceeding days, were read aloud before the tablets were smashed.\n\n\"Climate promises have not been kept worldwide, including in Israel.\"\n\nYosef Abramowitz and other activists said that they acted in response to a lack of action from the world's governments to reduce global emissions and fight climate change.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" Abramowitz lamented before smashing the first tablet, \"Climate promises have not been kept worldwide, including in Israel.\"\n\nAbramowitz said that \"when it comes to the leaders of the world who are gathering at COP 27: there's a lot of talk, there's some action, but there's not enough to be able to keep the world to one and a half degrees on the warming. The whole world needs to cut our emissions by half by 2030, and they're not yet. We take these Green Commandments, we look down to Sharm El-Sheikh, and we're not satisfied,\" Abramowitz declared before proceeding to smash the second tablet.\n\nIn addition to expressing disappointment for the governments of the world in general, Abramowitz had a message for the government of Israel.\n\n\"Gas is 3 times more expensive than solar power in Israel, so if you want to lower the cost of living and be part of the international climate consensus, up your goals from 30% to 50% renewables by 2030,\" he said.\n\nOriginally, the activists intended to bring dozens of multifaith leaders to the mountain for the ceremony, but Egyptian authorities prevented them from doing so.\n\nNevertheless, Abramowitz and other activists were able to conduct the ceremony. During the same week, other demonstrations took place on mountaintops. Additionally, the 10 climate principles were read in a live stream from Parliament Hill in Ottawa.\n\nCOP climate conference and protests\n\nSharm el Sheikh, the Egyptian host city of the COP 27 climate conference, located in the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, is roughly 100 miles from Jebel Musa.\n\nIt's not the first time climate activists have gone to protest the annual UN climate conference. Last year during the COP 26 conference in Glasgow, Scotland, teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg criticized the event.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, she said, \"Nothing has changed from previous years really. The leaders will say we'll do this... and then they will do nothing... We can have as many COPs as we want, but nothing real will come out of it.\"\n\nWant my take on \"Green\"?\n\nIt's an interesting topic.\n\nFrom a Biblical perspective, it does feel wrong to show no concern for the planet.\n\nAfter all, God created it and then he placed Adam in charge to be its steward.\n\nSo there is an element of stewardship.\n\nBut that's as far as I go.\n\nI don't ascribe to the theory that the planet is doomed and only WE can help it.\n\nSorry folks, the Bible actually says this entire place is going to be burned up and a new Heaven and Earth created.\n\nWe are not to worship this Earth.\n\nWe are not to assume that we can protect it forever.\n\nBecause you can't.\n\nIt will last for as long as God wants it to last, and then the Book of Revelation clearly tells us at some point it will be swallowed up and consumed and a new Heaven and new Earth will take it's place.\n\nAnd no amount of Climate Tax is going to stop that, I can assure you!\n\nSo my take is be good stewards of the land when we can.\n\nDon't be wasteful.\n\nDon't be purposely destructful.\n\nTake care of it by employing things like good farming techniques, etc.\n\nBut beyond that?\n\nI don't go much beyond that.\n\nI stick with a Biblical view and I DEFINITELY do not worship the creation.\n\nWorshipping the Earth has a name, did you know that?\n\nThey call it \"Gaia\" and worshipping the Earth is \"Gaia Worship\".\n\nI bet you've seen that name before and if not you will in the future.\n\nAny time you see that, you should RUN in the other direction!\n\nNow back to our story....\n\nHere is the whole group conducting their blasphemous ritual.\n\nWatch if you can stomach it:\n\nInterestingly enough, this isn't the first time this has been tried.\n\nThe Pope announced his own Climate Change Commandments about 8 years ago:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/1andOnlyBAbbott/status/1594573242186039300\n\nFrom CNN:\n\nPope Francis released a sweeping statement about the environment on Thursday, calling for \"cultural revolution\" to change our lifestyles - from our addiction to technology to our treatment of the poor.\n\nThe document is very long - 184 pages in English. But here are 10 quick commandments the Pope says everybody can follow to stop the \"disturbing warming\" of our planet.\n\n1. Think of future generations.\n\nPope Encyclical 1\n\n2. Embrace alternative energy sources.\n\nPope Encyclical 2\n\n3. Consider pollution's effect on the poor.\n\nPope Encyclical 3\n\n4. Take the bus!\n\nPope Encyclical 4\n\n5. Be humble.\n\nPope Encyclical 5 b\n\n6. Don't become a slave to your phone.\n\nPope Encyclical 6\n\n7. Don't trade online relationships for real ones.\n\nPope Encyclical 7\n\n8. Turn off the lights, recycle and don't waste food.\n\nPope Encyclical 8 b\n\n9. Educate yourself.\n\nPope Encyclical 9 b\n\n10. Believe you can make a difference.\n\nPope Encyclical 10\n\nI don't know why, but it absolutely cracks me up that #4 is \"Take The Bus\".\n\nHow long did you work on that one Pontiff?\n\nThis Pope is a dope!\n\nAnd that's the NICEST thing I can say about him.\n\nSave your emails, Catholics, I don't want to hear them.\n\nMeanwhile, here is yet ANOTHER reason I love President Trump:\n\nPresident Trump: \"We Have To Defeat The Climate Hoaxsters!\"\n\nPresident Trump is taking \"woke\" head on.\n\nAnd peak woke is the climate hoax, which is really just another way to extort money from the American people.\n\nThis is one of his best clips, watch here:\n\nHe's 100% right!\n\nAlways fighting for America.\n\nThe scam has been exposed:\n\nAnd:\n\nI love this:\n\nThank you Jim for your honesty here:\n\nNow let's go deeper...\n\nHave you heard of this?\n\nBlood and Gore: The Untold Story Behind Al Gore's Carbon Tax Company\n\nYou'd think I were making this up, but sadly I'm not.\n\nRemember the whole Carbon Tax thing that Obama and the Dems were pushing?\n\nLiterally a tax on the air.\n\nFunny, who is described in the Bible as the Prince of the Air?\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nRemember that?\n\nWell, here's the part I bet you didn't know.\n\nAl Gore was deep into it and had even formed a company with his friend David Blood to capitalize on the new Carbon Tax.\n\nYup, that's right.\n\nThe Blood and Gore company.\n\nYou just CAN'T make this stuff up folks!\n\nAnd in case you think I'm making it up, I've got a link to a Forbes article below to show you it's sadly very real.\n\nFirst, take a look at this:\n\nHere are all the details folks, from Forbes no less:\n\nSurprise! Al Gore and his carbon credit huckstering partner David Blood, both principals at Generation Investment Management (GIM), warn in their October 30 Wall Street Journal op/ed feature of peril to fossil fuel investments due to \"The Coming Carbon Asset Bubble\". They argue that such \"unwise and increasingly wreck less\" investment strategies pose three broad risks which will cause carbon assets to become \"stranded\" and lose economic value: through direct government carbon regulation; as a result of market-share losses to \"already competitive\" renewable technologies; and due to \"sociopolitical pressures\" causing carbon-intensive businesses to lose their \"license to operate\".\n\nMarketing Climate Alarm:\n\nOf course this carbon regulation is posited upon saving the Earth based upon a \"consensus within the scientific community that increasing the global temperature by more than 2oC will likely cause devastating and irreversible damage to the planet.\" And where it comes to promulgating and capitalizing upon carbon-climate-crazed sociopolitical pressure, you would be hard-pressed to find two better authorities.\n\nGore and Blood, the former chief of Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), co-founded London-based GIM in 2004. Between 2008 and 2011 the company had raised profits of nearly $218 million from institutions and wealthy investors. By 2008 Gore was able to put $35 million into hedge funds and private partnerships through the Capricorn Investment Group, a Palo Alto company founded by his Canadian billionaire buddy Jeffrey Skoll, the first president of EBay Inc. It was Skoll's Participant Media that produced Gore's feverishly frightening 2006 horror film, \"An Inconvenient Truth\".\n\nIn 2007, following an investigation of the movie, Sir Michael Burton, a judge in London's High Court, ruled that it can be shown in secondary schools only if accompanied by guidance notes for teachers to balance Mr. Gore's \"one-sided\" views. Judge Barton pointed out that its \"apocalyptical vision\" was politically partisan, and not an impartial analysis. He stated: \"It is built around the charismatic presence of the ex-vice president Al Gore, whose crusade is to persuade the world of the dangers of climate change caused by global warming...It is now common ground that this is not simply a science film- although it is based substantially on science research and opinion, but it is [clearly] a political film.\"\n\nAs for taking their recent investment advice, it might be worth mentioning that some of GIM's earlier low-carbon deals haven't always worked out so great.\n\nOptimistic that a Democrat-controlled Congress would pass cap-and-trade legislation Gore lobbied for, GIM and David Blood's old GSAM firm took big stakes in the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) for carbon trading. Accordingly, CCX was poised to make windfall profits selling CO2 offsets if and when cap-and-trade was passed. Speaking before a 2007 Joint House Hearing of the Energy Science Committee, Gore told members: \"As soon as carbon has a price, you're going to see a wave [of investment] in it...There will be unchained investment.\"\n\nAfter all, what better way to reduce evil carbon than to make it a profitable commodity? But unfortunately for GIM and CCX investors, trading hot air credits proved just too good to be true.\n\nBetween May of 2008 and October of 2009 the CCX market value for one metric ton of carbon plummeted from $7 per metric ton to $0.10 along with the shareholders' investment values. Losers included the Ford Motor Company, Amtrak, DuPont, Dow Corning, American Electric Power, International Paper, and Waste Management, along with the states of Illinois and New Mexico, seven cities, and a number of universities.\n\nBy 2010, GIM approximately doubled a 9.6% stake it had purchased in Camco International Ltd., a manager of products to limit greenhouse gases. But by October of that year disaster struck again. Republicans took control of the House, dashing all cap-and-capitalize hopes along with huge profit prospects for either Camco or CCX. The latter shut down operations in November of that year.\n\nOn top of that bad news, First Solar Inc., another GIM investment, got squeezed out of the solar panel market by cheaper Chinese products. According to Bloomberg, GIM dumped its last First Solar stock at a $165.9 million loss in 2012.\n\nYou can read the entire story here.\n\nAnd you'll love this....\n\nFrom the Generation Investment Management website itself, you'll never guess their address....it's located on Air Street!\n\nAs I continually say as I shake my head, you just can't make this stuff up!\n\nThey're laughing at us....\n\nLook:\n\nAlso from their website, just in case you think I'm somehow making this all up, here they are so proudly together:\n\nHere's a full breakdown:\n\nMore on the Climate Scam here:\n\nBill Gates Says The World Is Ending Due To Climate Change\n\nOh, here we go again!\n\nAnother \"the world is ending\" prediction by another creepy \"elite\".\n\nWho is it today?\n\nGreta Thunberg?\n\nAl Gore?\n\nJohn Kerry?\n\nAll good guesses.\n\nNope!\n\nIt's that depopulation freak, Bill Gates!\n\nApparently, being obsessed with pandemics isn't enough for Gates, he's now moved on to pushing \"climate change\" down our throats.\n\nTake a look:\n\nRaise your hand if you don't give a damn what this guy thinks?\n\nActually, I take that back.\n\nRaise your hand if you think the safest thing for humanity is to do the EXACT OPPOSITE of whatever this creep is pushing?\n\nFrom Fox News:\n\nMicrosoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates warned that there will be dire consequences if the world does not achieve zero net carbon emissions by the year 2050.\n\nIn his new book, \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,\" Gates says that it is imperative that the world go from the current 51 billion tons of emissions to zero within the next 30 years to avoid catastrophe.\n\n\"The migration that we saw out of Syria for their civil war, which was somewhat weather dependent, we're going to have 10 times as much migration because the equatorial areas will become unlivable,\" Gates told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace, warning what will happen if the goal is not reached. \"We won't be able to farm or go outside during the summer. Wildfires, even the farming productivity in the south of the U.S. - the droughts - will reduce productivity in the area dramatically.\"\n\nGates went on to say that the loss of life would be greater than even the worst part of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"The instability overall will be five times as many deaths at the peak of the pandemic and going up every year,\" he said.\n\nWhile 2050 is Gates' cutoff point, he said this is really just a matter of \"degree.\"\n\n\"If we wait 10 more years it's not as bad as if we wait 20 or we wait 30, because the temperature just keeps going up,\" he said. Gates said he is looking at 2050 because it \"happens to be the soonest realistic date for the world to change all of these sorts of emissions.\"\n\nGates defended himself against criticisms from the left and right. Those on the left claim that he is not going far enough, and that he needs to support the Green New Deal, with efforts to reduce net emissions to zero by 2030.\n\n\"It's completely unrealistic,\" Gates said about the 2030 goal, saying that it will take at least 30 years to accomplish this.\n\nGates has also gotten flack for talking about the need to reduce emissions while he himself has a tremendous carbon footprint by living in a large home and flying on a private jet. He said his other actions make up for this.\n\n\"I am offsetting my carbon emissions by buying clean aviation fuel, and funding carbon capture and funding low-cost housing projects to use electricity instead of natural gas,\" Gates said. He noted how expensive these efforts have been and said those costs must be driven down.\n\nBill, you are a massive creep and in my estimation extremely dangerous to the human population.\n\nBut let's set that aside for a minute.\n\nLet's take a moment to enjoy all the \"World Is Ending\" predictions that have never happened.\n\nWhen will we stop falling for it?\n\nAnd what is this \"offsetting my carbon\" BS?\n\nDoes anyone have critical thinking skills anymore?\n\nIt's ok for Gates and Kerry and all these losers to fly their private jets constantly all over the world as long as they buy some carbon credits in some stock market?\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nLet's assume for a moment that climate change is real and a big problem (I'm not in agreement, but let's assume) and so let's say your burning all sorts of carbon with your jets....and buying some piece of paper on a stock market is going to somehow fix that?\n\nHow stupid do they think we are?\n\nActually....sadly, they think we are VERY stupid.\n\nBecause they just keep running the same lame play time and time again and we fall for it every time.\n\nTake a look:\n\nThen I found this incredible list from AIE.org:\n\nBelow are the 41 failed doomsday, eco-pocalyptic predictions (with links):\n\n1. 1967: Dire Famine Forecast By 1975\n\n2. 1969: Everyone Will Disappear In a Cloud Of Blue Steam By 1989 (1969)\n\n3. 1970: Ice Age By 2000\n\n4. 1970: America Subject to Water Rationing By 1974 and Food Rationing By 1980\n\n5. 1971: New Ice Age Coming By 2020 or 2030\n\n6. 1972: New Ice Age By 2070\n\n7. 1974: Space Satellites Show New Ice Age Coming Fast\n\n8. 1974: Another Ice Age?\n\n9. 1974: Ozone Depletion a 'Great Peril to Life (data and graph)\n\n10. 1976: Scientific Consensus Planet Cooling, Famines imminent\n\n11. 1980: Acid Rain Kills Life In Lakes (additional link)\n\n12. 1978: No End in Sight to 30-Year Cooling Trend (additional link)\n\n13. 1988: Regional Droughts (that never happened) in 1990s\n\n14. 1988: Temperatures in DC Will Hit Record Highs\n\n15. 1988: Maldive Islands will Be Underwater by 2018 (they're not)\n\n16. 1989: Rising Sea Levels will Obliterate Nations if Nothing Done by 2000\n\n17. 1989: New York City's West Side Highway Underwater by 2019 (it's not)\n\n18. 2000: Children Won't Know what Snow Is\n\n19. 2002: Famine In 10 Years If We Don't Give Up Eating Fish, Meat, and Dairy\n\n20. 2004: Britain will Be Siberia by 2024\n\n21. 2008: Arctic will Be Ice Free by 2018\n\n22. 2008: Climate Genius Al Gore Predicts Ice-Free Arctic by 2013\n\n23. 2009: Climate Genius Prince Charles Says we Have 96 Months to Save World\n\n24. 2009: UK Prime Minister Says 50 Days to 'Save The Planet From Catastrophe'\n\n25. 2009: Climate Genius Al Gore Moves 2013 Prediction of Ice-Free Arctic to 2014\n\n26. 2013: Arctic Ice-Free by 2015 (additional link)\n\n27. 2014: Only 500 Days Before 'Climate Chaos'\n\n28. 1968: Overpopulation Will Spread Worldwide\n\n29. 1970: World Will Use Up All its Natural Resources\n\n30. 1966: Oil Gone in Ten Years\n\n31. 1972: Oil Depleted in 20 Years\n\n32. 1977: Department of Energy Says Oil will Peak in 1990s\n\n33. 1980: Peak Oil In 2000\n\n34. 1996: Peak Oil in 2020\n\n35. 2002: Peak Oil in 2010\n\n36. 2006: Super Hurricanes!\n\n37. 2005 : Manhattan Underwater by 2015\n\n38. 1970: Urban Citizens Will Require Gas Masks by 1985\n\n39. 1970: Nitrogen buildup Will Make All Land Unusable\n\n40. 1970: Decaying Pollution Will Kill all the Fish\n\n41. 1970s: Killer Bees!\n\nUpdate: I've added 9 additional failed predictions (via Real Climate Science) below to make it an even 50 for the number of failed eco-pocalyptic doomsday predictions over the last 50 years.\n\n42. 1975: The Cooling World and a Drastic Decline in Food Production\n\n43. 1969: Worldwide Plague, Overwhelming Pollution, Ecological Catastrophe, Virtual Collapse of UK by End of 20th Century\n\n44. 1972: Pending Depletion and Shortages of Gold, Tin, Oil, Natural Gas, Copper, Aluminum\n\n45. 1970: Oceans Dead in a Decade, US Water Rationing by 1974, Food Rationing by 1980\n\n46. 1988: World's Leading Climate Expert Predicts Lower Manhattan Underwater by 2018\n\n47. 2005: Fifty Million Climate Refugees by the Year 2020\n\n48. 2000: Snowfalls Are Now a Thing of the Past\n\n49.1989: UN Warns That Entire Nations Wiped Off the Face of the Earth by 2000 From Global Warming\n\n50. 2011: Washington Post Predicted Cherry Blossoms Blooming in Winter\n\nBut somehow this time will be different, and the 'experts' and 16-year olds of today will suddenly be correct in their new predictions of eco-doom and eco-disaster?

Jeff Landry, H.B. 71 requires schools to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom on \"a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches.\" The Commandments must be the \"central focus\" of the display and \"printed in a large, easily readable font.\" The bill also requires that a specific version of the Ten Commandments, which has been dictated by the state legislature, be used for every display. Displays that depart from this state-sanctioned version of scripture would violate Louisiana law.\n\nThe law violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment. More than 40 years ago, in Stone v. Graham, the Supreme Court overturned a similar state statute, holding that the First Amendment bars public schools from posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms. No other state requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public schools.\n\nThe displays mandated by H.B. 71 will result in unconstitutional religious coercion of students, who are legally required to attend school and are thus a captive audience for school-sponsored religious messages. They will also send a chilling message to students and families who do not follow the state's preferred version of the Ten Commandments that they do not belong, and are not welcome, in our public schools.\n\nIn response to the passage of H.B. 71, the groups intending to challenge the law issued the following joint statement:\n\nWe are preparing a lawsuit to challenge H.B. 71. The law violates the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional. The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\n\nLouisiana's communities and public schools are religiously diverse, yet H.B. 71 would require school officials to promote specific religious beliefs to which people of many faiths, and those of no faith, do not subscribe. Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate, and it certainly should not be coercing students to submit day in and day out to unavoidable promotions of religious doctrine.\n\nAll students should feel safe and welcome in our public schools. H.B. 71 would undermine this critical goal and prevent schools from providing an equal education to all students, regardless of faith. We will not allow Louisiana lawmakers to undermine these religious-freedom rights.", "source": {"uri": "bossierpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bossier Press-tribune          "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_United_for_Separation_of_Church_and_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Americans United for Separation of Church and State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_From_Religion_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom From Religion Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed House Bill 71 into law Wednesday after declaring recently that he \"could not wait to be sued.\"\n\nRights groups immediately condemned the law and vowed to challenge it. In a joint statement, the national and state ACLU as well as the Freedom from Religion Foundation and Americans United for Separation of Church and State called the law \"blatantly unconstitutional\" -- a violation of the separation of church and state.\n\nThe religious diversity of Louisiana schools must be respected, the groups said.\n\n\"Our public schools are not Sunday schools,\" the statement said, \"and students of all faiths, or no faith, should feel welcome in them.\"\n\nTo strengthen the law against legal challenges, Republicans framed the requirement as a way of teaching American history. The law's language declares the Ten Commandments to be one of the \"foundational documents of our state and national government\" -- a claim many critics dispute.\n\nThe commandments must be displayed with a \"context statement\" declaring that they \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\" The law offers schools the option to also display the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, or the Northwest Ordinance.\n\nLawmakers in Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah have recently proposed similar bills regarding the display of the commandments, The Associated Pressreported.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a similar law in Kentucky, citing the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which allows for no laws \"respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nLandry took office in January, replacing Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, who had for eight years stymied the agenda of Republican lawmakers. This year, they've brought forth a \"flurry of conservative legislation,\" according toThe New York Times.\n\nIt is not clear how the U.S. Supreme Court will treat the 1980 precedent. In recent years the court has consistently supported religious rights. In 2022, the six conservative justices ruled that a football coach in Washington who prayed with his players after games was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThe new law -- enacted Wednesday amid rising fears of Christian nationalism and its proponents crafting laws across the United States -- sparked anger and mockery on social media.\n\n\"Apparently Louisiana has enough surplus budget money to defend ridiculous laws?,\" X user Patti Ringo wrote on the platform.\n\n\"The regression of America continues,\" another X user, David Poland, wrote. \"How long will women and people of color be trusted with the vote?\"\n\nEven Christian groups have come out against the law. In late May, a group of more than 100 pastors and churchgoers sent Landry an open letter calling for him to veto the bill, arguing that it was not the place of the government to control religious education and that the law \"disrespects religious diversity.\"\n\nThe group also criticized the authors of the law, which mandates exact wording of the commandments, for choosing an official version of the Ten Commandments, when different faith traditions have different versions and interpretations.\n\n\"To me that is a clear case of the government saying this religion is more important than the others,\" Rev. Jon Parks, senior co-pastor at University Baptist Church in Baton Rouge and a signer of the open letter, toldThe Advocate, a Louisiana newspaper. \"There are places where the Ten Commandments belong

The new law, signed by Governor Jeff Landry, mandates that the Commandments be prominently displayed on posters at least 11 by 14 inches with a clear, readable font.\n\nGovernor Landry stated, \"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses.\" Proponents argue that the Ten Commandments provide valuable lessons and are a historical document that has significantly influenced American legal principles.\n\nHowever, the law has already drawn sharp criticism and promises of legal challenges from civil rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation have labeled the mandate \"blatantly unconstitutional.\" Alanah Odoms, executive director of ACLU Louisiana, remarked, \"Governor Landry's decision to require schools to display the Ten Commandments is a disappointing step backward.\"\n\nCritics argue that the law violates the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which prohibits government endorsement of religion. In a joint statement, opposing groups declared, \"Our public schools are not Sunday schools, and students of all faiths, or no faith, should feel welcome in them.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent rulings, particularly the 2022 decision in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, which sided with a high school coach's right to pray on the field, have emboldened supporters of the law. These rulings have signaled a shift towards a more lenient interpretation of the Establishment Clause.\n\nMatt Krause, a lawyer for the First Liberty Institute, asserted, \"The Ten Commandments is there, time and time again, as the basis and foundation for the system that America was built upon.\" Yet, scholars and civil rights advocates caution that the law represents an overreach that could undermine the separation of church and state.\n\nCharles C. Haynes, a senior fellow at the Freedom Forum, noted, \"Even this court will have a hard time justifying what lawmakers have conceived. The result could amount to a catastrophic erosion in the divisions between government and religion.\"", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_United_for_Separation_of_Church_and_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americans United for Separation of Church and State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_From_Religion_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom From Religion Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_v._Bremerton_School_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy v.

The story is in the Old Testament book of Exodus. The set of exhortations includes calls not to kill, steal, lie, or covet other people's possessions, as well as appeals to honor one's parents and to worship.\n\nBut the bill also stipulates that public funds should not be used to install the posters, saying the costs will instead be covered by donations.\n\nLandry also approved measures authorizing the hiring of chaplains in schools, restricting teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and preventing schools from using a transgender student's preferred pronoun without first obtaining parental consent.\n\nLandry said other changes would expand tutoring for underperforming students, help improve math skills, and give teachers more freedom in selecting topics to teach.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and two other groups -- Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation -- said they would challenge the bill.\n\n\"Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" their joint statement said.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nThe First Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits the government from the \"establishment of religion,\" and in 1980 the Supreme Court ruled that a Kentucky law on posting the Ten Commandments in schools was unconstitutional.\n\nIn that case, part of the court's rationale for striking down the measure was that displaying the text had no discernible secular purpose but a clear religious one.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe displays, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nThe posters would be paid for through donations. State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nDoes this comply with Religious Freedom in the First Amendment?\n\nThe left seems to be uncontent with simply killing babies, hating Christians and all of their other normal hobbies.\n\nThey've now taken it up a notch to actively disrespect the Bible.\n\nDoesn't seem like something you'd want to do, but that's just me!\n\nTo each their own I guess.\n\nI mean, these sure look like some good, definitely non-loser people....\n\nA group a multiple different faiths has gotten together to attack the #1 problem plaguing us all.\n\nHomeless people overrunning a once-beautiful California?\n\nNo.\n\nLook, we could be here a while, let me just tell you: CLIMATE CHANGE!\n\nAfter all, the icebergs and polar ice caps were supposed to be totally GONE by the year 2000, so you can only imagine how bad they must be now in 2022...\n\nWe were all supposed to be dead and the planet a supernova in 2005 basically from global warming, so it's a miracle I'm even here on the face of this great Earth typing this!\n\nAll sarcasm aside, this is a real story and this is how these people have chosen to spend their time.\n\nBut I don't blame them.\n\nThis is obviously orchestrated by people like the Mother WEFers, the United Nations and all their friends.\n\nMock God, get some attention, and push the money-laundering agenda that you have to pay them taxes for something totally made up and fake!\n\nA trifecta!\n\nI'm really ranting here, let me show you some details.\n\nSo not only did they create 10 Blasphemous Commandments, but they travelled to a Holy Site to deliver them.\n\nTHEN....they smashed them, just like Moses did.\n\nI bet you not one person in this whole group even knows the details behind WHY Moses smashed those 10 Commandments.\n\nAn Israeli climate activist smashed tablets representing the 10 climate change principles, mirroring Moses's smashing of the biblical commandments, in a demonstration against climate crisis inaction atop Jebel Musa, the mountain thought by many to be Sinai. The event, published in a YouTube video published last Sunday, took place in protest of the COP 27 climate conference taking place in Sharm el Sheikh.\n\nThe tablets, which read \"keep your promises\" in Hebrew, represented the 10 Spiritual Principles for Climate Repentance. The principles, which were developed by interfaith leaders at the Elijah Board of World Religious Leaders in the proceeding days, were read aloud before the tablets were smashed.\n\n\"Climate promises have not been kept worldwide, including in Israel.\"\n\nYosef Abramowitz and other activists said that they acted in response to a lack of action from the world's governments to reduce global emissions and fight climate change.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" Abramowitz lamented before smashing the first tablet, \"Climate promises have not been kept worldwide, including in Israel.\"\n\nAbramowitz said that \"when it comes to the leaders of the world who are gathering at COP 27: there's a lot of talk, there's some action, but there's not enough to be able to keep the world to one and a half degrees on the warming. The whole world needs to cut our emissions by half by 2030, and they're not yet. We take these Green Commandments, we look down to Sharm El-Sheikh, and we're not satisfied,\" Abramowitz declared before proceeding to smash the second tablet.\n\nIn addition to expressing disappointment for the governments of the world in general, Abramowitz had a message for the government of Israel.\n\n\"Gas is 3 times more expensive than solar power in Israel, so if you want to lower the cost of living and be part of the international climate consensus, up your goals from 30% to 50% renewables by 2030,\" he said.\n\nOriginally, the activists intended to bring dozens of multifaith leaders to the mountain for the ceremony, but Egyptian authorities prevented them from doing so.\n\nNevertheless, Abramowitz and other activists were able to conduct the ceremony. During the same week, other demonstrations took place on mountaintops. Additionally, the 10 climate principles were read in a live stream from Parliament Hill in Ottawa.\n\nCOP climate conference and protests\n\nSharm el Sheikh, the Egyptian host city of the COP 27 climate conference, located in the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, is roughly 100 miles from Jebel Musa.\n\nIt's not the first time climate activists have gone to protest the annual UN climate conference. Last year during the COP 26 conference in Glasgow, Scotland, teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg criticized the event.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, she said, \"Nothing has changed from previous years really. The leaders will say we'll do this... and then they will do nothing... We can have as many COPs as we want, but nothing real will come out of it.\"\n\nFrom a Biblical perspective, it does feel wrong to show no concern for the planet.\n\nAfter all, God created it and then he placed Adam in charge to be its steward.\n\nI don't ascribe to the theory that the planet is doomed and only WE can help it.\n\nSorry folks, the Bible actually says this entire place is going to be burned up and a new Heaven and Earth created.\n\nWe are not to worship this Earth.\n\nWe are not to assume that we can protect it forever.\n\nBecause you can't.\n\nIt will last for as long as God wants it to last, and then the Book of Revelation clearly tells us at some point it will be swallowed up and consumed and a new Heaven and new Earth will take it's place.\n\nAnd no amount of Climate Tax is going to stop that, I can assure you!\n\nSo my take is be good stewards of the land when we can.\n\nTake care of it by employing things like good farming techniques, etc.\n\nI stick with a Biblical view and I DEFINITELY do not worship the creation.\n\nWorshipping the Earth has a name, did you know that?\n\nThey call it \"Gaia\" and worshipping the Earth is \"Gaia Worship\".\n\nI bet you've seen that name before and if not you will in the future.\n\nAny time you see that, you should RUN in the other direction!\n\nNow back to our story....\n\nHere is the whole group conducting their blasphemous ritual.\n\nWatch if you can stomach it:\n\nInterestingly enough, this isn't the first time this has been tried.\n\nThe Pope announced his own Climate Change Commandments about 8 years ago:\n\nPope Francis released a sweeping statement about the environment on Thursday, calling for \"cultural revolution\" to change our lifestyles - from our addiction to technology to our treatment of the poor.\n\nThe document is very long - 184 pages in English. But here are 10 quick commandments the Pope says everybody can follow to stop the \"disturbing warming\" of our planet.\n\n1. Think of future generations.\n\nPope Encyclical 1\n\n2. Embrace alternative energy sources.\n\nPope Encyclical 2\n\n3. Consider pollution's effect on the poor.\n\nPope Encyclical 3\n\n4. Take the bus!\n\nPope Encyclical 4\n\n5. Be humble.\n\nPope Encyclical 5 b\n\n6. Don't become a slave to your phone.\n\nPope Encyclical 6\n\n7. Don't trade online relationships for real ones.\n\nPope Encyclical 7\n\n8. Turn off the lights, recycle and don't waste food.\n\nPope Encyclical 8 b\n\n9. Educate yourself.\n\nPope Encyclical 9 b\n\n10. Believe you can make a difference.\n\nPope Encyclical 10\n\nI don't know why, but it absolutely cracks me up that #4 is \"Take The Bus\".\n\nSave your emails, Catholics, I don't want to hear them.\n\nMeanwhile, here is yet ANOTHER reason I love President Trump:\n\nPresident Trump is taking \"woke\" head on.\n\nAnd peak woke is the climate hoax, which is really just another way to extort money from the American people.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The bill wasn't signed by Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, but his declining to sign or veto it within a certain time frame means it will become law, according to The Associated Press.\n\nOpponents have warned that the law will likely be challenged in court. The threat of legal action - and a 1980 Supreme Court decision that called the requirement unconstitutional - has deterred other states like Utah, Texas and Oklahoma from passing similar laws. This makes Louisiana the first state in the nation to enact the requirement.\n\nThe displays, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nThe posters won't be paid for with state funds, according to the bill's language. They'll be funded through donations instead.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nIt's not the only controversial law the conservative legislature passed in their session that ended earlier this month: A new Louisiana abortion law would make mifepristone and misoprostol, also known as the \"abortion pills,\" a controlled, dangerous substance - the first law of its kind in the nation.\n\nState lawmakers also approved a measure that would allow judges the option to sentence someone to surgical castration after the person has been convicted of certain aggravated sex crimes -- including rape, incest and molestation -- against a child younger than 13. The National Conference of State Legislatures said it is unaware of any other states that allow judges to impose surgical castration outright.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType":

Jeff Landry signed legislation on Wednesday requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in every public classroom in Louisiana, making the state the only one with such a mandate and reigniting the debate over how porous the boundary between church and state should be.\n\nCritics, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, vowed a legal fight against the law they deemed \"blatantly unconstitutional.\" But it is a battle that proponents are prepared, and in many ways, eager, to take on.\n\n\"I can't wait to be sued,\" Landry said Saturday at a Republican fundraiser in Nashville, Tennessee, according to The Tennessean. And on Wednesday, as he signed the measure, he argued that the Ten Commandments contained valuable lessons for students.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law,\" he said, \"you've got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.\"\n\nThe legislation is part of a broader campaign by conservative Christian groups to amplify public expressions of faith, and provoke lawsuits that could reach the Supreme Court, where they expect a friendlier reception than in years past.\n\n\"The climate is certainly better,\" said Charles C. Haynes, a senior fellow at the Freedom Forum and a scholar with an expertise in religious liberty and civil discourse, referring to the viewpoint of those who support the legislation.\n\nStill, Haynes said that he found the enthusiasm behind the Louisiana law and other efforts unwarranted. \"I think they are overreaching,\" he said, adding that \"even this court will have a hard time justifying\" what lawmakers have conceived.\n\nThe measure in Louisiana requires that the commandments be displayed in each classroom of every public elementary, middle and high school, as well as public college classrooms. The posters must be no smaller than 11 by 14 inches and the commandments must be \"the central focus of the poster\" and \"in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nCritics said the legislation was a clear constitutional violation. In a joint statement, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Southern Poverty Law Center argued that the law \"violates students' and families' fundamental right to religious freedom.\"\n\n\"Our public schools are not Sunday schools,\" the statement said, \"and students of all faiths, or no faith, should feel welcome in them.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_From_Religion_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom From Religion Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tennessean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Tennessean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_United_for_Separation_of_Church_and_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americans United for Separation of Church and State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunday school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ten_Commandments_Law_Louisiana_21476-66735a6eb2f27-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665769", "eventUri": "eng-9665769", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The commandments must be \"in a large, easily readable font\" and the poster no smaller than no smaller than 11 by 14 inches.\n\nThe law's text portrays the commandments as having a \"historical role\" and states that including the religious text \"in the education of our children is part of our state and national history, culture, and tradition.\" According the Associated Press, the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance is also authorized, but not required, by the new mandate.\n\nOrganizations opposing the mandate include the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation. In a joint statement, the groups vowed to file a lawsuit challenging the Louisiana law and said it violated \"the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nDuring a GOP fundraiser dinner in Nashville last week, Landry boasted about welcoming the legal fight. \"I'm going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms,\" he said during his keynote address. \"And I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nSince taking office as Louisiana governor, Landry -- a Republican backed by former President Donald Trump -- has sought to usher in a slew of conservative legislation. His predecessor, John Bel Edwards, who was the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, was unable to seek reelection due to consecutive term limits.\n\nIn March, bills helmed by the Republican governor were passed to lengthen time served for some prison sentences, to effectively eliminate parole for most jailed, to charge 17-year-olds as adults, and to allow methods for carrying out the death penalty beyond lethal injection. Then, in May, Landry signed a bill to reclassify drugs used in abortion as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess misoprostol and mifepristone without a prescription.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charisma_madarang@rollingstone.com", "name": "Charisma Madarang", "type":

(AP) -- Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom, the latest move from a GOP-dominated Legislature pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor.\n\nThe legislation that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\nOpponents questioned the law's constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nRifts seem to appear between Israel's political and military leadership over conduct of the Gaza war\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli army's chief spokesman on Wednesday appeared to question the stated goal of destroying the Hamas militant group in Gaza in a rare public rift between the country's political and military leadership.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will pursue the fight against Hamas, the group running the besieged Gaza Strip, until its military and governing capabilities in the Palestinian territory are eliminated. But with the war now in its ninth month, frustration has been mounting with no clear end or postwar plan in sight.\n\n\"This business of destroying Hamas, making Hamas disappear -- it's simply throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\" Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, told Israel's Channel 13 TV. \"Hamas is an idea, Hamas is a party. It's rooted in the hearts of the people -- whoever thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.\"\n\nNetanyahu's office responded by saying that the country's security Cabinet, chaired by the prime minister, \"has defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities as one of the goals of the war. The Israeli military, of course, is committed to this.\"\n\nThe military quickly issued a clarification, saying it was \"committed to achieving the goals of the war as defined by the Cabinet\" and that it has been working on this \"throughout the war, day and night, and will continue to do so.\"\n\nScorching temperatures, humidity making life miserable for millions from Midwest to Maine\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- A blistering heat wave Wednesday extended from the Midwest to New England, leaving millions of people sweltering through the Juneteenth holiday, including in places like northern Maine where they rarely experience such conditions this early in the year.\n\nThe city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees (39.4 C) on the heat index, which combines heat and humidity. The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees (34.4 C) compared with 89 (31.6 C), according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nWhat's known, and not known, about the partnership agreement signed by Russia and North Korea\n\nBoth Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un say the strategic partnership they signed Wednesday is a breakthrough. But neither side has released the text of the agreement that resulted from their summit in Pyongyang, and its consequences for the near and long terms are uncertain.\n\nRelations between sprawling Russia and small, isolated North Korea -- both of them nuclear powers -- have warmed significantly in recent years amid Russia's growing acrimony with the West over the invasion of Ukraine and suppression of all domestic opposition.\n\nThe new agreement could bring them even closer, while also posing new challenges to the international community.\n\nWhat's in the new partnership, according to Kim and Putin:\n\nPutin told a briefing after the signing that \"the comprehensive partnership agreement provides, among other things, for the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this document.\"\n\nCooler temps and rain could help corral blazes that forced thousands to flee New Mexico village\n\nROSWELL, N.M. (AP) -- Air tankers dropped water and red retardant on Wednesday on a pair of growing fires in mountainous New Mexico that killed at least one person, damaged more than 1,400 structures, forced thousands to flee a tourist locale and may now threaten hundreds of firefighters amid high wind risks.\n\nStrong wind on Monday pushed the larger of two wildfires into the mountain village of Ruidoso, forcing residents to flee with little notice. Weather patterns were shifting Wednesday with moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, Bladen Breitreiter of the National Weather Service office in Albuquerque said Wednesday.\n\n\"It will be a challenging situation going into the late afternoon and evening,\" said Breitreiter, who has been an incident meteorologist at past wildfires. \"The potential for scattered to isolated thunderstorms could help, but it depends on where they hit. If the rain misses the fires, downward winds could cause problems for firefighters on the ground.\"\n\nHe said rain could also lead to dangerous flash flooding in newly burned areas. Light rain started to fall on some areas outside Ruidoso by early afternoon.\n\nThe two fires remained at 0% containment Wednesday afternoon as crews used heavy equipment to build fire lines while water and retardant was dropped from the air, authorities said.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto forms in southwest Gulf, 1st named storm of the hurricane season\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tropical Storm Alberto formed on Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of what is forecast to be a busy hurricane season.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico on Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Wednesday afternoon that Alberto was located about 170 miles (270 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 305 miles (495 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph). The storm is moving west-southwest at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by early Thursday morning.\n\nColombian family's genes offer new clue to delaying onset of Alzheimer's\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists studying a family plagued by early-in-life Alzheimer's found some carry a genetic oddity that delays their initial symptoms by five years.\n\nThe finding points to novel ways of fighting the mind-robbing disease - if researchers can unravel how a single copy of that very rare gene variant offers at least a little protection.\n\n\"It opens new avenues,\" said neuropsychologist Yakeel Quiroz of Massachusetts General Hospital, who helped lead the study published Wednesday. \"There are definitely opportunities to copy or mimic the effects.\"\n\nThe first hint of this genetic protection came a few years ago. Researchers were studying a huge family in Colombia that shares a devastating inherited form of Alzheimer's when they discovered one woman who escaped her genetic fate. Aliria Piedrahita de Villegas should have developed Alzheimer's symptoms in her 40s but instead made it to her 70s before suffering even mild cognitive trouble.\n\nThe big clue: She also harbored something incredibly rare, two copies of an unrelated gene named APOE3 that had a mutation dubbed Christchurch. That odd gene pair appeared to shield her, staving off her genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's.\n\nImmigrant families rejoice over Biden's expansive move toward citizenship, while some are left out\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of immigrants had reason to rejoice when President Joe Biden unveiled a highly expansive plan to extend legal status to spouses of U.S. citizens but, inevitably, some were left out.\n\nClaudia Z\u00faniga, 35, married in 2017, or 10 years after her husband came to the United States. He moved to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, after they wed, knowing that, by law, he had to live outside the country for years to gain legal status. \"Our lives took a 180-degree turn,\" she said.\n\nBiden announced Tuesday that his administration will, in coming months, allow U.S. citizens' spouses without legal status to apply for permanent residency and eventually citizenship without having to first depart the country for up to 10 years. About 500,000 immigrants may benefit, according to senior administration officials.\n\nTo qualify, an immigrant must have lived in the United States for 10 years and be married to a U.S. citizen, both as of Monday. Z\u00faniga's husband is ineligible because he wasn't in the United States.\n\n\"Imagine, it would be a dream come true,\" said Z\u00faniga, who works part time in her father's transportation business in Houston. \"My husband could be with us. We could focus on the well-being of our children.\"\n\nA US aircraft carrier and its crew have fought Houthi attacks for months. How long can it last?\n\nABOARD THE USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER IN THE RED SEA (AP) -- The combat markings emblazoned on the F/A-18 fighter jet tell the story: 15 missiles and six drones, painted in black just below the cockpit windshield.\n\nAs the jet sits on the deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, its markings illuminate the enemy targets that it's destroyed in recent months and underscore the intensity of the fight to protect commercial shipping from persistent missile and drone attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nBut they also hint at the fatigue setting in, as the carrier, its strike group and about 7,000 sailors close in on their ninth month waging the most intense running sea battle since World War II. That raises difficult questions about what comes next as U.S. military and defense leaders wrangle over how they will replicate the carrier's combat power if the ship returns home to Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nAlready, the carrier's deployment has been extended twice, and sailors post dark memes around the ship about only getting one short break during their steadily growing tour. Some worry they could be ordered to stay out even longer as the campaign drags on to protect global trade in the vital Red Sea corridor.\n\nAt the Pentagon, leaders are wrestling with what has become a thorny but familiar debate. Do they bow to Navy pressure to bring the Eisenhower and the other three warships in its strike group home or heed U.S. Central Command's plea to keep them there longer? And if they bring them home -- what can replace them?\n\nOn Juneteenth, monument dedicated in Alabama to those who endured slavery\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Thousands of surnames grace the towering monument, representing the more than 4 million enslaved people who were freed after the Civil War.\n\nThe Equal Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform nonprofit, invoked the Juneteenth holiday -- the day that commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. -- on Wednesday as it dedicated its National Monument to Freedom.\n\nThe monument, which honors the people who endured and survived slavery, is the centerpiece of the new Freedom Monument Sculpture Park in Montgomery, Alabama, where art and historical artifacts tell the story of enslaved people in the United States.\n\nDuring the dedication ceremony, Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recounted how enslaved people endured unspeakable horrors, but also left a legacy of perseverance and strength.\n\n\"Enslaved people in this country did something remarkable that we need to acknowledge, that we need to recognize and that we need to celebrate. Enslaved people resisted. Enslaved people were resilient. Enslaved people found ways to make a way,\" Stevenson said.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

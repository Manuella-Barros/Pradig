To celebrate the achievement, Best appeared on the Today show on August 5, where he got down on one knee and popped the question to his girlfriend of nine years.\n\nWhile speaking with Today co-anchors Hoda Kotb, Savannah Guthrie, Al Roker and Craig Melvin, Best and Duncan stood in front of the Eiffel Tower as they opened up about their relationship. At one point, members of Best's family appeared on camera with more than 2,700 yellow roses, which came as a total surprise to Duncan.\n\n\"Lainey Olivia Duncan, you are the love of my life,\" Best said, as he got down on one knee. \"You have been with me since day one.\"\n\n\"I knew you were special - it was the first date. I said to you, 'I wanted to go to the Olympics,' and you, without question, said, 'Yeah, absolutely. Go for it,'\" he recalled. \"You are stunningly beautiful. Ferociously intelligent. Your kindness is bent leaps and bounds. I don't know anyone that doesn't love you.\"\n\nBest continued: \"This is going to be the easiest question of my life. I want to spend the rest of my life with you and raise a family together. Lainey, will you marry me?\"\n\nAs Duncan accepted Best's proposal without hesitation, their family and fellow Team USA athletes immediately cheered behind them. The 26-year-old rower then took a moment to explain the significance behind the thousands of yellow roses.\n\n\"Each yellow rose represents a day that you and I have been together,\" Best said. \"Obviously we communicated through Snapchat. Our streak is 2,738 right now. So there are 2,738 yellow roses from Snapchat. Our love is truly now immortalized.\"\n\nDuncan replied: \"I am so, so happy. This is the best day of my life.\"\n\nThe couple celebrated their ninth anniversary in March this year. According to Best's Team USA profile, he got his start in rowing after his parents watched the 2010 film, The Social Network. The Pennsylvania native attended Drexel University, graduating in 2019 with a degree in business and engineering. Meanwhile, Duncan also attended Drexel University and graduated with a degree in fashion and apparel design, according to her LinkedIn.\n\nOn Thursday, Best - along with his teammates Nick Mead, Michael Grady, and Liam Corrigan - achieved the gold medal in rowing's 2,000-meter men's four final. The team came in first place with a final time of five minutes and 49 seconds, just beating runner-ups New Zealand by 0.85 of a second, while Great Britain won the bronze medal.

And she got the diamond.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Best made history alongside teammates Nick Mead, Michael Grady and Liam Corrigan by winning Team USA's first gold in the men's four rowing competition in 64 years. Following the event, Best revealed that he used Jason Kelce's 2018 Super Bowl LVII parade speech to pump himself up.\n\n\"We watched it the other day,\" he said in an interview clip shared via X. \"I had my girlfriend on my shoulder when he was giving that speech, and I'm just like, 'I'm excited.'

Best got down on one knee and popped the question with family members holding baskets of 2,738 yellow roses surrounding the couple, with each rose representing a day the pair had been together.\n\n\"I knew you were special -- it was the first date. I said to you, 'I wanted to go to the Olympics,' and you, without question, said 'Yeah, absolutely. Go for it,'\" he said, with the Eiffel Tower in the background. \"You are stunningly beautiful. ferociously intelligent. Your kindness is bent leaps and bounds -- I don't know anyone that doesn't love you.\"\n\nDuncan, wearing a long white dress, appeared stunned and emotional as she accepted the proposal.\n\n\"I got the gold and the girl. And she got the diamond!\" Best said.\n\nThe happy couple was joined by Best's teammates, Nick Mead, Michael Grady, and Liam Corrigan. The new Olympic medalists recently won gold for Team USA, the first gold medal in the men's four rowing competition in 64 years.\n\nJust the day before, shot putter Payton Otterdahl, 28, revealed on social media that he had popped the question in front of the Eiffel Tower. Otterdahl, a former North Dakota State NCAA champion thrower, declared his love for his fianc\u00e9 while on bended knee in Paris on Sunday.\n\n\"Meanwhile, in the City of Love... I love you forever, Maddy Nilles!\" he posted on Instagram, along with a series of photos with his new fianc\u00e9.\n\nAlthough the shot putter came in fourth place in Saturday's final, he scored his personal best with a throw of 22.03 meters. Team USA also still scored two medals in the competition. This was Otterdahl's second Olympic Games after he competed in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower, an iconic landmark associated with romance, is ranked fourth in the list of most popular places in the world to pop the question, according UK-based wedding site Hitched.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Best", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Best"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rowing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mead_(rower)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Mead (rower)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Corrigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Corrigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Grady", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Grady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_women's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Otterdahl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Otterdahl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_put", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shot put"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/id1009149-Justin-Best.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792050", "eventUri": "eng-9792050", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

He had also secured a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last week\n\nUS athlete Justin Best secured a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last week -- the country's first rowing gold medal in the men's four class since 1960. But the 'best day of his life' came later on Monday as he proposed to his girlfriend in front of the Eiffel Tower. The event was broadcast on live TV and showed the rower getting down on one knee amidst thousands of yellow roses as well-wishers cheered.\n\n\"Each yellow rose represents a day that you and I have been together. Our streak on Snapchat is 2,738 days right now. So there are 2,738 yellow roses from Snapchat. Our love is truly now immortalised. I am so, so happy. This is the best day of my life,\" Best told USA Today.\n\nThe development comes mere days after Chinese badminton player Liu Yuchen proposed to badminton mixed doubles gold medalist Huang Yaqiong minutes after her win. Meanwhile her partner and fellow gold medallist Zheng Siwei said he got engaged three years ago after losing in the final and considered this a better experience.\n\n\"For me, the proposal is very surprising because I have been preparing for the game. Today I am an Olympic champion and I got proposed (to), so that's something I didn't expect,\" AP quoted Huang as saying through an interpreter.\n\nLiam Corrigan, Justin Best, Michael Grady and Nick Mead won the elusive gold last week on Thursday by beating out New Zealand and defending world champion Britain. The same group had previously left the Tokyo Games three years ago without any medals before proceeding to win silver at the world championships last year and gold at the world cup race in Lucerne earlier this year.\n\nThe US men's four had last stood on the Olympic podium during the London Games in 2012 to receive a bronze medal.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Best", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Best"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rowing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Yuchen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liu Yuchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_Yaqiong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Huang Yaqiong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mead_(rower)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Mead (rower)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Corrigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Corrigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Grady", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Grady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Siwei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zheng Siwei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rowing_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Rowing Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucerne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucerne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucerne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/06/600x338/Justin_Best_proposal_1722949259472_1722950034919.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792050", "eventUri": "eng-9792050", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

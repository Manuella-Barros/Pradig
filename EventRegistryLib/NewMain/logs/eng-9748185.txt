His defense switched his plea after months of speculation that his attorneys would use an insanity defense at trial.\n\nAs part of the plea agreement, federal prosecutors have proposed a sentence between 180 to 217 months -- or 15 to 18 years. Sentencing will take place Oct. 21.\n\nBrown potentially faced between 10 years and life in prison on the charges of interference with federally protected activities along with use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, with no option for parole.\n\nAt the plea change hearing, Brown's defense team told U.S. District Court Judge Benjamin Beaton they have also worked on a proposed plea agreement with state prosecutors for a concurrent sentence of 10 years for his state court charges.\n\nHere's what to know about the high-profile 2022 shooting:\n\nThe 2022 shooting at Craig Greenberg's campaign office\n\nBrown was arrested Feb. 14, 2022, shortly after police say he used a 9mm Glock to fire shots into Greenberg's campaign office in the Butchertown Market on Story Avenue. None of the five people inside were injured, but one shot tore through Greenberg's sweater.\n\nA photo of the torn sweater later was used in a campaign ad where Greenberg, who would win the Democratic primary months later and take office in 2023, promoted his public safety plan. To prosecutors, the image illustrated just how close the then-candidate had come to catastrophe.\n\nGreenberg said the sweater was torn after one bullet came \"so close that it grazed my sweater and shirt\" at a press conference in the aftermath of the shooting. But in a past motion, Brown's defense team called for testimony \"suggesting attribution of the hole in (Greenberg's) sweater to a bullet\" to be barred from a potential trial, as his lawyers argued no evidence supported that theory.\n\nWhy was Brown charged at the federal level?\n\nBrown's initial arrest drew national attention when he was released on bail and put on home incarceration two nights after the shooting. The Louisville Community Bail Fund, a charitable bail fund, paid the required 10% of Brown's $100,000 bond to secure his release.\n\nThe release drew criticism from Greenberg, along with officials including Metro Councilman Anthony Piagentini and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who on the floor of the Senate, described the move as \"the radical left (bailing) their comrade out of jail.\"\n\nDefense attorney Rob Eggert pushed back later that day, arguing his client's arrest came \"at the prompting of Sen. Mitch McConnell\" and accusing the U.S. Attorney's Office of failing to take such action following the 2020 killing of Breonna Taylor by LMPD, which sparked protests that lasted through the year and eventually led to a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.\n\nBrown was indicted in federal court, with the government successfully moving for him to be detained pending trial.\n\nWhat about Quintez Brown's state trial?\n\nBrown has also been charged in Jefferson Circuit Court with one count of attempted murder and four counts of first-degree wanton endangerment in connection with the shooting. He initially pleaded not guilty.\n\nHowever, Brown's defense attorneys say they have worked out a proposed plea agreement with state prosecutors that would see Brown serving a concurrent sentence of 10 years.\n\nThat case's next pretrial hearing is currently set for Oct. 16.\n\nWhat were the concerns about Brown's mental evaluation?\n\nPrior to Brown's change in plea, his defense and federal prosecutors battled over whether mental health evaluations conducted on Brown with a psychiatrist retained by the defense should be admissible as evidence.\n\nThe two interviews, which are sealed, took place in November 2022 and November 2023 with psychiatrist Bhushan Agharkar. Brown's attorneys said his testimony in the two sessions supports an \"insanity\" and \"diminished capacity\" defense, which argues the defendant's mental state did not allow them to make effective decisions.\n\nBut in a pair of relatively lengthy motions, prosecutors believe the interviews, in which Brown described his alleged intent to the psychiatrist, would enable the defendant to \"tell his own story without having to testify\" and be subject to cross-examination, and could \"serve as a conduit for inadmissible hearsay.\"\n\nIn the interviews, the filings say, Brown gave his account of the shooting and the events that led up to it. Prosecutors say Brown told the psychiatrist he had gone to Greenberg's office \"with another intent,\" but \"impulsively and without aiming\" fired a gun into the office. Agharkar diagnosed him with \"Bipolar Disorder, Type I, with Psychotic features,\" and \"Marijuana Use Disorder, in remission in a controlled environment\" and said Brown was driven by a belief that the incident would \"make the world 'pay attention.'\"\n\nReach Lucas Aulbach at laulbach@courier-journal.com.

He previously plead not guilty to the charges, but was in court Friday for a change of plea hearing.\n\nBrown's guilty plea is conditional on the judge's sentencing approval. He could face between 15 to 18 years in prison.\n\nAuthorities said Brown walked into Greenberg's campaign office on Feb. 14, 2022 and fired several rounds at the Democrat and his campaign staff. No one was injured in the shooting, however a bullet grazed Greenberg's sweater.\n\nEarlier this week, Greenberg said the attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump brought back the painful memories and the impact it had on his life.\n\n\"My heart dropped,\" the mayor said Monday. \"The memories and feelings of surviving an assassination attempt during a political campaign are still very fresh for me. A life-changing event like this can make us better or it can make us bitter.\"\n\nCourt documents allege Brown was \"building to the attempted murder\" 35 days prior to the shooting when he published an article on a blogging platform titled: \"A Revolutionary Love Letter.\" In the article, Brown allegedly wrote \"voting and petitioning will not be sufficient for our liberation.\"\n\nDays later, he then purchased a handgun and went to a shooting range to practice handling the firearm.\n\nFour days prior to the shooting, authorities said Brown began researching Greenberg and looked for the campaign office's address. The day before the shooting, Brown allegedly went to Greenberg's home.\n\nBrown's defense was planning to use an insanity defense, with an expert previously finding Brown \"was suffering from a mental disease or defect such that he was not able to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\"\n\nWhile Brown was in federal custody in 2023, prosecutors had him sent to a federal facility in Seattle for three months where he was subject to \"intense\" mental health evaluations, according to attorneys.\n\nIn May, a federal judge denied the prosecution's motion for an additional mental health evaluation of Brown saying their expert found no evidence of diminished mental capacity while he was in Seattle.\n\nA judge will make a final sentencing decision on October 21.", "source": {"uri": "whas11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "whas11.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Greenberg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Greenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Love", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolutionary Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insanity defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.whas11.com/assets/WHAS/images/f30cd46f-3d68-4e66-836d-5c9e2b255cdf/f30cd46f-3d68-4e66-836d-5c9e2b255cdf_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748185", "eventUri": "eng-9748185", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-21", "textStart": 2398, "textEnd": 2408}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-02-", "textStart": 543, "textEnd": 550}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

With new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe in attendance, the Dutchman managed to secure his second domestic title in two seasons at Old Trafford yesterday afternoon with a dramatic 2-1 win over rivals Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo capped off what has been a tough season for United in the best way possible, with their eighth-place Premier League finish, and therefore lack of European football, having essentially been chalked off by their trophy lift yesterday which secured them a spot in the Europa League for next season.

Other long-term issues include Mason Mount, who has found himself stuck on the sidelines numerous times with different problems this season, as well as Casemiro (who had never previously had an muscular injury in his career before his recurring hamstring issue at Man United) on top of Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire who both missed the FA Cup final over the weekend. However, amid reports suggesting players were worried about Ten Hag's training sessions and the amount of strain players were having to go under in them, Premier Injuries founder Be Dinnery believes that changes in backroom staff can often lead to players suffering season-upon-season. \"There are multiple influences and factors on what, how, where and when,\" he told football.london, on behalf of Crypto Casino. \"One of the most obvious considerations is stability within the club. Chelsea have always been a club with an excellent injury record going back to Guus Hiddink and Jose Mourinho, they were always there or there about having one of the best injury records. \"What the research will show is that changes within the backroom staff will have a serious impact on that injury burden. We started to see a rise in the number of incidents from Thomas Tuchel and then on to Graham Potter. In the space of five-to-six months, the incident levels almost doubled. Then under Frank Lampard, they continued to rise. \"The research will say that if you bring a head coach, it may have some impact because of new training regimes and tactics, but when you\u2019re bringing in additional members of staff then you\u2019ll see a distinct impact. One research paper indicates when we look at hamstring injuries, that burden can almost triple in terms of the changing of head coach and backroom staff. \"I think having that stability moving forward will lower that injury burden. You obviously have players coming into a league for the first time and they\u2019re young. What the data will tell us is it\u2019s incomparable in terms to the demands of the game and the intensity.\" Continuing to use Chelsea as an example, Dinnery highlighted two of the Blues stars that have suffered consistently with injuries and how managerial changes at the club and in their medical department under new owner Todd Boehly have negatively affected their fitness. \"A lot of people will talk about distance covered, that hasn\u2019t really changed a great deal, but what has changed is the intensity of the game and the time to recover from those distances,\" he continued. \"You\u2019re having a lot of players who are adapting. You\u2019re almost creating that perfect storm in terms of having an environment that isn\u2019t ideal and having a squad, regardless of how big it is. \"Managers are forced to take risks and make decisions. Factor all of that, the two biggest red flags are fatigue and previous injuries - one of the best indicators for future history. If you\u2019re talking about a squad carrying lots of injuries, that\u2019s going to stretch any squad and players will then be required to play through in certain situations when they\u2019d normally be taken out the firing line. \"A prime example (previous injuries) is Ben Chilwell. We\u2019re talking about a player who\u2019s coming on the back of a fairly significant knee problem and that keeps on happening. Reece James, another example. I did a study at the beginning of the season, James was a one in two player in the PL in terms of his availability. That figure has dropped even further - that was based on the last four seasons. \"To go into a campaign and expect James to play 60%-90% of PL games would have been hard because he hasn\u2019t been anywhere near those levels in the past four years. With no European football, there should have been an opportunity for Pochettino to bed great ideas, build his team and cohesion to move forward with an eye on 2024/25 but because of those problems, he hasn\u2019t been able to do so.\"", "summary": "The Red Devils owner has been told that a change in backroom staff could make things even worse for the medical department at Old Trafford", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-sir-jim-ratcliffe-29242824", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29243061.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154619775.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:00:00", "author": "Josh Holland,Oliver Jones", "authors": ["Josh Holland", "Oliver Jones"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.003}

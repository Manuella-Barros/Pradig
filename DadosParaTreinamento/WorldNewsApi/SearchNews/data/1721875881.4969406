The Oscar-nominated actor revealed on a recent episode of the Where Everybody Knows Your Name podcast that he hasn\u2019t regularly carried a cell phone with him in years because he found himself addicted to the device at one point. \u201cLet me explain something about Woody: He doesn\u2019t have a phone,\u201d his podcast co-host and Cheers co-star Ted Danson said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those bullies in life that make other people carry his phone for him. \u2018Hey, we need to know something immediately, call Woody.\u2019 And I just kinda laugh at whoever says that to me.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s not exactly true,\u201d Harrelson responded. \u201cI just don\u2019t like to have to be readily available to any human being at any time. And plus, that\u2019s not the reason. I like to be in touch with people, in a way, but I don\u2019t like the appendage on my appendage.\u201d The True Detective actor explained that he gave up using a cell phone three and a half years ago because he was spending too much time on it. \u201cI made a thing where I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m gonna set a two-hour limit on my phone,'\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like 9:30. I\u2019ve already hit my limit at 9:30. So I woke up and I\u2019ve been on it two hours already, because you know how it can just keep going and going.\u201d Harrelson said he even caught himself getting distracted by the phone when he was at dinner with someone and there was a \u201clull in the conversation.\u201d He also noted that he wasn\u2019t typically using apps or taking calls, but rather answering a lot of text messages. \u201cI never used it as a phone, ever,\u201d the White House Plumbers recalled. \u201cTexting.\u201d While Harrelson now lives a life undistracted by technology, Danson admitted, \u201cI admire what you do with phones, by the way, Woody. I need to emulate that.\u201d", "summary": "Woody Harrelson likely won&#8217;t be responding to any texts or calls in a timely fashion.

Terrorism designations expose and isolate organizations and individuals, and deny them access to the U.S. financial system.

REUTERS Pakistan: US move to blacklist Hizbul Mujahideen 'unjustified'US terror tag on Hizbul Mujahideen unlikely to affect militancy in ValleyHizbul Mujahideen ban goes global, but will it reach the Valley?\n\nIndia on Thursday welcomed the US decision to designate Kashmiri militant outfit Hizbul Mujahideen as a \"foreign terrorist organisation\", saying the move was \"long overdue\". The US on Wednesday designated the Hizbul Mujahideen as a foreign terrorist group, nearly two months after declaring its Pakistan-based chief Syed Salahuddin as a global terrorist. The decision to designate Hizbul Mujahideen as a foreign terrorist organisation was long overdue, a Home Ministry spokesperson said, adding \"it is well deserved\".\n\nThe decision, which slaps a series of US sanctions on the outfit, came against the backdrop of an upsurge in the activities of the militant group in Kashmir in recent months. Among other consequences, all of Hizbul Mujahideen's property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.\n\nThe US decision marks a severe blow to Pakistan which has been projecting the militant group as a voice of Kashmiri people. Formed in 1989, Hizbul Mujahideen is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir. It has claimed responsibility for several attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe State Department said terrorism designations expose and isolate organizations and individuals, and deny them access to the US financial system.

The move comes as a big blow to the terrorist outfit operating out of Kashmir and helmed by Pakistan-based Syed Salahuddin, who was also designated as a global terrorist recently by the US.\n\nA notification by the US Department of State says Hizbul Mujahideen, formed in 1989, is one of the \"largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir. \"Hizbul Mujahideen is led by Specially Designated Global Terrorist Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also known as Syed Salahuddin. Hizbul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including the April 2014, explosives attack in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which injured 17 people,\" it said.\n\nWhat is Hizbul Mujahideen\n\nAccording to South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), Hizbul Mujahideen is one of the largest terrorist organisations currently operating in Kashmir. It has a cadre base drawn from local and foreign sources. It is one of the 32 organisations banned under India's Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002.\n\nHizbul Mujahideen was founded in September 1989 with Master Ahsan Dar as its head. Dar was arrested in mid-December 1993. Reports say Hizbul Mujahideen was formed as the militant wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist organisation, at the behest of Pakistan's ISI to counter Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, which advocated total independence of Jammu and Kashmir. This was against Pakistan's open wish to take control of the state.\n\nSATP says many of the initial Hizbul cadres were JKLF members. Mohammed Yusuf Shah, who is popoularly known as Syed Salahuddin, approved the 'Constitution' of Hizbul in 1990. Reportedly, differences between Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and non JeI factions of Hizbul led to its divisions into groups led by Salahuddin and one Hilal Ahmed Mir, who was killed in 1993.\n\nHizbul Mujahideen is fighting for the integration of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan. It has also worked for Islamisation of Kashmir since its inception, says SATP.\n\nAt present, Hizbul Mujahideen has its headquarters at Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir Valley.\n\nWhile Hizbul Mujahideen is liked to JeI both in Kashmir and in Pakistan, it is also believed to be supported by Ghulam Nabi Fai's Kashmir American Council and Ayub Thakur's World Kashmir Freedom Movement in the US. It is also closely linked to ISIS, United Jehad Council and other terror groups operating from Pakistan.\n\nWhat the US designations for Hizbul Mujahideen means\n\nThe US Department of State notification seeks to deny the resources needed by the terrorist outfit to carry out attacks. All of Hizbul Mujahideeen property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are now blocked, and citizens of the country are also prohibited from having any transactions with the group.\n\n\"Today's action notifies the U.S. public and the international community that HM (Hijbul Mujahideen) is a terrorist organization. Terrorism designations expose and isolate organizations and individuals, and deny them access to the U.S. financial system. Moreover, designations can assist the law enforcement activities of U.S. agencies and other governments,\" the notification said.\n\nWhat is Executive Order 13224?\n\nAccording to the US state department, then President George Bush had signed Executive Order 13224 on September 23, 2001, giving the US government a powerful tool to impede terrorist funding. It was considered a part of the US' national commitment to lead the international effort to bring a halt to the evil of terrorist activity.\n\nThe order provides a means to disrupt the financial support network for terrorists and terrorist organizations by authorizing the US government to designate and block the assets of foreign individuals and entities that commit, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism.\n\nIt says, \"The order authorizes the US government to block the assets of individuals and entities that provide support, services, or assistance to, or otherwise associate with, terrorists and terrorist organizations designated under the Order, as well as their subsidiaries, front organizations, agents, and associates.\"", "id": "9620683", "details":

AP/PTI What is the Hizbul Mujahideen?Hizbul Mujahideen: US designates Syed Salahuddin's outfit as a foreign terrorist organisationUS designates Hizbul Mujahideen a foreign terrorist organisation, freezes assets\n\nThe Hizbul Mujahideen was designated as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) by the US State Department on Wednesday. The development comes nearly a month after the terrorist outfit's chief Syed Salahuddin was labeled a specially designated global terrorist. Established in 1989, the Hizbul Mujahideen is one of the oldest and the largest militant groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir. According to a statement from the US Department of State released on Wednesday evening: \"The designations seek to deny HM the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks.

Through United Nation Security Council, New Delhi has been pushing for a ban on Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) and its chief Syed Salahuddin, but has been vetoed by China.\n\n5.

While designating Hizbul Mujahideen as a foreign terrorist organisation, the US State Department statement further read: \"Today's action notifies the U.S. public and the international community that HM is a terrorist organization.

Trump, during his talk, also pledged that the US would continue to be a reliable, long-term supplier of energy.\n\nThe terror tag on the outfit would come as a blow to Pakistan, whose top leaders have openly described Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, who was killed in a gunfight last year, as a martyr.\n\nThe US State Department statement said: \"The Department of State has designated Hizbul Mujahideen -- also known as Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, also known as HM -- as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under section 1(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 13224. These designations seek to deny HM the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks. Among other consequences, all of HM's property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.\n\n\"Formed in 1989, HM is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir. Hizbul Mujahideen is led by Specially Designated Global Terrorist Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also known as Syed Salahuddin. Hizbul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including the April 2014, explosives attack in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which injured 17 people.\n\n\"Today's action notifies the US public and the international community that HM is a terrorist organisation. Terrorism designations expose and isolate organisations and individuals, and deny them access to the US financial system.

During the talk, both sides also decided to set up a new 2-by-2 ministerial dialogue to elevate their strategic consultations.\n\nTrump and Modi also said they look forward to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India this November, in which the US President's daughter Ivanka Trump is to lead the US delegation.\n\nThe US State Department move also comes as the first ever shipment of American crude oil to India is taking place from Texas this month. Trump, during his talk, also pledged that the US would continue to be a reliable, long-term supplier of energy.\n\nThe terror tag on the outfit would come as a blow to Pakistan, whose top leaders have openly described Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, who was killed in a gunfight last year, as a martyr.\n\nThe US State Department statement said: \"The Department of State has designated Hizbul Mujahideen -- also known as Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, also known as HM -- as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under section 1(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 13224. These designations seek to deny HM the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks. Among other consequences, all of HM's property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.\n\n\"Formed in 1989, HM is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir. Hizbul Mujahideen is led by Specially Designated Global Terrorist Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also known as Syed Salahuddin. Hizbul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including the April 2014, explosives attack in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which injured 17 people.\n\n\"Today's action notifies the US public and the international community that HM is a terrorist organisation. Terrorism designations expose and isolate organisations and individuals, and deny them access to the US financial system. Moreover, designations can assist the law enforcement activities of US agencies and other governments.\"\n\n--IANS\n\nrn/dg\n\nSEARCH", "id": "9532216", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "After Modi-Trump talk, US designates Hizbul as terror outfit", "image": "http://static.sify.com/cms/commons/widget/images/featured-thumbs-default-img.gif", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 12, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 18}, {"textStart": 2368, "date": "2014-04-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2378}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "54026", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir", "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "199444", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}, "id": "303326", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}, "id": "305325", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}, "id": "305421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Indo-Asian News Service"}, "id": "305741", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Asian_News_Service"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}, "id": "306470", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hizbul Mujahideen"}, "id": "307779", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hizbul_Mujahideen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "id": "307780", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir"}, {"label": {"eng": "International community"}, "id": "308438", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community"}, {"label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}, "id": "308732", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Explosive material"}, "id": "308978", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations"}, "id": "314554", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_State_Department_list_of_Foreign_Terrorist_Organizations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}, "id": "317779", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Executive order"}, "id": "324806", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sayeed Salahudeen"}, "id": "335573", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeed_Salahudeen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965"}, "id": "416048", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965"}, {"label": {"eng": "Specially Designated Global Terrorist"}, "id": "811724", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specially_Designated_Global_Terrorist"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}], "time": "17:26:00"}

of independence from the British Empire -- and the start of bitter rivalry and decades of conflict over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.\n\nSince 1989, rebel groups have fought in Indian-held Kashmir, demanding independence or a merger of the territory with Pakistan, and tens of thousands -- mostly civilians -- have been killed.\n\nIndia regularly accuses Pakistan of arming militants,

(Reuters Photo, File) Hizbul Mujahideen: US designates Syed Salahuddin's outfit as a foreign terrorist organisationUS designates Hizbul Mujahideen a foreign terrorist organisation, freezes assetsHizbul Mujahideen appoints Mohammad Bin Qasim as new chief after Yasin Yatoo's death\n\nThe Hizbul Mujahideen was designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US State Department on Wednesday, a month after its chief Syed Salahuddin was labelled a specially designated global terrorist. In a statement, the agency said the designations will help deny the Kashmir-based militant group the resources it needs to carry out attacks. The Hizb joins a list of Foreign Terrorist Organisations including the LTTE, al Qaeda, Jaish-e-Mohammed and the LeT.\n\nWhat is the Hizbul Mujahideen?\n\nThe Hizbul Mujahideen, also known as the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen or just HM, was formed in 1989. It is one of the largest and oldest militant groups in Jammu and Kashmir. The group is headed by Mohammad Yusuf Shah, who goes by the alias Syed Salahuddin.\n\nThe militant group has claimed responsibility for many attacks on Indian soil, including one in April 2014 which injured 17 people. In its order, the US State Department stated: \"These designations seek to deny HM the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks. Among other consequences, all of HM's property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.\" Read: US designates Hizbul Mujahideen a foreign terrorist organisation, freezes assets.\n\nFurther, Burhan Wani, the militant who was killed in an encounter with Indian security forces in 2015, was commander of the organisation.\n\nWhat is India's response?\n\nIndia has been urging the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to ban the Hizb and its chief, but the plea has been vetoed by China. The US's condemnation may help India's case at the UNSC now.\n\nWho is Syed Salahuddin?\n\nSalahuddin is a native of Budgam district in central Kashmir but is known to operate out of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. However, he has aided militancy in the state for the last 27 years by supplying arms and training to youth from PoK and sending them across the border to the Indian state. Salahuddin, who is listed in the NIA's most-wanted list, was designated a \"global terrorist\" by the US, hours ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with President Donald Trump in June.\n\nAlso read: Syed Salahuddin tells Pakistan channel: Have carried out many terror operations in India, can strike anytime\n\nThe 71-year-old also heads the United Jihad Council, the umbrella body to oversee active terror outfits in J&K.\n\nHow does this affect Pakistan?\n\nThis could be a huge blow for Pakistan, as it projects Salahuddin as a \"freedom fighter\" and a voice for the people of Kashmir. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had repeatedly praised Burhan Wani during his tenure as well, reported news agency PTI.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)\n\nFor all the latest What Is News, download Indian

The Trump administration's previous decision to designate Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin a \"global terrorist\" came just ahead of Modi's meeting with the US President in Washington in June.\n\nThe announcement is also read as a sign of US-India proximity on strategic issues at a time when Delhi is locked in a tense face-off with China near the Sikkim- Tibet-Bhutan tri-junction and is facing a daily dose of threatening statements from Beijing. The action also indicates that the US does not support China's efforts to protect terror groups sustained by Pakistan against international sanctions.\n\nThe US decision is seen as act of solidarity with India in its fight against terrorism and jihadi outfits operating out of Pakistan with the support of the Pakistani army and ISI. The decision, as in the case of Salahuddin, acknowledges India's arguments that the Hizbul and its leaders are terrorists rather than \"freedom fighters\" as claimed by Pakistan and separatists in J&K.\n\nThe US state department said in a statement that it has designated \"Hizbul Mujahideen - also known as Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, also known as HM - as a foreign terrorist organisation under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and as a specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) under section 1 (b) of executive order 13224\".\n\nThe Trump administration, which seems willing to act on its commitment on terrorism, said in its statement that declaring Hizbul Mujahideen a \"foreign terrorist organisation\" will have consequences like HM property and finances in the United States being blocked and a ban on American citizens engaging in any transactions with the group.\n\nHizbul is now in the same list as Al Qaeda, Islamic State, Boko Haram or other Pakistan-based anti-India terror outfits such as Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. India now has a strong chance to push its case for designating Syed Salahuddin and Hizbul Mujahideen as 'global outfits' in the United Nations Security Council.\n\nLately, India's efforts to designate terrorists such a Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar operating from Pakistan enlisted at UN have been vetoed by China.\n\nHibzul recently named Mohammad Bin Qasim as its new chief in Kashmir after the death of its operations chief Yasin Yatoo. The outfit has been particularly involved in a series of attacks on security forces deployed in Jammu and Kashmir in last one-and-a-half years. HM commander Burhan Wani was killed last year after which violence, in the form of stone pelting, spiraled in the valley.\n\nThe US state department statement said that Hizbul was formed in 1989 and is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir.\n\n\"Hizbul Mujahideen is led by specially designated global terrorist Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also known as Syed Salahuddin. Hizbul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including the April 2014 explosives attack in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which injured 17 people,\" the statement said.\n\nIt added, \"Today's action notifies the US public and the international community that HM is a terrorist organisation.\"\n\n\"Terrorism designations expose and isolate organisations and individuals, and deny them access to the US financial system. Moreover, designations can assist the law enforcement activities of US agencies and other governments,\" it said.\n\nOfficials in Indian government were happy with the move. Some said they had been engaging with the United States to declare HM as a global outfit and pressure Pakistan to take action against him.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with

In this connection, a formal order as \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT)\" was issued under section 1(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 13224.\n\n\"These designations seek to deny HM the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks. Among other consequences, all of HM's property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group\", the statement said.\n\nThe statement added that the HM, formed in 1989, is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir.\n\n\"Hizbul Mujahideen is led by Specially Designated Global Terrorist Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also known as Syed Salahuddin. Hizbul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including the April 2014 explosives attack in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which injured 17 people,\" the statement said.\n\nIt further said, \"Today's action notifies the US public and the international community that HM is a terrorist organization. Terrorism designations expose and isolate organizations and individuals, and deny them access to the US financial system. Moreover, designations can assist the law enforcement activities of US agencies and other governments\".\n\nThe US State Department had in June 2017 declared the PoK-based HM chief Muhammad Yusuf Shah alias Syed Salahuddin a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist'. He is a resident of Soibug in Jammu and Kashmir's central district of Budgam and crossed over to the other side of the Line of Control (LoC) in early 1990s.\n\nThe HM and Kashmiri separatist political parties had sharply reacted to it saying the move was \"highly unjustifiable and regrettable\".\n\nAn alliance of key separatist leaders- Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik- had said that Jammu and Kashmir is a \"disputed territory which was occupied by Indian illegally in 1947.\"\n\nThey had added, \"Since the people of the State are peacefully engaged in their struggle for freedom through self-determination as promised to them by United Nations and supported by the US, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world community (sic)\".\n\nIt further said, \"Whereas it is incumbent upon the international community including the US to honour this commitment made to the people of J&K that they would be granted the right of self-determination to decide their future and seek the settlement of the dispute which is bleeding Kashmiris each day and has led to their genocide under brutal Indian occupation besides making J&K the world's highest militarized zone with over eight lake Indian forces stationed here to keep the people captive\".\n\nThe alliance had claimed that the people of Kashmir are \"peacefully and resiliently resisting this occupation by a mighty military power and demanding their just right, despite the fact that all means and methods of resistance are barred to them by force\".\n\nIt had said, \"Their hope is that the international community which acknowledged and backed their legitimate right to self-determination in accordance with internationally accepted democratic norms and justice will always support their just struggle and eventually truth and justice will prevail\".\n\nThe Kashmir Valley had observed a one-day shutdown against the US move in response to a call issued by the alliance.", "id":

The designation of individuals or groups supporting the Kashmiris' right to self-determination as terrorist is completely unjustified,\" Zakaria said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department added Hizbul Mujahideen to its list of global \"terrorist\" organizations on Wednesday, saying the action is a bid to deny the group \"the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks.\" It said the group has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including a bombing in Kashmir more than two years ago that injured 17 people.\n\nThe designation blocks any assets Hizbul Mujahideen may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits Americans from doing business with it.\n\nSeveral hundred supporters of the group took to the streets Thursday in Muzafarabad, the central town of the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir, to denounce the U.S. decision.\n\nA prominent separatist leader in Indian Kashmir, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, expressed his disappointment at the U.S. decision, saying militant groups fighting Indian occupation should not be called terrorists.\n\n\"They are not global terrorist organizations who are attacking targets outside Kashmir or killing innocent people. Kashmir is an international dispute and we are seeking its resolution international pledges. But India is not ready to resolve this issue peacefully and is prolonging it,\" Farooq told the VOA Urdu service.\n\nHizbul Mujahideen was established in 1989. Its Pakistan-based founder, Syed Salahuddin, was designated a global \"terrorist\" by the U.S. in June. The militant leader swiftly denounced and rejected the action, vowing to continue fighting until India quits Kashmir.\n\nBoth Islamabad and New Delhi claim the region in its entirety and have fought two full-scale wars over the divided Himalayan region. It remains the primary source of bilateral tensions, with military clashes routinely taking place along the cease-fire line, or the Kashmir Line of Control.\n\nIndia has been struggling to restore normalcy and suppress a new wave of protests that has gripped the two-thirds of Kashmir under its control since July 2016 when Indian security forces, in an encounter, killed 22-year-old Burhan Wani, a popular commander of Hizbul Mujahideen.\n\nHuman rights groups have since accused Indian security forces of using brutal force in their bid to disperse stone-throwing crowds taking to the streets almost every day, and prompting authorities to occasionally impose a curfew and other restrictions.\n\nScores of people have died in clashes with security forces in the last year and thousands more have been wounded, deepening anti-India sentiment in Kashmir, where support is reportedly growing for armed fighters among the youth.\n\nIndia accuses Pakistan of supporting and arming Kashmiri separatists, a charge denied by Islamabad.", "id": "9796052", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Pakistan Slams US for Declaring Anti-India Kashmir Group as 'Terrorist'", "image": null,

He said neither abuses nor bullets would be enough to pacify the region and that the Kashmiris needed to be embraced instead.

The Trump administration's previous decision to designate Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin a \"global terrorist\" came just ahead of Modi's meeting with the US President in Washington in June. A day after US president Donald Trump called PM Narendra Modi to greet him on India's Independence Day, the US designated Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen, responsible for terrorist attacks in J&K for the last three decades, as a \"foreign terrorist organisation\".\n\nThe labelling of Hizbul as an FTO means the outfit will face financial sanctions. The Trump administration's previous decision to designate Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin a \"global terrorist\" came just ahead of Modi's meeting with the US President in Washington in June.\n\nThe announcement is also read as a sign of US-India proximity on strategic issues at a time when India is locked in a tense military face-off with China and is facing a daily dose of threatening statements from Beijing. The action against Hizb also indicates that the US does not support China's efforts to protect terror groups sustained by Pakistan against international sanctions.\n\nThe US designation of Hizbul Mujahideen as a \"foreign terrorist organisation\" seeks to deny it the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks, the State Department said in a media note announcing the move.Among other consequences, it said, all of HM's property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.\n\nThe move comes ahead of a widely-awaited review of South Asia strategy -involving Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India -which Trump will preside over on Friday at Camp David with vice-president Mike Pence and the National Security team.\n\nThe US decision is seen as an act of solidarity with India in its fight against terrorism and jihadi outfits operating out of Pakistan with the support of the Pakistani army and ISI. The decision, as in the case of Salahuddin, acknowledges India's arguments that the Hizbul and its leaders are terrorists rather than \"freedom fighters\" as claimed by Pakistan and separatists in J&K. Hizbul is now in the same list as Al Qaeda, Islamic State, Boko Haram or other Pakistan-based anti-India terror outfits such as Lashkar-eToiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad.India now has a strong chance to push its case for designating Syed Salahuddin and Hizbul Mujahideen as 'global terror outfits' in UN Security Council.\n\nClick here to watch the video\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9605730", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "US terms Hizbul Mujahideen a foreign terror outfit, seeks to choke its funding -

(Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi) US designates Hizbul Mujahideen as foreign terrorist organisation: Top developmentsAt least 10 youths weaned away from militancy in North Kashmir, let off after counseling: MHA reportWhat is the Hizbul Mujahideen?\n\nThe US Department of State has designated Hizbul Mujahideen as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" and \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\". The above designation seeks to \"deny HM the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks\" besides blocking Hizbul's property and interests subject to American jurisdiction and prohibiting persons from \"engaging in any transactions with the group.\"\n\nFrom an Indian perspective, what does the above designation mean? Will it affect Hizbul's functioning and prevent further recruitment within Kashmir Valley? Will it prevent Pakistan from supporting HM and Syed Salahudin?\n\nThough the Hizbul has been projected as the largest \"Kashmiri\" militant group, during the last decade and half, it had lost the appeal to a more radical section such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad. The latter are based in Pakistan and are lethal in terms of attacks and ideological orientation.\n\nFor New Delhi, the US designation is strategic and political. While Pakistan has been pushing hard to project \"Indian atrocities\" in the Kashmir Valley, the latest designation of the Hizbul, and the earlier US declaration of Syed Salahudin as a global terrorist (during Modi's visit to the US) makes a political point at global level. It shows, where the White House stands on the ongoing unrest in J&K; clearly, the Trump administration stands with New Delhi.\n\nDoes the American ban really matter to the militant groups and their patrons?\n\nFor India, the bigger challenge is Lashkar-e-Toiba. Earlier, the US has designated the following Pakistan-based groups as terrorist organisations: Harakat ul-Mujahidin (HuM), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), Lashkar-e-Jhanvi (LI), Ansal-al Islam (AI), Tehrike-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and Jundullah.\n\nOutside these Pakistan based organisations, LTTE in Sri Lanka, Harakat ul-Jihad-i-Islami - Bangladesh (HuJI-B) and Indian Mujahdeen (IM) were also designated by the US as terrorist organisations. While the LTTE disintegrated after the killing of Prabhakaran, the other two in Bangladesh and India declined due to state action and also their inability to sustain popular support.\n\nIn case of Pakistan-based groups, the above has not happened. While the HuM declined during the 1990s, LeT, TTP, LI and Jundullah continue to operate - with and outside the State patronage. The Lashkar in particular has been openly challenging the ban; recently, it even announced the formation of a political party. While Hafiz Saeed was repeatedly placed under house arrest, it has neither affected his position, nor curbed Lashkar's activities.\n\nWhile the ban provides a political scoring point for India against Pakistan, the latter is unlikely to take any effective measure to curb the Hizbul. If the American military pressure and economic carrots have not prevented Pakistan's Deep State to act against the Taliban and the Huqqanis, will the US designation against Hizbul make any effective change? Less likely. For rest of Pakistan, the Hizbul will remain a \"separatist\" group and not militant.\n\nWhat next for Hizbul and New Delhi?\n\nHizbul may find another name, as Lashkar transformed itself into Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD). Syed Salahuddin may be placed under house arrest within Pakistan.\n\nBut the real issue for New Delhi would be the support and activities of the militant groups inside Kashmir. The American designation is a success for the South Block at the diplomatic level. The long term challenge for New Delhi would be to expand this, leading to the total disintegration of militancy and prevent the emergence of Burhan Wanis. For this, the North Block and the Prime Minister's Office will have to work together and carry forward the international success into Srinagar and beyond.\n\nThe author is a Professor and Dean at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) Bangalore.

Salahuddin, who also heads the United Jihad Council and was designated a global terrorist by the US in June, largely operates from the Pakistani garrison city of Rawalpindi and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. (REUTERS)\n\nThe US designation of the Hizbul Mujahideen as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation has come a little late in the day, given that India has been flagging its concerns about the most powerful militant group in Jammu and Kashmir to the West for decades. However, the designation comes at a time when a rejuvenated Hizb, its ranks swollen by youngsters attracted to the cult of slain commander Burhan Wani, poses a serious threat in the state. The influx of these youngsters has also overturned the ratio of foreign fighters to local militants, which was earlier skewed by the presence of a large number of Pakistani terrorists affiliated to banned groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nMore significantly, the US designation will strengthen India's hands in exposing the duplicitous role played by Pakistan's security establishment in backing the militancy in Kashmir. The resurgence of the Hizb in the past few years has suited Islamabad, which has played up the \"Kashmiri face\" of the militancy after years of fomenting unrest through the Pakistani fighters in the ranks of the LeT and JeM. Former premier Nawaz Sharif and Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa are among the Pakistani leaders who have repeatedly held up Wani as a paragon of the so-called \"freedom movement\" in Kashmir. The fact remains that the top leadership of the Hizb is ensconced in Pakistan. Hizb chief Syed Salahuddin, who also heads the United Jihad Council and was designated a global terrorist by the US in June, largely operates from the Pakistani garrison city of Rawalpindi and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. At a time when the West and bodies such as the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force have already taken Pakistan to task for failing to act against terrorists such as LeT founder Hafiz Saeed, the designation of the Hizb and Salahuddin is bound to increase the pressure on Islamabad for giving a free run to terrorists operating from its soil. As the notification from the US state department points out, such terrorism designations \"expose and isolate organisations and individuals\".\n\nFor India, this is just a small victory in the continuing war against terrorism. Much more needs to be done to address the morass that is Jammu and Kashmir. Despite the BJP being part of the government in Kashmir, the state has lumbered from one crisis to the next while the state and central governments have shown little in the way of innovative thinking to address the spiraling violence and chaos on the ground. Perhaps Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown the way forward, when he spoke in his Independence Day speech about the problem being solved not by abuse or bullets, but by embracing all Kashmiris.", "id": "9705313", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "US censure for Hizb has come a little late in the day", "image": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/08/17/Pictures/muzaffarabad-salahuddin-supreme-commander-speaks-hizbul-mujahideen_20f5c42c-8350-11e7-aa81-8a4dce36eef3.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "R\u0101walpindi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "48300", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "label": {"eng": "R\u0101walpindi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "48650", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Azad Kashmir"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "48898", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad_Kashmir", "label": {"eng": "Azad Kashmir"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "54026", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir", "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "113913", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}, "id": "303326", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}, "id": "307776", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hizbul Mujahideen"}, "id": "307779", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hizbul_Mujahideen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "id": "307780", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}, "id": "309647", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "War on Terror"}, "id": "310769", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations"}, "id": "314554", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_State_Department_list_of_Foreign_Terrorist_Organizations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hafiz Muhammad Saeed"}, "id": "317097", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafiz_Muhammad_Saeed"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lashkar-e-Taiba"}, "id": "321846", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkar-e-Taiba"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kashmir conflict"}, "id": "324231", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sayeed Salahudeen"}, "id": "335573", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeed_Salahudeen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)"}, "id": "368456", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jaish-e-Mohammed"}, "id": "381749", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaish-e-Mohammed"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Jihad Council"}, "id": "504081", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Jihad_Council"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "14:06:00"}

Hizbul Mujahideen is the biggest terror group operating in the Kashmir Valley and has also been named in the FIR lodged by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with a case of terror funding in the region.\n\nIntelligence sources said that though the labelling of Hizbul Mujahideen would lead to financial sanctions but the catch was that the outfit did not follow any banking channel to fund its operations and most of its funds came through the illegal hawala network originating out of Pakistan.\n\nThe move, sources added, was more strategic in nature rather than actually having any major impact on the ground in terms of freezing Hizbul's flow of funds.\n\nFollowing the designation of Hizbul Mujahideen as a global terrorist organisation, all its property in the US jurisdiction would be blocked and all US nationals would be prohibited from carrying out any transactions, particularly financial, with the terror outfit.\n\nHizbul does not have any major resources, assets or properties under the US jurisdiction. But the move is symbolic and important in terms of the US expressing solidarity with India in the war against terrorism and subscribing to the viewpoint that Hizbul indeed was a major terror organisation, a senior intelligence official said.\n\nTop security and intelligence officials here claimed that they would now engage with their US counterparts in a bid to pressurise Pakistan to ensure that Hizbul's activities there were completely stopped.\n\nHizbul chief Syed Salahuddin operates out of Pakistan and is known to hold rallies and other events there to mobilise support and funds for terror operation in the Kashmir Valley. In addition, Hizbul is known to be operating terror camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\n\nSources said Hizbul did not collect funds through legal banking network and most of its donations of funding by Pakistan's security agencies like ISI was done using the hawala channels. The funds collected were then pumped into the Kashmir Valley for terror activities using the same network.\n\n\"Though this is an important announcement, it now needs to be followed up with more stringent action within Pakistan.

(Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi 14-08-2016) Hizbul Mujahideen ban goes global, but will it reach the Valley?US designates Hizbul Mujahideen as foreign terrorist organisation: Top developmentsWhat is the Hizbul Mujahideen?\n\nOn Wednesday, US State department declared Kashmir's largest indigenous militant group Hizbul Mujahideen as foreign terrorist organization. The decision comes a month after Mohammad Yusuf Shah, alias Syed Salahudin, was declared as global terrorist by the US state department. Salahudin, the chief commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, based in Muzaffarabad, PoK, is also the chairman of United Jihad Council (UJC) - an umbrella group of militant outfits operating in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nFor India, designation of Hizb as a foreign terror outfit is going to be a big diplomatic victory as it will also put Pakistan under pressure to rein in Hizb and its leadership in that country. India will sure use this as an opportunity to deal with the militants and their sympathizers in Kashmir with an iron hand, where militants are already feeling the heat of stepped up anti-militancy operations by the forces. The US decision may, however, embolden India further as human rights violation in the Valley could now be overlooked by the West.\n\nHowever, on ground in Kashmir, the US designation is not going to affect the militancy much, as has been seen in the case of Lashkar, which continued its lethal attacks against Indian forces in the Valley even after US ban. The Kashmiri militants who are fighting with Indian forces have never looked towards the US for help, nor they have any assets there or travel to US or other countries.\n\nFor common Kashmiris, who see their struggle as secular, legal and a fight for restoration of plebiscite rights as envisaged under UN resolutions, the US ban is going to serve more as a psychological setback as for decades people have been looking towards the US for its support and intervention in resolving Kashmir issue. After this decision, majority of people here may realize that US is, in no way, going to support any sort of armed struggle in Kashmir whether run by locals or foreign cadres of any militant outfit.\n\nAlso, in Kashmir this decision is seen as a major shift in the US policy towards Pakistan and the Kashmir issue and also a favour to India.\n\nEarlier, people here had pinned their hopes on the US considering Pakistan as its staunch ally. Many people here also see it as a diplomatic failure of Pakistan government in mobilising support for Kashmir's indigenous struggle at the global level, especially when people are being killed and maimed in the Valley, with alleged human rights by the government forces on rise. Formed 28 years ago, Hizbul Mujahideen is one of the oldest indigenous militant outfits having presence in both parts of Kashmir, with a dedicated cadre and good network of over ground workers in every village and town of that has helped this organization to survive even the toughest military onslaught and killing of thousands of cadres and supporters over the years.\n\nIn Kashmir when militants were on run and numbers of both foreign and local militants were depleting, it was Hizbul Mujahideen that is credited with the resurgence of militancy, especially its operational commander, Burhan Muzaffar Wani who used social media to promote militancy and managed to draw fresh cadres from local youths towards this group.\n\nAfter the killing of Wani last year when dozens of local boys joined militancy after many years, the number of local militants surpassed foreigners and Hizb again became a strong militancy group with a capability to strike anywhere in Kashmir. Unlike other militant groups operating in Kashmir, Hizb had no global agenda and it remained confined to Kashmir and India alone. Recently, Salahudin and its other senior commanders based in Valley have been constantly asking people to stay away from the influence of al Qaeda and Islamic State (IS), especially after former Hizbul Mujahideen militant and close aide of Burhan Wani, Zakir Musa who set up his own organization named as - Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind - believed to be linked with al Qaeda.\n\nHowever, the fillip side of the US ban is that more and more Kashmiri youth may get attracted towards the radical militant organizations like al Qaeda or ISIS or may force Hizb to drop its opposition to the entry of these organisation into Kashmir Jihad.\n\nIn the past, Hizb and its political patrons like the Hurriyat Conference have been hoping on the intervention of western powers especially the United States for any resolution, however this could now change in the coming months and the US could be replaced with other powers like China and Russia.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express

briefing, FO spokesperson Nafees Zakaria had said that Kashmiris' struggle for their right to self-determination has been rightfully continuing for the past 70 years.\n\nHe had also noted that Indian

ANI\n\nThis move, a symbolic victory for India, comes just months after HM supremo Syed Salahuddin was designated a \"global terrorist\".\n\nThis is particularly important because even as the US has shown a willingness to target anti-India terrorist groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan, it had hesitated to show the same willingness for a Kashmiri terror group.\n\nWhile this was amenable for the Indian policymakers in the initial years of India-US strategic relationship, New Delhi could no longer turn a blind eye towards US reluctance.\n\nParticularly as the HM, after remaining a depleted organisation for most of the late 2000s, acquired a renewed vigour post-2012 and specifically after the turbulent period of mass protests in Kashmir between 2008 and 2011.\n\nTherefore this designation matters, even if it makes little practical difference to the HM's activities in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the Valley. Syed Salahuddin, for instance, despite being designated as a global terrorist and under the radar of the Western intelligence agencies, still makes public appearances and continues to call for violence against India.\n\nThe designation also comes at a particularly difficult time for the HM as it is trying to maintain its recent ascendancy in the Valley and protect its turf from other terrorist groups such as the LeT, JeM and the recently formed Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, an affiliate of Al-Qaeda.\n\nWhile the group is getting a steady stream of recruits post the killing of Burhan Wani, sustaining these recruits and maintaining their expenses requires money.\n\nBut this is where the designation, combined with the recent crackdown by the National Investigation Agency on the separatist-terrorist funding nexus will hit the HM where it hurts: India is sure to use the designation to galvanise support against financing of terror outfits.\n\nOf course, terrorist organisations such as the HM have sources of money outside the formal financial system -- which the US designations typically tend to target -- such as hawala.\n\nAnd that is an ongoing battle: As evident from the NIA's cases against the HM and efforts to develop closer relationship with like-minded countries in the Persian Gulf from where donations from religious charities make their way to Pakistan-based terror groups.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 09:38 am | Updated Date: Aug 17, 2017 09:47 am\n\nTags :#Connectthedots#Hizbul mujahideen#Kashmir#Nawaz sharif#Newstracker#Pakistan#Syed

\"global terrorist organisation\" in an attempt to choke off financial and other support to it.\n\nThe State Department announced in Washington on Wednesday that HM, which carries out attacks in Kashmir, has been designated as both a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group under two different regulations.\n\nThe action follows the designation of HM's

needs to carry out terrorist attacks.\"\n\nAs a result, any property or financial interests in the US or where it has jurisdiction are blocked and people are prohibited from aiding it.\n\nCalling HM \"one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir\", the Department noted that Salahuddin had claimed responsibility for several attacks including one in 2014 in Kashmir that

The train stops at the station in these cities so that people can visit the galliers.\n\nThe sacrifices of Pakistan's armed forces and \"Indian aggression in Indian-held Kashmir\" have been displayed in the picture galleries, APP reported.\n\nPhotos published in the Pakistani media show that at least one coach is dedicated to depicting the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. This coach is emblazoned with the slogan \"Save Kashmir\" and features a larger-than-life image of Burhan Wani, the Hizbul Mujahideen commander who was killed by security forces a year ago.\n\nPakistan's civil and military leadership, including former premier Nawaz Sharif and army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa, have angered India by referring to Wani as a leader of the \"freedom movement\" in Kashmir.\n\nThe Azadi Train, which is scheduled to conclude its journey in the port city of Karachi on August 25 after travelling through Balochistan and Sindh provinces, is making its way across Pakistan at a time when the US state department has designated the Hizbul Mujahideen as a foreign terrorist organisation and a specially designated global terrorist group.\n\nThe designation, announced on Wednesday, came less than two months after Pakistan-based Hizb chief Syed Salahuddin, was also designated a global terrorist.\n\nOn Thursday, Pakistan said it was disappointed by what it described as the \"unjustified\" decision by the US to designate the Hizbul Mujahideen as a foreign terrorist organisation.\n\n\"The designation of individuals or groups supporting the Kashmiri right to self-determination as terrorists is completely unjustified,\" foreign ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria told a news briefing in Islamabad.\n\nHe reiterated Pakistan's \"moral, diplomatic and political support to Kashmiri people's struggle\".\n\nThe Azadi Train also featured images of Burhan Wani at the time of its inaugural journey in August last year. It coaches also feature images of past prime ministers, including Yousaf Raza Gilani, Benazir Bhutto, Nawaz Sharif and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.", "id": "9877082", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18",

The US said that this decision was to seek to deny HM the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks. The notification by the US Department of State says Hizbul Mujahideen, formed in 1989, is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir.\n\n\"Hizbul Mujahideen is led by Specially Designated Global Terrorist Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also known as Syed Salahuddin. Hizbul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including the April 2014, explosives attack in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which injured 17 people,\" it said.\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, readying for a visit to Washington, on Thursday did not comment directly on the US decision but instead stated that Pakistan shall continue to extend political, diplomatic and moral support for the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for realisation of the right to self-determination and the peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nIn a statement, he warned that New Delhi should read the writing on the wall that its repressive policies can never succeed in suppressing the Kashmiris from demanding the right to self-determination confirmed to them by UN Security Council resolutions.\n\n\"Neither Indian presence in IHK, nor its brutal actions against defenceless Kashmiris are lawful. The 70-year-old indigenous struggle of Kashmiris in Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir remains legitimate.\n\nThe designation of individuals or groups supporting the Kashmiri right to self-determination as terrorists is completely unjustified. The gross and systematic violation of human rights of the Kashmiri people in IHK that have been recorded and reported by independent human rights bodies is a reality\", the Foreign Minister added.\n\nHe urged the world community and human rights organizations to take notice of the deteriorating human rights situation in IHK and invited the attention of the UN Secretary General towards the Indian nefarious designs of bringing demographic changes in IHK in order to convert the Muslim majority of the area into minority.\n\n\"These include abrogation of Article 35-A of Indian constitution, settlement of West Pakistan Refugees, giving land to non-Kashmiri industrialists, and establishment of Sainik colonies. These actions are in complete violation of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as international law and norms, which prohibit bringing material changes to a disputed territory\", he said while noting that the intended demographic changes would undermine the prospects of holding a free and fair plebiscite in the IHK required by UNSC resolutions.\n\nEarlier the Foreign Office while expressing \"disappointment\" over the latest US decision pointed to Hindu terrorist organizations that are perpetrating terrorist attacks in India and blaming it on others.\n\n\"How long will the conscience of the fair-minded remain unaffected? We have flagged our concerns with regard to Indian involvement in subversive and terrorist activities, as well as espionage within Pakistan, as Commander Kulbhushan Jhadev himself testified. We also raise the issue of use of Afghan soil by India to perpetrate terrorism in Pakistan, with not only the US but also many other countries.\n\nIn the context of Indian involvement in terrorism and terror financing in Pakistan, we have also submitted dossiers to UN Secretary General\", the spokesman told the weekly media briefing.\n\nHe also pointed out to the fact that Hurriyat leaders Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Yaseen Malik, Shabbir Ahmed Shah, Aasiya Andrabi, Mussarat Alam Bhat, Fahmeeda Sofi, etc. were facing threats to their lives while in detention/house arrest in the IHK.\n\n\"They have been deprived of life saving medicines and Shabbir Ahmad Shah has also received threats to his life in the infamous Tihar jail. He has been kept with dangerous inmates. Indian forces are in contravention of all human rights conventions on human rights and right to life as well as the UN Charter\", the spokesman added. In a response to a query, the spokesman said the visit of Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua was helpful in setting the direction to our bilateral relations.\n\n\"This was not a one-off meeting; we have regular institutionalized mechanism in place, whereby bilateral political consultations take place. This was second meeting in consecutive years. You are also aware that earlier exchanges and high level contacts between Pakistan and Afghanistan were instrumental in increasing cooperation between the two sides and developing better understanding of each other's issues\", he said.\n\nIn this regard, he pointed to previous interactions including London meeting between former Adviser Sartaj Aziz and Afghan NSA Hanif Atmar, parliamentary exchanges, Astana meeting between the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ashraf Ghani on the sidelines of SCO Summit, and participation in the Kabul process.", "id": "9799660",

Syed Salahuddin, for instance, despite being designated as a global terrorist and under the radar of the Western intelligence agencies, still makes public appearances and continues to call for violence against India.\n\nThe designation also comes at a particularly difficult time for the HM as it is trying to maintain its recent ascendancy in the Valley and protect its turf from other terrorist groups such as the LeT, JeM and the recently formed Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, an affiliate of Al-Qaeda.\n\nWhile the group is getting a steady stream of recruits post the killing of Burhan Wani, sustaining these recruits and maintaining their expenses requires money.\n\nBut this is where the designation, combined with the recent crackdown by the National Investigation Agency on the separatist-terrorist funding nexus will hit the HM where it hurts: India is sure to use the designation to galvanise support against financing of terror outfits.\n\nOf course, terrorist organisations such as the HM have sources of money outside the formal financial system -- which the US designations typically tend to target -- such as hawala.\n\nAnd that is an ongoing battle: As evident from the NIA's cases against the HM and efforts to develop closer relationship with like-minded countries in the Persian Gulf from where donations from religious charities make their way to Pakistan-based terror groups.", "id": "9612507", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "US labels Hizbul Mujahideen a global terror outfit: Move freezes its assets, will hit them where it hurts most -

Among other consequences, it said, all of HM's property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.\n\nThe designation come ahead of a widely-awaited review of South Asia strategy -- involving Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India -- which President Trump will preside over on Friday at Camp David with vice-president Mike Pence and the National Security team.\n\nThe Trump administration has extended and toughened Washington's hardline policy towards Pakistan that began during the Obama years in view of the country's double dealing and backing of terrorist groups despite taking billions in U.S aid. Pakistan has also continued its brazen support to terrorists in Kashmir terming them ''freedom fighters.''\n\nAmong its proteges are Hizbul Mujaheddin chief Syed Salahuddin who was named as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S State Department just ahead Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with President Trump at the White House in June.\n\nThe designations also serve notice to China, which has consistently thwarted India's - and American -- efforts to have the United Nations ban Pakistan-based Jaish-E-Mohammed terrorist Masood Azhar.\n\nPakistan-based terrorist groups have exported their extremist violence to China's Uighur region and Beijing has retaliated against Islamists by hounding them to the extent of even banning naming of children Mohammed.\n\nDespite such religious and ideological ill-will, China has lately teamed with Pakistan to give cover to terrorism directed against India.\n\nWhatever his other domestic disasters, Trump had promised to address the issue of terrorism directed against India and his administration has so far been pro-active in banning terror groups and putting the squeeze on Pakistan. The Trump administration is also whittling down aid to Pakistan.\n\nAfter President Obama disdained from visiting Pakistan during his two terms, Trump did not even bother to call or greet Pakistan on the occasion of its Independence Day, signaling a continuing deterioration of Washington ties with Islamabad.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9542553", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Sanction on Hizbul Mujahideen: A widely-awaited review of US South Asia strategy - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "2", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "65436", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}, "id": "302950", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}, "id": "303326", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamism"}, "id": "304453", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}, "id": "304965", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hizbul Mujahideen"}, "id": "307779", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hizbul_Mujahideen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "id": "307780", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "313490", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mujahideen"}, "id": "314543", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations"}, "id": "314554", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_State_Department_list_of_Foreign_Terrorist_Organizations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir"}, "id": "317221", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency_in_Jammu_and_Kashmir"}, {"label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}, "id": "330537", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sayeed Salahudeen"}, "id": "335573", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeed_Salahudeen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Masood Azhar"}, "id": "457347", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masood_Azhar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Specially Designated Global Terrorist"}, "id": "811724", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specially_Designated_Global_Terrorist"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}], "time": "18:32:00"}

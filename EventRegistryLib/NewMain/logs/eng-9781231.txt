These accessories help them maintain precision and focus during the procedure. But when they have raw talent, an athlete will need no gear to shine on the big stage. A veteran pistol shooter from Turkey has proven this point at the Paris Olympics. Yusuf Dikec claimed the silver medal by finishing second in the mixed 10m Air Pistol shooting, an event where India's Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh won the bronze medal match. Dikec paired up with Sevval Ilayda Tarhan in Paris.\n\nNot only his sports achievement but Yusuf Dikec is also going viral for appearing in the competition with minimal gear. While his teammate and other participants donned specialised goggles and high-end ear protection, Dikec ditched them all. Instead, he opted for regular prescription glasses and wore simple earplugs for the bullet noise.\n\nA particular picture has gained huge attention on social media where Yusuf Dikec could be seen aiming at his target with one hand in his pocket. The photograph went widely viral, sparking a meme fest across the internet. Dropping it on X (formerly Twitter), one user wrote, \"Turkey sent a 51-year-old guy with no specialized lenses, eye cover or ear protection and got the silver medal.\"\n\n\"Did Turkey send a hitman to the Olympics?\" asked a person, sharing a picture of Yusuf Dikec.\n\nAnother person revealed the details of the gear a shooter uses at the Olympics. \"In Olympic shooting, they use equipment like a lens to avoid blur, a lens for better precision and ear protectors for noise. Then a Turkish guy (Dikec) came and won a silver medal with just a pair of glasses,\" he added.\n\nHere are some other reactions:\n\nYusuf Dikec made his Olympics debut in 2008 in Beijing. Since then, he has featured in every edition of the mega event.

Serbia won the gold medal, while Turkey and India won the silver and the bronze respectively.\n\nCHATEAUROUX, France (AP) -- Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec has gone viral on social media for his seemingly casual attitude while shooting his way to a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe most-shared images show Dikec shooting in a T-shirt with one hand in his pocket, a seemingly standard pair of glasses and an impassive look on his face. He's been likened to a regular guy competing at the Olympics, or even a hitman.\n\nThe 51-year-old is no newcomer, though. He's competed at every Summer Olympics since 2008.\n\nSome memes contrast Dikec with his Serbian opponent Damir Mikec, who was wearing a blinder over one eye, a lens over the other and a large pair of ear defenders.\n\nDid Dikec win a medal?\n\nHe did, and it made history.\n\nDikec and Sevval Ilayda Tarhan won the silver medal in mixed team 10-meter air pistol shooting Tuesday. It was Turkey's first-ever medal in Olympic shooting.\n\nMikec and Zorana Arunovic won gold for Serbia. The bronze went to India's Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh.\n\nUnlike Dikec, his teammate Tarhan was competing with large ear defenders and a visor, as well as braids in the red and white colors of the Turkish flag. She was shooting with one hand in her pocket, too.\n\nDikec was 13th in his individual event and is now done at the Paris Olympics. He's looking ahead to the next Games in 2028, though. \"I hope next in Los Angeles (for) a gold medal,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nWhat does he think about going viral?\n\nDikec seems to be embracing the trend, reposting a video compilation of Turkish-language memes about him to his Instagram page.\n\nThe shooting events were held around three hours' drive south of Paris. Dikec and Tarhan made the journey to the French capital Wednesday, where they were greeted with cheers at the Champions Park, an open-air venue where medalists celebrate with fans.\n\nWhy didn't Dikec wear more gear?\n\nShooters have some freedom about how they dress for competition.\n\nMany shooters at the Olympic range in Chateauroux, central France, choose to wear visors to reduce the glare of the lights or so-called blinders over one eye to get a better focus for the eye which is looking down the sights.\n\nIt's not quite true that Dikec wasn't wearing any shooting gear. He had yellow earplugs to block out distractions while he shot in the final. They just weren't visible from the angle of the image which went viral.\n\nJust like Dikec, Chinese rifle shooter Liu Yukun won a gold medal Thursday wearing earplugs but no blinder or visor.\n\nHave other shooters gone viral at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nYes, South Korean pistol shooter Kim Yeji's confident demeanor and dramatic stance have brought praise on social media for her \"main character energy\".\n\n\"The Olympic #shootingsport stars we didn't know we needed,\" the official Olympics account on X posted Thursday with pictures of Kim and Dikec.\n\nKim won silver in the women's 10-meter air pistol event Sunday behind her South Korean teammate Oh Ye Jin. Kim and Oh are roommates and Kim said she was pleased Oh got the gold because she sees her like a \"youngest sibling\".\n\nKim is set to compete again Friday in qualification for the women's 25-meter pistol event.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors":

A photograph capturing the 51-year-old athlete taking aim with one hand in his pocket and minimal gear has gone viral across social media platforms.\n\nOn X, formerly known as Twitter, a post featuring the photograph has amassed an astonishing 71 million views. The caption reads, \"Turkey sent a 51-year-old guy with no specialised lenses, eye cover or ear protection and got the silver medal.\"\n\nIn stark contrast to his competitors, who were equipped with specialised gear including goggles, lenses to prevent blur, and ear protectors for noise reduction, Dikec opted for a more relaxed approach. Wearing prescription glasses and standard earplugs, he exuded casual confidence, which resonated widely on social media.\n\nMemes and jokes about Dikec have since flooded social media.

He's been likened to a regular guy competing at the Olympics, or even a hitman.\n\nThe 51-year-old is no newcomer, though. He's competed at every Summer Olympics since 2008.\n\nSome memes contrast Dikec with his Serbian opponent Damir Mikec, who was wearing a blinder over one eye, a lens over the other and a large pair of ear defenders.\n\nDid Dikec win a medal?\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nHe did, and it made history.\n\nDikec and Sevval Ilayda Tarhan won the silver medal in mixed team 10-meter air pistol shooting Tuesday. It was Turkey's first-ever medal in Olympic shooting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMikec and Zorana Arunovic won gold for Serbia. The bronze went to India's Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh.\n\nUnlike Dikec, his teammate Tarhan was competing with large ear defenders and a visor, as well as braids in the red and white colors of the Turkish flag. She was shooting with one hand in her pocket, too.\n\nDikec was 13th in his individual event and is now done at the Paris Olympics. He's looking ahead to the next Games in 2028, though. \"I hope next in Los Angeles (for) a gold medal,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nWhat does he think about going viral?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDikec seems to be embracing the trend, reposting a video compilation of Turkish-language memes about him to his Instagram page.\n\nThe shooting events were held around three hours' drive south of Paris. Dikec and Tarhan made the journey to the French capital Wednesday, where they were greeted with cheers at the Champions Park, an open-air venue where medalists celebrate with fans.\n\nWhy didn't Dikec wear more gear?\n\nShooters have some freedom about how they dress for competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany shooters at the Olympic range in Chateauroux, central France, choose to wear visors to reduce the glare of the lights or so-called blinders over one eye to get a better focus for the eye which is looking down the sights.\n\nIt's not quite true that Dikec wasn't wearing any shooting gear. He had yellow earplugs to block out distractions while he shot in the final. They just weren't visible from the angle of the image which went viral.\n\nJust like Dikec, Chinese rifle shooter Liu Yukun won a gold medal Thursday wearing earplugs but no blinder or visor.\n\nHave other shooters gone viral at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, South Korean pistol shooter Kim Yeji's confident demeanor and dramatic stance have brought praise on social media for her \"main character energy\".\n\n\"The Olympic #shootingsport stars we didn't know we needed,\" the official Olympics account on X posted Thursday with pictures of Kim and Dikec.\n\nKim won silver in the women's 10-meter air pistol event Sunday behind her South Korean teammate Oh Ye Jin.

No eye gear and hand in pocket, this 51-year-old shooter wins silver at Paris Olympics", "body": "Social media exploded over a photo of Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec during the 10-meter air pistol mixed team event at the Paris Olympics. At 51 years old, Dikec and his partner, Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, secured the silver medal, but it was Dikec's unique approach that captured widespread attention.\n\nThe image showing Dikec competing in an unusually relaxed manner, with one hand in his pocket and lacking standard shooting gear, went viral. Unlike most Olympic shooters, who use ear protection and specialized glasses to block vision in one eye and reduce glare, Dikec's casual style stood out. A fan tweeted, \"Turkey sent a 51-year-old dude with no specialized lenses, eye cover, or ear protection, and secured the silver medal.\" Billionaire Elon Musk responded with a simple, \"Nice.\"\n\nIn the final match, Serbia's Zorana Arunovic and Damir Mikec clinched the gold medal, defeating the Turkish duo 16-14 at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre. Despite a slow start, Tarhan and Dikec managed to build an 8-4 lead and were close to victory at 14-12. However, Arunovic and Mikec made a remarkable comeback to win the gold.\n\nIndian shooters Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh made history by winning the bronze medal in the 10m air pistol mixed team event. This achievement marked India's sixth Olympic medal in shooting and its first-ever in a team event. Manu Bhaker also became the first athlete from independent India to win two medals in a single Olympic Games. Earlier in the week, Bhaker had made history as the first Indian woman to win an Olympic shooting medal. Competing at the National Shooting Center in Chateauroux, Bhaker and Singh triumphed over South Korea's Oh Ye Jin and Wonho Lee with a score of 16-10 in the bronze medal match.\n\nHe studied at Gazi University School of Physical Training and Education in Ankara and later earned a Master's in Coaching from Selcuk University in Konya. Dikec is fluent in both English and Turkish. He has competed in the Olympics four times, representing Turkey in 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. At the World Championships, he became a double world champion in 2014, winning in both the 25m standard pistol and the 25m center fire pistol events. Additionally, Dikec earned a silver medal in the 10m air pistol. In the European Championships, he has claimed seven titles, including a win in the air pistol trio event in 2024 in Gyor.

He's been likened to a regular guy competing at the Olympics, or even a hitman.\n\nThe 51-year-old is no newcomer, though. He's competed at every Summer Olympics since 2008.\n\nSome memes contrast Dikec with his Serbian opponent Damir Mikec, who was wearing a blinder over one eye, a lens over the other and a large pair of ear defenders.\n\nHe did, and it made history.\n\nDikec and Sevval Ilayda Tarhan won the silver medal in mixed team 10-meter air pistol shooting Tuesday. It was Turkey's first-ever medal in Olympic shooting.\n\nMikec and Zorana Arunovic won gold for Serbia. The bronze went to India's Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh.\n\nUnlike Dikec, his teammate Tarhan was competing with large ear defenders and a visor, as well as braids in the red and white colors of the Turkish flag. She was shooting with one hand in her pocket, too.\n\nDikec was 13th in his individual event and is now done at the Paris Olympics. He's looking ahead to the next Games in 2028, though. \"I hope next in Los Angeles (for) a gold medal,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nDikec seems to be embracing the trend, reposting a video compilation of Turkish-language memes about him to his Instagram page.\n\nThe shooting events were held around three hours' drive south of Paris. Dikec and Tarhan made the journey to the French capital Wednesday, where they were greeted with cheers at the Champions Park, an open-air venue where medalists celebrate with fans.\n\nShooters have some freedom about how they dress for competition.\n\nMany shooters at the Olympic range in Chateauroux, central France, choose to wear visors to reduce the glare of the lights or so-called blinders over one eye to get a better focus for the eye which is looking down the sights.\n\nIt's not quite true that Dikec wasn't wearing any shooting gear. He had yellow earplugs to block out distractions while he shot in the final. They just weren't visible from the angle of the image which went viral.\n\nJust like Dikec, Chinese rifle shooter Liu Yukun won a gold medal Thursday wearing earplugs but no blinder or visor.\n\nYes, South Korean pistol shooter Kim Yeji's confident demeanor and dramatic stance have brought praise on social media for her \"main character energy\".\n\n\"The Olympic #shootingsport stars we didn't know we needed,\" the official Olympics account on X posted Thursday with pictures of Kim and Dikec.\n\nKim won silver in the women's 10-meter air pistol event Sunday behind her South Korean teammate Oh Ye Jin. Kim and Oh are roommates and Kim said she was pleased Oh got the gold because she sees her like a \"youngest sibling\".\n\nKim is set to compete again Friday in qualification for the women's 25-meter pistol event.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

However, Dikec became a sensation overnight after his images and videos went viral on social media for not wearing a lot of gear that athletes wear for better precision, accuracy and protection of eyes and ears.\n\nShooters wear plenty of equipment during the event which includes specialised glasses for better precision and avoid any kind of blurring in eyes, and ear-protectors for noise cancellation. Dikec flaunted his aura by not wearing any of the gadgets while competing in the men's 10m air pistol event final and clinching the silver medal for the country.\n\nThe incident caught the attention of the shooting fans and social media went crazy as the 51-year-old went viral all over the internet. Dikec and his partner Sevval Ilayda Tarhan finished in second place in the 10-meter air pistol team event.\n\nThe Turkish shooter wore regular prescription glasses and earplugs and still defeated most of the competition. He aimed at the goal with one hand in his pocket and nailed his shots.\n\nDikec, who is featured in his fifty Olympic Games, had participated in the men's 10m Air Pistol individual event as well but failed to qualify for the final as he finished 13th. He managed to win his first-ever Olympic medal in the most comfortable style after a decorated career with the pistol.\n\nThe final of the shooting event was a closely fought affair with Serbian shooters Zorana Arunovic and Damir Mikec making an exceptional comeback to secure the gold medal. The Serbian duo Mikec recovered from six deficit points and thrashed the Turkish duo 16-14 in the summit clash.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Dike\u00e7", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yusuf Dike\u00e7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSF_10_meter_air_pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ISSF 10 meter air pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorana_Arunovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zorana Arunovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damir_Mikec", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damir Mikec"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earplug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earplug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/01-08-2024/1200-675-22099951-356-22099951-1722495885928.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9781231", "eventUri": "eng-9781231", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

With just his prescription glasses and simple earplugs, the 51-year-old shot his way to the silver medal with his partner Sevval Ilayda Tarhan.\n\nSevval Ilayda Tarhan (left) also had her left hand in her pocket while competing at the 10m air pistol mixed team event in the Chateauroux Shooting Centre in Deols, France on Tuesday, 30 July, with her partner Yusuf Dikec.\n\nImage via Amr Alfiky/Reuters\n\nSevval Ilayda Tarhan and Yusuf Dikec (left) won silver in the 10m air pistol mixed team event on Tuesday, 30 July.\n\nImage via Amr Alfiky/Reuters\n\nThe Internet has called him everything from an assassin and hitman to \"someone who just came out of the crowd\". Photos of him have gone viral with millions of views on X.\n\nThe standard stance for air pistol shooting involves standing slightly sideways to the target, holding the pistol with one hand, and keeping the other hand by their side or tucked into a belt for balance and stability.\n\nAs much as we like to believe that Dikec is a secret government agent sharpshooter, he is actually an athlete who has participated in the Olympics five times\n\nHe made his Olympic debut at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and his silver medal win on Tuesday, 30 July, was his first-ever podium finish, reported USA Today.\n\nHe and Tarhan gave their Serbian opponents a difficult match, narrowly missing out on the gold medal with a final score of 16-14.\n\nDikec went viral after South Korean Kim Ye-ji was dubbed 'the coolest person ever' during the 10m air pistol women's event.\n\nJust like Dikec, Kim was photographed with her left hand in her pocket during the competition.\n\nCheck out more #olympics stories on SAYS:\n\nDon't miss out on Malaysia's top stories!\n\nWe'll send a list to your inbox, once a day.\n\nSubscribe now!\n\nThank you!\n\nHappy to have you on board!

Dikec's casual approach intrigued spectators and showcased a different way to compete, with the typical shooting gear being nonexistent on the 51-year-old. Dikec's background in sports and fluency in English add to his charm and viral sensation status.\n\nThe Olympics are renowned for being the world's foremost sports competition, uniting athletes from every corner of the globe to compete in a wide range of events. Every four years, they are celebrated for their spirit of international unity and sportsmanship, where competitors' ultimate aim is to achieve that all-important gold medal.\n\nAt the Paris 2024 Games, it's also helped lesser-watched sports to gain more recognition, while teaching spectators about the curiosity of different cultures and amazing individuals. This is nowhere better illustrated than in the shooting after social media exploded over a photo of Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec during the 10-meter air pistol mixed team event.\n\nAt 51 years old, Dikec and his partner, Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, secured silver, but it was Dikec's unique approach that captured widespread attention, with the image showing Dikec competing in an unusually relaxed manner.\n\nRelated Paris 2024 Olympics Medals Tracker\n\nStay up to date with the leading nations in the medal table at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n2 Turkish Shooter is Olympics' New Viral Sensation Not all heroes wear capes\n\nUnlike most Olympic shooters, who use ear protection and specialized glasses to block vision in one eye and reduce glare, Dikec's casual style stood out, and it adds to a long-running theme of this year's thirst for knowledge in several areas of this summer's showpiece sporting event.\n\nWhile questions have already been raised about why the diving pool has water sprayed on it during performances, or why there's no Team GB football team, Dikec's unique style, which sees him use prescription glasses instead of the specialised ones his rivals wear, has increased the intrigue around who he is and what his background is.\n\nAccording to The Economic Times, he studied at Gazi University School of Physical Training and Education in Ankara and later earned a Master's in Coaching from Selcuk University in Konya. Dikec is also fluent in both English and Turkish, and he has competed in the Olympics five times, representing Turkey in 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020 and 2024.\n\nAt the World Championships, he became a double world champion in 2014, winning in both the 25m standard pistol and the 25m center fire pistol events. Additionally, Dikec earned a silver medal in the 10m air pistol. In the European Championships, he has claimed seven titles, including a win in the air pistol trio event in 2024 in Gyor.\n\nIn the same report, the 51-year-old is reported to enjoy dancing in his free time, which would suggest the writing was already on the wall for him to become a viral sensation, with a future career in TikTok not out of sight just yet.\n\nReaction on Social Media Dikec becomes unexpected star of the games\n\nNot only will Yusuf Dikec go home with a silver medal around his neck following Paris 2024, but he will surely be given a heroes welcome as he's quickly become one of the most-loved athletes competing this summer. One user wrote on Twitter: \"I love how everyone uses specialised lenses for shooting to avoid blur and increase precision. But then Turkey sends out a guy who looks like he just picked up the gun for fun and wins silver.\"\n\n\"This is what you call aura,\" another penned. \"Looking like he just came out of the crowd and gave it a go ... he just casually took home silver at the Olympics.\"\n\n\"Dude looks like he just decided to join the Olympics when he woke up this morning,\" joked a third. While a fourth added: \"He came in with both eyes open and one of his hand in his pocket.\"\n\nAnother fan tweeted: \"Turkey sent a 51-year-old dude with no specialized lenses, eye cover, or ear protection, and secured the silver medal,\" which encouraged billionaire Elon Musk to respond with a simple \"Nice.\"", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Despite his casual appearance, the 51-year-old is a seasoned Olympian, having participated in every Summer Olympics since 2008.\n\nDikec and his teammate Sevval Ilayda Tarhan made history by winning Turkey's first-ever Olympic medal in shooting, securing the silver in the mixed team 10-meter air pistol event on Tuesday.Serbia's Damir Mikec and Zorana Arunovic claimed the gold, while India's Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh took the bronze.\n\nUnlike Dikec, Tarhan competed with ear defenders, a visor, and braids in the colours of the Turkish flag, while also shooting with one hand in her pocket.\n\nLooking ahead to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Dikec expressed his hope for a gold medal. He said , \"I hope next in Los Angeles (for) a gold medal\".\n\nHe has embraced his newfound internet fame, sharing a compilation of Turkish-language memes about himself on his Instagram page. The shooting events took place in Chateauroux, central France, and the medallists were greeted with cheers at the Champions Park in Paris on Wednesday.\n\nShooters have some flexibility in their attire during competition, with many opting for visors to reduce glare or blinders to improve focus.\n\nAlthough not immediately visible, Dikec was wearing yellow earplugs to minimise distractions during the final. Similarly, Chinese rifle shooter Liu Yukun won a gold medal on Thursday wearing earplugs but no blinder or visor.\n\nSouth Korean pistol shooter Kim Yeji has also garnered attention on social media for her confident demeanor and dramatic stance, with the official Olympics account on X praising both Kim and Dikec as \"The Olympic #shootingsport stars we didn't know we needed.\"\n\nHere are a few viral tweets on Yusuf Dikec:\n\nA social media user compared him to Hollywood movie character 'John Wick' for his natural shooting skills.\n\nAnother user wrote, \" South Korea sent fully dressed shooter and Turkey sent a 51 years old In T Shirt hand in pocket while shooting And Turkish guy got silver Medal\".\n\nAnother user wrote, \"girls packing for a trip vs guys packing for a trip\" referring to Yusuf Dikec casual style.\n\nAnother user wrote, \"I think I'm gonna have to take a closer look at the Olympic Pistol competition First we got South Korean Kim Yeji. Who's a total badass. Then comes Turkish competitor Yusuf Dike\u00e7. Who casually goes out and wins the Silver with one hand in his pocket!\"\n\nMeanwhile, India's Manu Bhaker made history by becoming the first Indian (post-independence) to win two Olympic medals in a single edition of the Olympic games.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Turkish Shooter Breaks the Internet with His Unconventional Style after Winning Silver at Paris 2024 Olympics", "body": "Olympic Games fans have gone into meltdown on social media over a photo of Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec participating in the 10-meter air pistol mixed team event in Paris. The 51-year-old, along with his partner Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, won the silver medal, but it was Dikec's unconventional style of competition that has made his photo go viral.\n\nDikec gained widespread attention after a photo surfaced showing him competing in an unusually relaxed manner, without standard shooting gear, and with one hand in his pocket. At the Olympic Games, most shooters wear an ear protection and use specialized glasses that block vision in one eye, allowing them to keep it open.\n\nStar in His Own Right\n\nThese glasses often have tinted lenses to reduce glare. However, Dikec wasn't wearing any of the gear. He was wearing his own regular glasses and was also not having any ear protection. He looked casual with one hand in his pocket as he took aim.\n\n\"Turkey sent a 51-year-old dude with no specialized lenses, eye cover, or ear protection, and secured the silver medal,\" wrote one fan on X - to which billionaire Elon Musk responded, \"Nice.\"\n\n\"I know a trained assassin when I see one,\" joked another.\n\n\"Turkey Government: We have a different kind of job for you this week,\" wrote a third commentator.\n\n\"Did Turkey send a hitman to the Olympics?\" remarked yeat another person.\n\nDikec, competing in his fifth Olympic Games, and his partner narrowly missed out on the gold medal, ending with a final score of 16-14.\n\nThe viral photo follows the buzz around South Korean shooter Kim Ye-ji, who was celebrated as \"the coolest person ever\" during her event.\n\nThe 31-year-old pistol shooter won silver in the women's 10-meter air pistol event, finishing just behind her fellow countrywoman Oh Ye-jin.\n\nOlympic Shooters Go Viral\n\nKim's style was as impressive as her shooting precision. She was widely admired for her 'badass' look, sporting custom shooting glasses and a white baseball cap, while holding her daughter's stuffed toy elephant in her non-shooting hand.\n\nSince Kim won her first Olympic medal on Sunday, a video of her from the shooting World Cup in Baku this past May has gone viral on social media.\n\nThe footage captures Kim winning gold in Baku in the 25m pistol event and setting a new world record in the process.\n\nOne viewer commented on the viral video, saying: \"This is the coolest anyone has ever looked while breaking a world record.\"\n\n\"And she's nonchalant about it, oh she's the coldest main character out there,\" wrote another fan.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

The new-found fame was merely the result of his legendary aura. The 51-year-old, with hands in his pockets and no special gear, claimed the silver medal on Tuesday and the internet sleuths can't stop talking about it.\n\nDikec, accompanied by his duos partner Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, won the second place in the mixed team 10-meter air pistol event. A day later his photograph went insanely viral all over the internet because Dikec was without any specialized goggles or ear protection, common pieces of equipment that shooters tend to wear during competitions. Instead, the veteran was donning what seems to be regular prescription glasses and earplugs and was still able to defeat most of his competition.\n\nThe moment which captures Difec with hands in his pockets, taking his legendary pose for pistol shooting at Paris Olympics has drawn interest. Because arrayed against him was South Korean air pistol opponent Kim Yeji who almost opted for a film star-like gear up to make an appearance.\n\nReacting to the difference, a user joked, \"South Korea sent a fully-kitted out player for the Olympic shooting. Turkey sent a guy with no specialized lenses, eye cover or ear protection and got the silver medal.\" Another joined the bandwagon noting, \"I know a trained assassin when I see one.\"\n\nNotably, this was Yusuf Dikec's fifth Olympics Games but the first time he ever won a medal in the competition.

'I know a trained assassin when I see one,' joked another. 'Did Turkey send a hitman to the Olympics ?' posted another. A fourth wrote: 'Turkey Government: We have a different kind of job for you this week.'\n\nDikec is in his fifth Olympic Games, and he and his partner narrowly missed out on the gold medal with a final score of 16-14. The viral pic comes after South Korean Kim Ye-ji was dubbed 'the coolest person ever' during her shooting event.\n\nThe 31-year-old pistol shooter won a silver medal on Sunday in the women's 10 metre air pistol event when she finished just behind compatriot Oh Ye-jin. But it was Kim's style as much as her accuracy that really impressed the viewers.\n\nKim was widely described as looking 'badass' as she rocked a bespoke pair of shooting glasses and a white baseball cap, while carrying her daughter's stuffed toy elephant in her non-shooting hand. Since Kim won her first Olympic medal on Sunday, footage of her in action at May's shooting World Cup in Baku has gone viral via social media.\n\nThe video in question showed Kim (Pictured) winning gold in Baku in the 25m pistol competition, setting a new world record in the process.\n\nCommenting on the viral video, one viewer wrote: 'This is the coolest anyone has ever looked while breaking a world record'. Another replied: 'This is the coldest [expletive]. I'm obsessed' A third comment read: 'And she's nonchalant about it, oh she's the coldest main character out there'.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He was also seen casually shooting with a hand in pocket while competing in a sport that is considered to be a highly-tensed event.\n\nAccording to the International Shooting Sport Federation, the governing body of shooting events at the Olympics, Dikec is a member of the Turkish Armed Forces.\n\nThis is Dikec's fifth appearance at the Olympics following his debut in 2008 at Beijing.\n\nThe Indian pair of Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh had bagged the bronze in the 10-meter air pistol shooting mixed team event after defeating the Koreans 16-10 to earn the country its second medal at the quadrennial showpiece. Bhaker became the first Indian after independence to bag two medals in a single edition of the Games.\n\nMeanwhile Dikec's memes come a few days after South Korean air pistol competitor Kim Ye Ji, who won a silver in the women's 10-meter air pistol event, went viral for her \"movie star\" appearance at the Olympics along with precision in shooting.\n\nKim Ye Ji, born in 1992, won the second spot after narrowly edging out India's Manu Bhaker by just 0.1 point. Dressed in her black South Korean uniform, zipped up to the neck, with a baseball hat and wire-rimmed glasses, the 31-year-old looked like a stunner.

At the Paris 2024 Olympics, they missed the gold by a narrow margin, with a score of 16-1\n\nAll seems fine so far, and it wouldn't be significant news except for the fact that the 51-year-old had almost no equipment.\n\nWhat do we mean by equipment? In shooting, athletes typically have several extras to aid their performance, such as jackets that enhance body stability (while also reducing recoil), gloves, heavy noise-canceling headphones, and special glasses for better aiming by reducing distracting objects around them and blurring.\n\nIn contrast to others, Dikec simply wore a pair of regular earplugs, and his normal glasses, put his hand in his pocket to \"maximize\" his casual approach, and went for the medal. These were his third Olympic Games, having participated in Beijing (2008) and London (2012), but he had never won a medal at the world's top competition. However, he is not a newcomer, with several distinctions at European and world levels. His most recent medal before this one in France was also silver, again in mixed events, at the World Championships in Baku (Azerbaijan) a year earlier.\n\nNaturally, comparisons were made to South Korean Kim Ye-Ji, who had made a tremendous impression worldwide with her style and presence.\n\nOf course, there is also a... secret about Dikec. The 51-year-old has experience with firearms as he is an experienced shooter and an officer in the Turkish Gendarmerie.\n\nWatch the video:\n\nim Ye-Ji won silver in shooting and is preparing for...

media users worldwide, with one commenter saying he \"looks like he had an Olympic game after a morning coffee.\"\n\nOthers likened Dikec to action movie character John Wick, as well as video game characters Agent 47 from Hitman and Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption II.\n\nOther netizens also had humorous responses to the silver medalist's photo.\n\nSerbia reigned supreme in the event as

Shooter Yusuf Dikec's swag goes viral", "body": "Amidst the ongoing Olympic Games in Paris, Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec, 51, and his partner Sevval Ilayda Tarhan have stirred social media frenzy by clinching the silver medal in the 10-metre air pistol mixed team event. Dikec's unconventional approach to the competition has grabbed a lot of attention. Competing without the typical shooting gear and with one hand in his pocket, Dikec's relaxed demeanor has become a viral sensation.\n\nMost Olympic shooters use ear protection and specialized glasses that obscure vision in one eye, often equipped with tinted lenses to reduce glare. However, Dikec chose not to use these common aids, which has led to a series of humorous comments online. A circulating photo of Dikec during the event has sparked amusing reactions, highlighting his unconventional and seemingly nonchalant style.\n\n\"Turkey sent a 51-year-old dude with no specialized lenses, eye cover, or ear protection, and secured the silver medal,\" one fan wrote on social media platform X, catching the attention of billionaire Elon Musk, who responded, \"Nice.\"\n\n\"I know a trained assassin when I see one,\" joked another user. \"Did Turkey send a hitman to the Olympics?\" commented another netizen, playing into the intrigue surrounding Dikec's cool and composed approach.\n\nA fourth user added, \"Turkey Government: We have a different kind of job for you this week.\"\n\nComments comparing Dikec's performance to an assassin's cold precision have spread widely, adding a humorous edge to his achievement. Dikec's participation in his fifth Olympic Games and securing the silver medal alongside Tarhan in the 10-meter air pistol mixed team event is noteworthy, particularly given their close final score of 16-14, narrowly missing out on the gold medal.\n\nThe Turkish duo's impressive performance amidst the buzz surrounding Dikec's style has certainly caught the public's attention. While his relaxed demeanor and minimalist approach have generated laughs and admiration alike, their silver medal win remains an inspirational feat.\n\nThe photo of Dikec has triggered a wave of memes and posts across social media platforms, highlighting the unique and diverse nature of Olympic competitors and their varied approaches to sport.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Dike\u00e7", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yusuf Dike\u00e7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112190183,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-46488,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9781231", "eventUri": "eng-9781231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

In the viral pic, he is seen pointing his pistol towards the target without any shooting gear and with one hand in his pocket. His casual attitude has made him an internet sensation, where netizens are terming him as a 'hitman'.\n\nIndian businessman Anand Mahindra, who is also a regular social media user, couldn't stop himself from acknowledging the man and reshared his picture on his X account. Sharing Yusuf Dikec's picture, the business tycoon wrote, ''SWAG. This man just explained the meaning of the term to us.''\n\nPaparazzo Viral Bhayani too shared his picture on his Instagram account and wrote, ''the contrast between Turkish sir pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec's seriousness of the Olympic competition and relaxed, casual stance is quite amusing! The image of him taking aim with one hand in his pocket and wearing minimal gear is a great example of a lighthearted moment in an otherwise intense competition. It's wonderful to see people enjoying and sharing a humorous moment like this on social media.''\n\nThe viral pic of Yusuf Dikec triggered a wave of memes on social media, highlighting his style and approach to competing at a global sports event. Soon after Anand Mahindra shared his picture on his X handle, netizens started flooding the comment section. One user wrote, ''Sir..He purposely went for silver medal to avoid suspicion.''\n\n''This 51-year-old man won a silver medal without special glasses and instruments It's really amazing Wonderful, amazing and awesome This 'Turkey Man' has become a topic of discussion all over the world. His swag will inspire millions of youth.

However, his Olympic dream only materialised at the Paris Games, a 12 year wait that tested his patience and perseverance.\n\nHaving watched Dhoni's biopic multiple times, Kusale harbours ambitions of achieving similar heights in his sport.\n\nA podium finish in the 50m rifle three positions final would undoubtedly place him among India's sporting elite.\n\n'I don't follow anyone specific in the shooting world. Outside of that, I admire Dhoni for the person that he is. My sport requires me to be as calm and patient as he is on the field.

In fact, it added a touch of mystique to his already impressive career.\n\nPartnering with Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, Dikec secured a silver medal in the 10-meter air pistol mixed team event at the Paris Olympics.\n\nHis laid-back demeanour, characterised by a nonchalant stance with one hand in his pocket, contrasted sharply with the intense focus typically associated with the sport.\n\nDikec's victory has sparked a viral sensation, with social media abuzz about his unique style.

pistol shooting competition has become a hotbed of social media buzz, thanks to two remarkable Olympians who have captured the public's imagination not just with their marksmanship, but with their distinctive appearance.\n\nTurkish shooter Yusuf Dikec, has stunned audiences by securing a silver medal in the mixed team 10-metre air pistol event while competing with virtually no specialised equipment.\n\nIn a sport where athletes typically use specialised glasses and noise-cancelling earmuffs, the 51-year-old stood out by wearing only a pair of ordinary black-framed glasses and his white national team jersey.\n\nMost notably, he competed with his left hand casually tucked in his pocket, with many fans and Olympics-watchers dubbed him as an \"assassin\" on social media for his laid-back, yet highly effective approach.\n\nHis unconventional style has sparked widespread interest, with many fans drawing comparisons to the fictional hitman John Wick, known for his cool demeanour.\n\nDikec, alongside his partner Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, achieved an impressive score of 582 to claim their silver medal.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea's Kim Yeji, 31, has also become a viral sensation, for almost the same thing.\n\nIn this case, Kim, who also clinched silver in the women's 10m air pistol event with 241.3 points, has been praised for her \"futuristic\" look on the range.\n\nSporting a white cap and black jacket, her shooting stance -- leaning back with one hand on her hip and the other holding the pistol -- caused a stir online, as many drew comparisons to Trinity, an iconic character from \"The Matrix\" franchise.\n\nThe contrast between Dikec's minimalist, \"assassin-like\" appearance and Kim's sci-fi-inspired look has created a fascinating narrative at these Olympic Games.\n\nMany fans have noted the coincidental connection between the two shooters' pop culture comparisons, as both John Wick and The Matrix star Keanu Reeves.", "source": {"uri":

CrowdStrike claimed Delta would have to explain its own IT shortcomings in any litigation, and that it ignored CrowdStrike's offers of assistance.\n\nIn a letter from CrowdStrike's legal counsel to Delta's legal counsel on Sunday, the cybersecurity firm said it was \"highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed willful misconduct.\"\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz offered online assistance personally to Delta CEO Ed Bastian but received no response, the letter said, adding that Delta later told CrowdStrike no help was needed during the airline's nearly weeklong service outage that canceled thousands of flights.\n\nDelta's public litigation threat \"contributed to a misleading narrative that CrowdStrike is responsible for Delta's IT decisions and response to the outage,\" attorney Michael Carlinsky wrote in the letter, \"Should Delta pursue this path, Delta will have to explain to the public, its shareholders, and ultimately a jury why CrowdStrike took responsibility for its actions -- swiftly, transparently, and constructively -- while Delta did not.\"\n\nCrowdStrike's flawed software update caused widespread computer outages on July 19 at Delta and hundreds of other companies around the globe.\n\nBut last week, Bastian claimed CrowdStrike was nowhere to be found during the meltdown.\n\n\"They haven't offered us anything. Free consulting advice to help us,\" said the Delta CEO in an interview on CNBC.\n\n\"If you're going to have priority access to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you've got to test this stuff,\" Bastian said. \"You can't come into a mission critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug. It doesn't work.\"\n\nCrowdStrike's letter brought up criticisms other passengers had with Delta's meltdown in July. It said Delta would have to explain why other airlines restored operations faster and why it turned down CrowdStrike's onsite assistance. It also said Delta would have to explain \"resiliency capabilities of Delta's IT infrastructure.\"\n\nThe computer problems at Delta knocked its crucial crew tracking system offline for the better part of a week, making it impossible for the company to find pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its aircraft. While other airlines were quick to resume normal operations after the CrowdStrike outage, Delta was forced to cancel about 30% of its schedule over five days, leaving an estimated half-million passengers stranded. It took many days after that to re-book affected passengers on other flights and return their checked bags.\n\nThe cybersecurity company also said it was contractually capped at liabilities in the single millions.\n\nCrowdStrike said that while litigation would be unfortunate, it is willing to fight back.\n\nThe letter was addressed to high-profile attorney David Boies, who CNN reported had been hired by Delta to pursue compensation from CrowdStrike as well as Microsoft, whose Windows operating system on Delta's computers was disrupted by the software update.\n\n\"CrowdStrike will respond aggressively, if forced to do so, in order to protect its shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders,\" the letter said.\n\nDelta has yet to file the lawsuit. The airline did not have comment but directed inquiries to Bastian's interview on CNBC.\n\n\"We have no choice,\" Bastian previously told CNBC. \"We have to protect our shareholders, we have to protect our customers (and) our employees for the damage, not just the cost but the reputational damage.\"\n\nCNN's Chris Isidore contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramishah_maruf@cnn.com", "name": "Ramishah Maruf", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kurtz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Kurtz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Boies", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Boies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IT infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2164495862.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790488", "eventUri": "eng-9790488", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1418, "textEnd": 1425}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

You can't come into a mission critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug,\"\n\nOn the matter of seeking damages from the cybersecurity firm, Bastian said Delta doesn't have much choice.\n\nThe airline has not filed a lawsuit against CrowdStrike or Microsoft at the time of writing, but reporting from CNN stated Delta has hired the law firm of leading attorney David Boies to seek compensation from the two companies.\n\nIn a letter responding to the threats of potential legal action from Delta, CrowdStrike reiterated an apology to the airline's employees and customers while rejecting accusations of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.\n\nThe letter directly addressed Bastian's claim that the firm had not carried out necessary testing before rolling out updates.\n\n\"Your suggestion that CrowdStrike failed to do testing and validation is contradicted by the very information on which you rely from CrowdStrike's Preliminary Post Incident Review.\"\n\nCrowdStrike's rebuttal noted Delta's accusations have created a 'misleading narrative' that it was responsible for the airline's IT decisions and response to the outage.\n\nIt raised a series of questions around Delta's response, noting CrowdStrike took responsibility for its actions immediately, while Delta has yet to explain why its competitors were able to restore operations faster. The cybersecurity firm also questioned why Delta turned down onsite assistance from CrowdStrike professionals, who it noted helped many other customers swiftly restore operations.\n\nSpeaking to ITPro, a spokesperson for CrowdStrike said the 'public posturing' from Delta was not constructive, and hoped the two firms could agree to find a resolution.\n\n\"The letter speaks for itself.

The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.\n\nWhat CrowdStrike said in its letter\n\nAs per the report, CrowdStrike reiterated its apology to the airline operator. However, in a letter from an external lawyer, the company said that it is \"highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed misconduct.\"\n\nThe letter stated that \"any liability by CrowdStrike is contractually capped at an amount in the single-digit millions.\"\n\n\"Additionally, CrowdStrike's CEO personally reached out to Delta's CEO to offer onsite assistance, but received no response,\" the letter added.\n\nThe CrowdStrike letter further added that if Delta files suit, it will need to answer \"why Delta's competitors, facing similar challenges, all restored operations much faster\" and \"why Delta turned down free onsite help from CrowdStrike professionals who assisted many other customers to restore operations much more quickly than Delta.\"\n\nThe Reuters report quotes a CrowdStrike spokesperson who said \"public posturing about potentially bringing a meritless lawsuit against CrowdStrike as a long-time partner is not constructive to any party.

The airline has alerted the cyber security company that it plans to seek damages for the disruptions and hired litigation firm Boies Schiller Flexner.\n\nCrowdStrike addressed Sunday's letter to the law firm, whose chair David Boies has previously represented the US government in its antitrust case against Microsoft and Harvey Weinstein, among other prominent clients.\n\nMicrosoft has estimated that about 8.5mn Windows devices were hit by the faulty update, which stranded airline passengers, interrupted hospital appointments and took broadcasters off air around the world. CrowdStrike said last week that 99 per cent of Windows devices running the affected Falcon software were now back online.\n\nMajor US airlines Delta, United and American briefly grounded their aircraft on the morning of July 19. But while United and American were able to restore their operations over the weekend, Delta's flight disruptions continued well into the following week.\n\nThe Atlanta-based carrier in the end cancelled more than 6,000 flights, triggering an investigation from the US Department of Transportation amid claims of poor customer service during the operational chaos.\n\nCrowdStrike's lawyer Michael Carlinsky, co-managing partner of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, wrote that, if it pursues legal action, Delta Air Lines would have to explain why its competitors were able to restore their operations much faster.\n\nHe added: \"Should Delta pursue this path, Delta will have to explain to the public, its shareholders, and ultimately a jury why CrowdStrike took responsibility for its actions -- swiftly, transparently and constructively -- while Delta did not.\"\n\nCrowdStrike also claimed that Delta's leadership had ignored and rejected offers for help: \"CrowdStrike's CEO personally reached out to Delta's CEO to offer onsite assistance, but received no response. CrowdStrike followed up with Delta on the offer for onsite support and was told that the onsite resources were not needed.\"\n\nDelta chief executive Ed Bastian said last week that CrowdStrike had not \"offered anything\" to make up for the disruption at the airline. \"Free consulting advice to help us -- that's the extent of it,\" he told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Bastian has said that the disruption would cost Delta $500mn, CrowdStrike insisted that \"any liability by CrowdStrike is contractually capped at an amount in the single-digit millions\".\n\nA spokesperson for CrowdStrike accused Delta of \"public posturing about potentially bringing a meritless lawsuit against CrowdStrike\" and said it hoped the airline would \"agree to work cooperatively to find a resolution\".",

Delta didn't comment on the letter on Sunday night. In a separate statement, CrowdStrike said it hopes \"Delta will agree to work cooperatively to find a resolution.\"\n\n\"We did everything we could to take care of our customers over that time frame,\" Bastian said in Wednesday's \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"If you're going to be having access, priority access, to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you've got to test this stuff.

The airline has alerted CrowdStrike and Microsoft that it is planning to pursue legal claims to recover its losses, and has hired litigation firm Boies Schiller Flexner to assist, according to a memo Bastian sent to Delta employees last week.\n\nCrowdStrike said Sunday that its liability is contractually capped at an amount in the \"single-digit millions.\" The company has said a bug in a quality-control tool that it uses to check system updates for mistakes allowed a critical flaw to be pushed to millions of machines running Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe cybersecurity company reiterated its apology to Delta for the initial disruption and said it had offered on-site assistance to Delta but was told it wasn't needed.

Delta continued to struggle well into the following week -- something CrowdStrike highlighted in its letter. The airline canceled more than 5,000 mainline flights over several days, far more than rivals.

It was caused by an error in a binary file at the Windows kernel level, leading Microsoft to debate whether the \"tradeoff\" of kernel-level access is worth the risk. Only Windows machines using CrowdStrike were impacted, but the sheer number of crashed systems that had to be fixed manually resulted in thousands of delayed flights, shuttered government offices, delayed packages, and made it difficult for hospitals to operate normally around the world.\n\nWhile some airlines fared better in their recovery efforts, Delta struggled to resolve its issues and cancelled over 5,000 flights, more than any other impacted airline.

It then went on to remind Boies, known for his work as special counsel during the 1990s US antitrust trial against Microsoft, that it had been proactive in reaching out to Delta, offering support to the airline \"within hours\" of the incident unfolding.\n\n\"Delta's public threat of litigation distracts from this work and has contributed to a misleading narrative that CrowdStrike is responsible for Delta's IT decisions and response to the outage,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"Should Delta pursue this path, Delta will have to explain to the public, its shareholders, and ultimately a jury why CrowdStrike took responsibility for its actions - swiftly, transparently, and constructively - while Delta did not.\"\n\nCrowdStrike's lawyer, Michael B. Carlinsky, then poked the bear further. He said that among other things, in this hypothetical trial Delta would also need to explain why it took so much longer than competitors to recover from the same issue, why it refused the free on-site help CrowdStrike offered - the support that led to faster recovery times than Delta's, and the operational resiliency of its IT infrastructure.\n\nBefore demanding a swathe of data to be preserved by Delta should the \"unfortunate\" litigation move forward, Carlinsky said CrowdStrike would \"respond aggressively\" to protect its customers, employees, and shareholders.\n\n\"CrowdStrike's focus remains on its customers, including Delta,\" the letter went on to say. \"CrowdStrike hopes Delta reconsiders its approach and agrees to work cooperatively with CrowdStrike going forward, as the two sides historically have done.\"\n\nThe Register contacted Delta for input but it did not immediately respond.\n\nA Crowdstrike spokesperson told The Register: \"The letter speaks for itself. We have expressed our regret and apologies to all of our customers for this incident and the disruption that resulted. Public posturing about potentially bringing a meritless lawsuit against CrowdStrike as a long-time partner is not constructive to any party. We hope that Delta will agree to work cooperatively to find a resolution.\"\n\nPer our reporting last week of Delta's plans to explore litigation, the airline was also looking into potentially bringing legal action against Microsoft too as systems running on its Windows OS were exclusively affected by the incident.\n\nIt made the appointment of David Boies - named partner at the New York firm Boies Schiller Flexner - even more compelling, given the lawyer's history in taking on Microsoft and winning.\n\nBoies was special trial counsel in the Department of Justice's 1998 antitrust case against Microsoft which two years later resulted in Microsoft being found guilty on most charges related to bundling Internet Explorer with Windows, before settling on appeals in 2001.\n\nHe has also represented various other Microsoft opponents too, as well as numerous high-profile clients from the tech sphere and beyond.\n\nThe vast majority of CrowdStrike customers are now back online and fully recovered, although the global mega outage was still being fingered for lingering issues as recently as last week.\n\nSome users took longer to recover than others because booting into safe mode or trying to work through some of the other early recovery options on a Windows device required inputting their Bitlocker recovery key. BitLocker is Microsoft's encryption tool, which makes a Windows device's storage inaccessible without the key.\n\nAs for Crowdstrike, the security shop is now battling other issues, namely its share price the value of which continues to fall according to premarket figures today.\n\nShares are trading at $217.89 which is a hefty tumble compared to the price exactly a month ago - $389.68.\n\nThis is understandably not very good news for shareholders, some of whom are assembling to sue the company over its approach to rolling out updates.\n\nThe Plymouth County Retirement Association pension fund brought federal legal action against CrowdStrike last week on behalf of savers who held shares in the company between 29 November, 2023, and 29 July this year.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges CrowdStrike had not properly deployed canary testing before a phased rollout of updates as a means of preventing similar IT calamities in the future, and alleges this contributed directly led to the global outages in July.\n\n\"Since the CrowdStrike outage, publicly revealed evidence indicates that CrowdStrike was taking insufficient precautions regarding such updates,\" the lawsuit [PDF] alleges.\n\n\"For instance, CrowdStrike has promised to take remedial measures to ensure that such a crash does not happen again, including implementing a so-called canary deployment of such updates, meaning a progressive rollout that starts with a subset of users.\n\n\"This indicates CrowdStrike was not taking such measures prior to the CrowdStrike outage.\"\n\nResponding to the development, CrowdStrike told us: \"We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company.\" \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"},

CrowdStrike said on Sunday that its chief executive officer, George Kurtz, tried to connect with his counterpart at the airline, Delta CEO Ed Bastian.\n\n\"CrowdStrike's CEO personally reached out to Delta's CEO to offer onsite assistance, but received no response,\" according to the letter, which was signed by Michael Carlinsky, co-managing partner of law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.\n\nIn a separate e-mailed statement, CrowdStrike said that it hopes Delta will \"agree to work cooperatively to find a resolution\".\n\nDelta was not immediately available for comment outside of regular US business hours.\n\nThe Atlanta, Georgia-based carrier was by far the worst hit airline as it struggled to normalise flight operations several days after the outage. Delta said it took a US$500 million charge after cancelling more than 5,500 flights in the several days that followed the initial CrowdStrike outage.\n\nSpirit Airlines said the outage that occurred in mid-July would contribute to a US$7.2 million negative hit to third-quarter operating income. Meanwhile, Tony Fernandes, the co-founder of one of South-east Asia's largest low-cost carriers, AirAsia, has also demanded compensation for the disruption.

Previously, the carrier threatened to take action against the cybersecurity firm in relation to its update that caused a massive IT outage globally. While airlines in the US resotred operations relatively quickly, Delta Air Lines had struggled to do so for almost a week.\n\nCrowdStrike, the cybersecurity solutions provider whose update had resulted in thousands of flights being canceled on a weekend in mid-July, has fired back at Delta Air Lines, with the company's counsel alleging that the carrier and its chief executive had ignored offers for help as the airline continued canceling flights for several days.\n\nIgnoring offers for help\n\nThe letter, dated August 4, was in response to Delta Air Lines' threats of litigation against CrowdStrike related to the IT meltdown that its update to the Falcon platform had caused on July 19, which affected flights for the next several days.\n\nHowever, Delta Air Lines had struggled to restore its operations for almost a week, despite airlines in the United States restoring operations within days.\n\nPhoto: Spyros Vasileiou | Shutterstock\n\nNevertheless, David Boies, representing CrowdStrike, stated in the letter that the cybersecurity company was very disappointed by the suggestions that it acted inappropriately and rejected allegations that it was grossly negligent or willfully engaged in malpractice in relation to the Falcon platform update.\n\n\"Your suggestion that CrowdStrike failed to do testing and validation is contradicted by the very information on which you rely from CrowdStrike's Preliminary Post Incident Review.\"\n\nBoies continued that the company worked tirelessly to help customers restore impacted systems, and within hours, CrowdStrike reached out to Delta Air Lines, offering assistance. Furthermore, the firm's chief executive officer (CEO) reached out to the CEO of the airline \"but received no response.\"\n\n\"CrowdStrike followed up with Delta on the offer for onsite support and was told that the onsite resources were not needed.\"\n\nRelated Delta Air Lines Enlists High-Profile Lawyer Against CrowdStrike\n\nThe airline is said to have suffered losses ranging from $350-500 million.\n\n14 Shifting responsibility\n\nBoies alleged that Delta Air Lines' threats of litigation have distracted from the work that CrowdStrike has been doing and have contributed to a false narrative that the cybersecurity company was responsible for the carrier's IT decisions and the response to the outage.\n\nShould the airline pursue legal action, Delta Air Lines will have to explain itself why CrowdStrike claimed responsibility for its actions, while the airline did not.\n\nAffirming his argument, the counsel questioned why the carrier's competitors in the US had managed to restore operations much faster, why Delta Air Lines declined onsite help from CrowdStrike, and that any contractual liabilities were capped at an amount in the single-digit millions.\n\nPhoto: Trong Nguyen | Shutterstock\n\nFurthermore, Boies said that the carrier would have to explain every action or the failure to act by Delta Air Lines and/or its third-party providers related to the IT outage and the design and resilience of the airline's IT systems.\n\nThe counsel noted that in light of threats of litigation, CrowdStrike was forced to demand Delta Air Lines keep all documents, records, and communications of any kind that were in the control of the airline, its employees, and its executives.\n\n\"As I am sure you can appreciate, while litigation would be unfortunate, CrowdStrike will respond aggressively, if forced to do so, in order to protect its shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.\"\n\nRelated WOW: 6,855 Flights Were Canceled On Friday Following Global IT Outage\n\nAir France-KLM had to downsize operations.\n\n6 Losing $500 million\n\nMeanwhile, Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, told CNBC that the outage will cost the airline around $500 million, which included lost revenue, compensations, and accommodations that the carrier had to provide to its passengers.\n\nThe US Department Of Transportation reminded airlines of their obligations to refund passengers according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act, enacted in May.\n\nPhoto: agsaz | Shutterstock\n\nIn its preliminary post-incident review, CrowdStrike said that on July 19, the company released a regular update that resulted in a Windows system crash, with Mac and Linux hosts being unaffected by the release.\n\n\"On July 19, 2024, two additional IPC Template Instances were deployed. Due to a bug in the Content Validator, one of the two Template Instances passed validation despite containing problematic content data.\"\n\nWhile airlines in the United States had canceled 16,344 flights between July 19 and July 21, Delta Air Lines axed over 7,000 flights from July 19 to July 24, according to data that Flightradar24 provided to Simple Flying.\n\nRelated USDOT Reminds Airlines Of Refund Obligations After Crowdstrike Global IT Fail\n\nPete Buttigieg's letter was a warning to airline CEOs that they have to respect the rules enacted with the FAA Reauthorization Act.\n\n3", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Bastian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ed Bastian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter-process communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/delta-air-lines-boeing-767-300-departing-shutterstock_1794099877.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790488", "eventUri": "eng-9790488", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "dateEnd": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 4853, "textEnd": 4872}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "dateEnd": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 4919, "textEnd": 4937}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 789, "textEnd": 797}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 957, "textEnd": 964, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 4575, "textEnd": 4582}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

As I was watching CNBC's coverage of the Paris Olympics and related financial stories this past week, one segment caught my eye. Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, was being interviewed by the \"Squawk Box\" team. He said the recent CrowdStrike/Microsoft outage cost Delta $500 million in five days -- not to mention the ire of so many impacted customers.\n\n\"It was terrible. It was terrible,\" said Bastian. \"My apologies again to all of our customers.\"\n\nWhen asked if this incident will make Delta rethink how all of their global systems are interconnected, he responded, \"Absolutely!\"\n\nHe described how heavy Delta's investment is with both CrowdStrike and Microsoft, and bemoaned the reality that they are the top two competitors on cyber. \"They don't necessarily partner at the same level that we need them to. This is a call to the Big Tech industry to be responsible.\"\n\nYou can see that entire interview here:\n\nAnd in a related article from CNBC, we learned that the airline has hired David Boies to seek damages against the two companies. That article begins this way:\n\n\"Delta Air Lines has hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike and Microsoft following an outage this month that caused millions of computers to crash, leading to thousands of flight cancellations.\n\n\"CrowdStrike shares fell as much as 5 percent in extended trading on Monday after CNBC's Phil Lebeau reported on Delta's hiring of Boies, chairman of Boies Schiller Flexner. Microsoft was little changed.\n\n\"On July 19, a software update from CrowdStrike led to a historic outage of Microsoft systems, knocking numerous industries offline. Airlines were particularly hard hit, and the Department of Transportation said last week that it's investigating Delta, which suffered widespread flight disruptions and service failures.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a lawsuit by shareholders was filed this past week, according to Reuters.\n\n\"CrowdStrike has been sued by shareholders who said the cybersecurity company defrauded them by concealing how its inadequate software testing could cause the July 19 global outage that crashed more than 8 million computers.\n\n\"In a proposed class action filed on Tuesday night in the Austin, Texas, federal court, shareholders said they learned that CrowdStrike's assurances about its technology were materially false and misleading when a flawed software update disrupted airlines, banks, hospitals and emergency lines around the world.\n\n\"They said CrowdStrike's share price fell 32 percent over the next 12 days, wiping out $25 billion of market value, as the outage's effects became known. ...\"\n\nIt is unknown at this time if governments and/or other companies plan to take legal action as a result of the global incident, but it seems likely.\n\nNevertheless, most enterprise software contracts have pretty well-defined terms and conditions and language around indemnity and service-level agreements that tend to make it clear they are not responsible for business/operating losses outside of their control. In some cases, losses are capped by the value of the contract or some multiple of the contract value.\n\nAccording to MSSPAlert last week, \"Analytics and insurance provider Parametrix calculated the financial impact of last week's outage at $5.4 billion in losses for Fortune 500 companies, excluding Microsoft Corp. (MSFT).\n\n\"The cybersecurity insurance policies of CrowdStrike's Fortune 500 customers will likely cover no more than 10 percent to 20 percent of those losses, Parametrix said in its report Wednesday. The estimated insured losses on cyber insurance policies ranges from $540 million to $1.08 billion.\"\n\nAccording to Morningstar, \"CrowdStrike is likely shielded from billions in customer losses caused by its outage.\"\n\n\"The outage is believed to have caused $5.4 billion in losses for big enterprises -- but various factors help insulate the cybersecurity company.\n\n\"Despite having caused one of the largest global technology meltdowns ever, resulting in billions of dollars in losses for its customers, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. itself should largely be shielded from direct financial impacts.\n\n\"That's due in part to the software industry's licensing structure, through which standard software licenses limit the liability of the software developer, and because of insurance held [by] both CrowdStrike (CRWD) and its customers.\"\n\nAnother fascinating trend to watch, according to Politico, is an effort by many lawmakers to limit the liability of hospitals and other health-care organizations following a cyber attack.\n\n\"Tennessee in May became the fourth state to limit organizations' liability in exchange for adopting cyber defenses, following Utah, Connecticut and Ohio.\n\n\"The spate of legislation pits large medical systems against trial lawyers and the affected patients they represent. It comes amid a scourge of cyber attacks that have threatened patient safety and cost the health-care system billions of dollars.\n\n\"As hacks have become more prevalent and bad actors have grown more sophisticated, many lawmakers have sought to protect health-care providers, arguing they can't reasonably be held responsible for every manner of attack headed their way.\n\n\"'What happens is they get hacked, and then by law they have to report there is a breach, and then you have these class-action suits pop up,' said Florida state Rep. Mike Giallombardo, a Republican who helped pass a bill limiting liability and owns a cybersecurity firm. 'The victim is being sued for tens of millions of dollars for so-called negligence when the fact is they weren't negligent. Nobody's immune from this. ...'\"\n\nCRC Group offered this perspective on cyber insurance impacts after the CrowdStrike and Microsoft outage effects:\n\n\"The CrowdStrike outage has sent shockwaves through the cybersecurity and insurance industries, highlighting the critical vulnerabilities even leading cybersecurity firms face as well as the significant impact of single points of failure. This unprecedented event disrupted services for thousands of businesses, revealing the potential for widespread operational paralysis. As the dust begins to settle, insurance professionals are left to assess the implications of such a significant failure. Some suggest the insurance coverages most affected include business interruption, contingent business interruption, and network restoration within cyber coverage. In addition, smaller lines such as event cancellation, travel insurance, and technology errors and omissions will also be impacted. There is also potential for Directors & Officers (D&O) insurance implications. ...\n\n\"It's anticipated that Microsoft and CrowdStrike clients will file claims for business interruption losses as a result of their outages. The application of coverage will be dependent on the waiting period within clients' cyber policies as well as the coverage trigger negotiated within the wording (i.e., security failure vs. systems failure).\n\n\"Similarly, clients of firms that use Microsoft and CrowdStrike could also file claims for dependent business interruption losses as a result of their outages, and coverage will be dependent on the same criteria -- the cyber policy waiting period and the coverage trigger negotiated within the wording (i.e., security failure vs. systems failure). ...\"\n\nLast week in my blog covering some initial lessons learned from this incident, I highlighted what my friend Michael McLaughlin had to say on LinkedIn: \"Does a global cyber outage qualify as a 'material cybersecurity incident'? This is the question hundreds of companies are grappling with this week. Under the SEC cyber rule, public companies are required to promptly disclose material cybersecurity incidents under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K. If the company is unsure whether the incident is material, the SEC released guidance that those incidents should be reported under Item 8.01. ... But what is a 'material cybersecurity incident'? What does this mean for CrowdStrike's public customers impacted by this event? Other companies should consider a range of factors when assessing whether this incident materially impacted them, such as: -Reputational harm -Remediation costs -Legal risks -Lost revenues -Insurance. Importantly, these should also be placed in the context of a global cyber outage -- e.g., what is the reputational damage to single company amongst thousands impacted?\"\n\nAnother interesting view comes from Tim Wessels:\n\n\"This will be unique to each company. Yes, Microsoft authorized (WHQL) the use of the Falcon kernel mode driver, but Microsoft does not authorize the Falcon update file or pseudo-code that is likely delivered multiple times a day and run by the Falcon kernel mode driver. The Falcon kernel mode driver 'choked' on an update file filled with zeros and borked the Windows kernel, which caused the Windows kernel to 'blue screen' to save itself from any additional damage.\n\n\"Was CrowdStrike just lucky that this never happened before? It should have employed checks before running the update. One was when the update was ready to be pushed out from CrowdStrike, and the Falcon kernel mode driver should have performed a second check before running the update. This strikes me as negligent behavior by CrowdStrike to assume that its Falcon update file would always arrive in the correct format. I think CrowdStrike will likely find itself on the receiving end of a class-action lawsuit for negligence, resulting in huge customer damage.\"\n\nThere remain many unanswered questions due to this incident surrounding liability, cyber insurance impacts, future changes to terms and conditions in contracts, and much more. No doubt, this will take years to resolve in the courts and C-suite conversations around the world.\n\nNevertheless, this incident also highlights many other areas that the cyber industry has discussed, but most organizations never fully addressed.\n\nPut another way, this may be as close as we have ever been to a \"Cyber 9/11\" or a \"Cyber Pearl Harbor\" -- if you factor in the global domino effects of this outage and overall impacts. These incident discussions are no longer just philosophical or scenarios for tabletop exercises. Those who have been saying (even seriously discussing) that \"a global Internet or international systems outage\" could happen are not just fearmongering or flat out wrong.\n\nAnd make no mistake, there are many who have been saying this for years. I have heard the \"it won't happen to me\" storyline from people all over the world as I gave presentations on true ransomware stories and leadership action plans.\n\nBottom line, we need to be better prepared. We must have more redundancy. Better understanding our third-party risk and the partners that we rely on is no longer low on the priority list. Improving contract wording needs attention now. All over the world, organizations are updating cyber insurance policy provisions, and refocusing on the next time a Cyber Mayday and the Day After comes -- whatever the cause.", "source": {"uri":

On July 18, Windows PC systems started crashing and it later emerged that the probable root cause was a botched update issued by cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. The fallout from the outage was massive as banks, hospitals, news outlets, restaurants, and several other businesses across the world were impacted.\n\nHowever, airlines and airports saw the most disruption in services with flights getting either delayed or cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded.\n\nWhat did Delta's CEO say?\n\nIn the days following the outage, more than 5,000 flights were reportedly cancelled by the carrier. The downtime cost the company about $500 million as it had to manually reset 40,000 servers, Bastian said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nFurthermore, Delta Airlines is being probed by the US Transportation Department which is looking into why the carrier took longer than other airlines to resume operations after the outage.\n\nCriticising Microsoft and Crowdstrike, Bastian said, \"When was the last time you heard of a big outage at Apple?\" However, it must be noted that Apple's services such as iCloud have suffered disruptions in the past. He also called the Delta staff's efforts to get systems running again as \"nothing short of heroic\" and offered each employee two free flight tickets.\n\nHow has Crowdstrike responded to Delta?\n\nIn its apology to Delta Airlines, Crowdstrike said that it was \"highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed misconduct.\"\n\n\"Any liability by CrowdStrike is contractually capped at an amount in the single-digit millions,\" the company was quoted as saying, adding that it had offered the carrier assistance within hours of the incident.\n\n\"Additionally, CrowdStrike's CEO personally reached out to Delta's CEO to offer onsite assistance, but received no response,\" the letter reportedly said.\n\n\"Public posturing about potentially bringing a meritless lawsuit against CrowdStrike as a long-time partner is not constructive to any party.

It comes after a rough week for global markets.\n\nThat has reignited criticisms that the Fed is moving too slowly to cut rates as economic conditions look shakier.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nGoldman Sachs economists this weekend raised the odds of a U.S. recession in the next year to 25 percent from 15 percent; they cautioned that such a risk was \"limited.\"\n\nBut the Goldman note -- along with recent disappointing earnings results, and lackluster economic reports including Friday's jobs report -- have compounded global fears that the U.S. is headed for a hard landing. All this has stoked speculation that the Fed will need to take bold action, such as a prodigious half-percentage point cut next month or an exceedingly rare emergency cut within the next week.\n\nCriticisms of the Fed are getting louder, especially from the I-told-you-so crowd. \"The Federal Reserve has been late in cutting rates, but that has been true for some time,\" Paul Donovan, a UBS economist, wrote in a client note on Monday. \"The policy error is making things worse for lower income households.\"\n\nCompanies have been warning for some time that lower-income consumers are pulling back, muddying their profit outlooks. \"The tone for companies on earnings calls will be key to watch in the coming weeks,\" Lori Calvasina, the head of global equity research at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note on Sunday.\n\nOthers say the worst fears are overblown. Volatility is common during bull market rallies, analysts cautioned. It's worth noting that the U.S. economy is still growing, and while Friday's unemployment data was weaker than expected, it was \"not a disaster scenario,\" Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies, wrote on Monday.\n\nWhat to watch this week: More data -- including jobless claims on Thursday -- and a flurry of corporate earnings reports could shed more light on how different parts of the U.S. economy are performing.\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway halves its stake in Apple. The conglomerate disclosed that it had sold about 390 million shares in the iPhone maker in the second quarter, as it continued to pare its exposure to the tech giant. (That still leaves Buffett with about 400 million shares in Apple, worth about $84.2 billion as of June 30.) The second quarter was the seventh straight of Berkshire selling more stocks than it bought.\n\nMars is said to weigh a potential deal for the maker of Cheez-Its. The snack giant is considering a takeover of Kellanova, the W.K. Kellogg spinoff that also produces Pringles chips and Eggo waffles, according to Reuters. It would be one of the biggest transactions in the packaged-foods sector -- Kellanova's market value as of Friday was $21.6 billion -- but could face antitrust scrutiny.\n\nElon Musk revives his legal fight with OpenAI. In a complaint filed on Monday in a federal district court in California, the billionaire again accused the start-up of fraud and breach of contract by prioritizing profits over safety, saying the \"deceit is of Shakespearean proportions.\" The lawsuit comes weeks after Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, withdrew a similar lawsuit against the start-up.\n\nHurricane Debby begins to batter the Southeast. It made landfall as a Category 1 storm on Monday in Florida. That's weaker than last year's Hurricane Idalia, which hit the same coast, but forecasters warned that Debby appeared to be a slower-moving storm that could bring \"potentially historic\" rainfall to areas including Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C. this week.\n\nThe legal saber rattling between the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and Delta Air Lines over last month's global I.T. outage just ratcheted up a notch.\n\nIn a letter sent to Delta last night that DealBook has reviewed, CrowdStrike's lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan pushed back against claims that it was responsible for the airline's canceling hundreds of flights. The blame for Delta's woes lies with the airline alone, the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe letter was in response to Delta lawyering up, hiring David Boies, a prominent litigator, and saying that it would seek damages over the outage, which it said cost it $500 million. Shares in both companies have plunged since the July 19 outage, with CrowdStrike down more than 35 percent.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- whose department is investigating Delta over the outage -- provided preliminary observations about what went wrong: \"Their systems seem to have been more dependent on pieces of software that were affected by CrowdStrike,\" he said, \"and we're told also that their crew scheduling system for positioning people basically got overloaded.\"\n\nCrowdStrike questioned why Delta suffered more than its rivals. The security company cited Delta's \"I.T. decisions and response to the outage\" and noted that the airline turned down \"free onsite help from CrowdStrike professionals.\"\n\nOther carriers, including American and United, rebounded faster from the outage. Aviation experts told The Times that Delta leaned more heavily on cancellations than delays and had trouble getting operations back to normal.\n\nCrowdStrike implied that its liability was limited. While Delta's C.E.O., Ed Bastian, told CNBC that the $500 million estimate factored in lost revenue and \"tens of millions of dollars per day in compensation and hotels,\" the software company's lawyers countered that \"any liability by CrowdStrike is contractually capped at an amount in the single-digit millions.\"\n\nCrowdStrike's lawyers added: \"Should Delta pursue this path, Delta will have to explain to the public, its shareholders and ultimately a jury why CrowdStrike took responsibility for its actions -- swiftly, transparently and constructively -- while Delta did not.\"\n\nAsked for a comment, a representative for Delta referred DealBook to Bastian's CNBC interview.\n\nAs Vice President Kamala Harris is poised to assume the mantle of Democratic standard-bearer for November, many in the party are still assessing where she lands on key issues.\n\nOne figure who is providing reassurance to party moderates, especially business leaders, is one of their own: Tony West, a veteran of the Obama administration who is Uber's chief legal officer -- and Harris's brother-in-law.\n\nWest is officially an unpaid adviser to Harris, The Times's Kate Kelly, Noam Scheiber and Kenneth Vogel report. He has already made his mark, helping her reach out to would-be supporters once President Biden dropped out. He also recommended bringing in Eric Holder, the former attorney general, to help vet potential running mates.\n\nWest brings a wealth of experience in government and business. He served as the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, helping lead settlements with the financial industry after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nAfter leaving government, he oversaw legal operations at PepsiCo, then joined Uber, where he was brought in to clean up the ride-hailing company's legal mess before its I.P.O. \"I've had conversations with Tony and people on their team, and I find them very smart, very open to all business ideas,\" Mark Cuban told The Times.\n\nProgressive Democrats worry West may move Harris too far to the center. Critics of his work on the financial settlements say that banks were spared bigger penalties, and that no prominent executives were prosecuted. And labor advocates attacked his role in Uber's fight against classifying drivers as employees.\n\nThat said, West has said he would stay at Uber after the election.\n\nIt's another sign of the Democratic battle over how Harris might govern, as those on the left square off against donors and other moderates. That's also playing out in the veepstakes, as liberals and union officials take aim at two potential running mates, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\nThe Times notes that most major donors would be fine with any of the leading candidates, who also include Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\n-- Donald Trump, at a campaign rally in Georgia over the weekend, referring to Elon Musk's backing for his presidential run. Trump later said that he supported E.V.s as a part of a broader auto industry.\n\nLVMH is all over the Paris Olympics, and luxury brands have embraced athletes in their endorsement deals. That hasn't necessarily translated into higher sales in the host city's stores.\n\nThat said, Both Moncler and Herm\u00e8s delivered relatively upbeat sales outlooks. And brands said they expected a boost in traffic at other European stores as tourists reroute their shopping sprees around the Games.\n\nWe'd like your feedback!

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said last week that the department would also examine Delta's customer service, including \"unacceptable\" lines for assistance and reports that unaccompanied minors were stranded at airports.\n\nOn July 25, Buttigieg told FOX 5's Tyler Fingert that the agency had received more than 3,000 complaints from Delta passengers.\n\n\"When there is a disruption, you need to be able to get a hold of a customer service agent who can help you, someone who can make sure you get the vouchers for meals, hotels, rebooking, that kind of thing, and somebody who can get you on your way,\" Secretary Buttigieg said. \"So, when we hear these reports of somebody having to wait in line for 8 hours to speak to somebody on the phone, people sleeping on the floor in airports because they weren't able to get accommodated or taken care of, that's a major concern and that's going to be a big focus of our investigation.\"\n\nSix days after the original outage, Delta was able to resume operations.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 Atlanta"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Boies", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Boies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Bastian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ed Bastian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Transportation_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Transportation Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Consolidators", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Consolidators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5atlanta.com/www.fox5atlanta.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1280/720/P-AIRPORT-ISSUES-_-OLYMPICS-10P_00.00.50.02.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790488", "eventUri": "eng-9790488", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1875, "textEnd": 1882}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Credit: EconoTimes\n\nDelta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian offered employees complimentary travel passes following significant disruptions caused by a botched CrowdStrike software update, which stranded thousands of customers and staff.\n\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian Grants Free Travel Passes to Employees Affected by Major Software Outages\n\nOn August 2, Delta Air Lines EO Ed Bastian provided employees with two complimentary travel permits as a gesture of appreciation to those impacted by the significant disruptions that occurred last month due to a botched CrowdStrike software update. According to CNBC, this update left thousands of customers and personnel stranded.\n\nDelta faced more significant challenges than its competitors in recovering from the outages that shut down thousands of Windows devices worldwide, affecting industries ranging from banking to health care.\n\nAccording to FlightAware, the carrier canceled over 5,000 flights between July 19 and July 24, more than in 2019. According to Bastian, the incident resulted in a loss of approximately $500 million for the company earlier this week. This amount is equivalent to approximately 40% of Delta's second-quarter profit. The cancellations and disruptions were attributed to a crew-tracking platform, according to the airline.\n\nDelta informed CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on July 31 that it was required to reconfigure 40,000 servers manually.\n\nBastian stated in his August 2 note that CNBC viewed the disruption as a \"humbling moment for our company. \"I know it's been tough, and I'm deeply sorry for what you have endured. An operational disruption of this length and magnitude is simply unacceptable -- you and our customers deserve better.\"\n\nDelta CEO Lauds 'Heroic' Efforts of Flight Attendants Amid Major Disruptions, Offers Travel Passes\n\nAccording to an additional Delta staff memo issued on August 2, upwards of 4,000 Delta flight attendants were compensated for taking over 6,100 journeys during the disruptions.\n\nBastian addressed his personnel, stating, \"Your actions have been nothing short of heroic.\"\n\nThe two \"positive space\" passes that Bastian provided employees are confirmed seats, similar to those a customer would have. This contrasts with the complimentary standby flying that airline employees frequently engage in when there are available seats.\n\nThe Delta organizing committee of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which is currently engaged in a campaign to unionize Delta's flight attendants, stated that the offer of passes \"just isn't going to cut it.\" The organizing committee said in a written statement that airline management frequently implements \"mere adjustments to maintain the operation's functionality without implementing substantial changes to avert a future meltdown.\"\n\nDelta's operations have since stabilized; however, the flight cancellations and delays have resulted in the stranding of thousands of passengers and have tarnished Delta's reputation for reliability.

The lawsuit also alleges that CrowdStrike stock was trading \"at artificially high prices\" as a result of \"materially false and misleading statements and omissions.\"\n\nMillions of Windows hosts were affected by the faulty CrowdStrike update, which led to disruptions at major hospitals and airports and a wide range of public safety concerns (see: Microsoft Sees 8.5M Systems Hit by Faulty CrowdStrike Update). The software flaw caused Windows PCs to display the infamous \"blue screen of death\" in an endlessly reoccurring system reboot.\n\nCrowdStrike's stock prices plummeted nearly 32% following the global outage and wiped out nearly $25 billion of market value beginning July 19, according to the lawsuit. The investors said 911 hotlines became inoperable and airlines were forced to ground thousands of flights after a system issue allowed the update to go through without proper testing.\n\n\"Since the CrowdStrike Outage, publicly revealed evidence indicates that CrowdStrike was taking insufficient precautions regarding such updates,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nNearly all affected Windows PCs have resumed normal operations, according to CrowdStrike. CEO George Kurtz offered an apology on LinkedIn, saying: \"I am deeply sorry for the disruption this outage has caused and personally apologize to everyone impacted.\"\n\n\"While I can't promise perfection, I can promise a response that is focused, effective, and with a sense of urgency,\" Kurtz said, adding that the company's recovery efforts have been aided by automatic techniques.

The content was published to Windows hosts running sensor version 7.11 and above, according to the CrowdStrike update.\n\nThe update contained \"problematic content, which caused affected Windows systems to crash due to an out-of-bounds memory read,\" CrowdStrike said.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it is working with government and industry partners to understand the impact of the IT outage and provide additional support.", "source": {"uri": "cybersecuritydive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cybersecuritydive.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_jones@cybersecuritydive.com", "name": "David Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Memory safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government Accountability Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarWinds", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SolarWinds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Programming language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_and_Infrastructure_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett_Packard_Enterprise", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SAP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/System_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/System Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/imgproxy/SklQX6g61PzPGy70fWWefuWm_3lqorTq-gYo-RvjNvg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTIxNjI2NTYxNDAuanBn.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790488", "eventUri": "eng-9790488", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 420, "textEnd": 427, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

The S&P 500 declined 1.84% to close the trading session at 5,346.56. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.43% to finish at 16,776.16, leading to a more than 10% drop from the tech-heavy index's all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.51% to close at 39,737.26. The index's session low was a drop of 989 points. On the jobs front, nonfarm payrolls increased by only 114,000 in July, according to the Labor Department. That's down from the 179,000 jobs that were added in June and well below the expected 185,000 from economists polled by Dow Jones. With that, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, which is the highest since October 2021. Follow live market updates.\n\nThe second half of earnings season is afoot, and there are many more names to watch. This week alone, more than 70 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to post their quarterly results, such as Disney and Eli Lilly. This comes amid a solid season overall so far, with almost 78% of companies beating estimates, per FactSet. On a year-over-year basis, the S&P 500's profit growth in the second quarter is on pace to surpass 11%. Here are the major earnings to look out for this week:\n\nCrowdStrike is denying responsibility for Delta's thousands of flight cancellations last month. On Sunday, the cybersecurity software company said that Delta Air Lines had rejected onsite help during the global IT outage on July 19 that led the airline to cancel more than 5,000 flights between then and July 25 - which was more than any of its rivals. CrowdStrike lawyer Michael Carlinsky, who is co-managing partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, wrote to Delta's lawyer David Boies over the weekend, saying that Delta's litigation threats \"contributed to a misleading narrative that CrowdStrike is responsible for Delta's IT decisions and response to the outage.\" This comes in response to Delta's CEO, Ed Bastian, telling CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" last week that the cancellations in the wake of the outage cost the company about $500 million.\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has cut nearly half of its Apple stake. In an earnings filing, the conglomerate disclosed that its holding in Apple was valued at $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. That suggests Berkshire trimmed more than 49% of its stake in the iPhone maker. This comes after the Oracle of Omaha had also trimmed his stake in Apple by 13% in the first quarter. That said, Apple still remains far and away the largest stock stake for Berkshire. That's not all that was offloaded in the second quarter. In all, Berkshire saw more than $75 billion in stocks sold in the period, bringing its cash fortress to a record $277 billion.\n\nThe office of Michigan's secretary of state is investigating an Elon Musk-backed political action committee. The America PAC, which Musk said he created and helped fund, has been acquiring detailed voter information from people who live in Michigan and other battleground states after they submit their personal data through a section on its website that says \"register to vote.\" After clicking on that section, those in states like Michigan can submit a ZIP code, address and phone number. Those with a Michigan address specifically are then brought to a page that says \"thank you\" and asks users to \"complete the form below.\" But as of Sunday afternoon, there was no other form to complete underneath \"thank you.\" To be sure, legal experts are uncertain if any Michigan laws have been broken by the PAC.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New

The mid-morning blackout of Microsoft services was an unexpected hit that shut down business as usual. Airlines in particular were severely impacted by this outage as it canceled and delayed many flights. At non-unionized airlines such as Delta, this temporary shutdown has exposed and exacerbated already existing issues.\n\nAs other airlines recovered quickly from the shutdown, the problems at Delta extended for a week. Crew scheduling and operational support at Delta is extremely low-staffed. Delta employs as little as 53 crew schedulers, in comparison to United and Spirit Airlines, which have over 100 crew schedulers and American Airlines, with over 200. In times of crisis the incredible workload put on Delta workers becomes impossible to manage.\n\nThe airline, without any capacity to even locate their own flight attendants, asked crews to fill out surveys to figure out their locations. Many flight attendants have shared horror stories of Delta's mishandlings of the situation.\n\nFlight attendants stated that they were evicted from their hotels after Delta couldn't be reached to extend their reservations. By the time the company told flight attendants book their own hotel rooms, hotel prices had skyrocketed to over $1500 per night in some cities. Many flight attendants, especially younger or newer workers, have spoken out about not having the funds to front the cost of a hotel room and being forced to sleep in airport lounges. Flight attendants have been forced to wait online for over 12 hours in attempts to reach scheduling or hotel support to no avail. Many flight attendants were stranded away from home for days.\n\nIn these times of crises, with the company totally unable to function, Delta management continued to insult workers at every opportunity.\n\nDelta management, rather than doing whatever was necessary to get flight attendants home, handed out baggies of laundry detergent to workers in the Atlanta airport lounge. The CEO of Delta, Ed Bastian, has been under fire because midst all the chaos he and several members of the board of directors flew first class to Paris to attend the Olympics. Even as many people spoke out about the clear inequality between a CEO relaxing in first class and Delta flight attendants stranded without a place to sleep, Bastian has still refused to apologize or offer any aid to workers.\n\nUnfortunately, this response to the meltdown from Delta is not a surprise. It's only one example of the ways in which the company disrespects its workers every day. It is treatment like this that has motivated flight attendants to push to organize a union at Delta, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.\n\nThe Delta flight attendants have been up against union-busting tactics. In a statement in response to the meltdown, the Delta AFA steering committee said, \"Even though operational metrics have improved, Delta Flight Attendants are still trying to recover and get home from the operational meltdown.\n\nThe statement also noted, \"While Ed was flying to Paris Tuesday night, crew were sleeping in airports across the country. Flight attendants expect an apology and accountability. We provided a roadmap to recovery and care for the affected crew members. Instead of taking ownership, Ed took a first class seat. It's not acceptable.\"\n\nIt is clear that flight attendants want and deserve more from Delta - they want real support when things go wrong, and they want bargaining power. Despite the company's last ditch efforts, it seems like they will be unable to stop the power of their workers as they fight for representation and unionization.", "source": {"uri": "fightbacknews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fight Back!

I had seen a movie many years ago, entitled, 'Devil's Advocate.' I believe some of you must have seen that movie too.\n\n\"One of the starring characters: Al Pacino said, that pressure makes some people retreat or fail, and to others, it makes them become focused on succeeding.

You can imagine what that will do for the economy of the masses and the State.\n\n\"That is touching the lives of our people. It is not supporting them for selfish reasons. It is not giving a contract because I want somebody to fight somebody in my community. No. This is empowering the economy of the masses and the State.\n\n\"Our focus is that, no matter what anybody is doing anywhere, we are not going to lose focus. We want to leave here better than we had met it. And we want to also leave here without fear of anything.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara said, it is more desirable for a public leader to relish in the accolades from the majority of the people, who by exploring the conducive climate that is provided, could feed themselves and pay school fees for their children.\n\nThe governor emphatically said: \"That is what we want to hear, so that when before our children, our names are mentioned when we are no more, they will say: 'That man is a good man'.\n\n\"We will not oppress anybody. We will not force anybody against their will. We will not intimidate anybody, because intimidation has a time when it expires.\n\n\"When the time of intimidation expires, even as recorded of Pharaoh in the Bible, who intimidated the children of Israel, but it got to a time that the intimidation no longer worked.\n\n\"So, any bad thing that has a beginning, will have an end. So, that is why I said we don't have any problem. We have put that crisis behind us. We are looking ahead.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara, who reiterated that Rivers State is peaceful, said it takes a peaceful leader to bring about such an aura of peace to the State and its people.\n\nThe governor told his guests to dismiss the negative social media reports that tended to portray the State as a place immersed in uncontrollable violence and juxtapose it with what they have personally witnessed so that they can be better ambassadors of the state.\n\n\"Leadership and respect in leadership is not earned by force.

There is light everywhere.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara further told the committee members to note that it is normal for people to seek redress when they feel that their rights have been trampled upon.\n\nBut, he advised that when such complaints come to them, they should be thorough with their investigation, be fair and make their resolutions devoid of bias.\n\nHe said: \"Some of these people who write these petitions to you, I can say it, some of them are not even genuine. They believe that it is also a way to extort money from most of these companies that are doing business around us.\n\n\"So, I will urge you to do your investigation properly and let your finding be a result of proper and diligent investigation.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara also said: \"You mentioned something about the petition against Indorama Petrochemical and Fertiliser Company Limited, we are already aware of it.\n\n\"Funny enough, the Indorama case was even reported by Indorama itself.

But, God has placed you in this position today. It is for a purpose. So, use it to defend the oppressed people possibly in the course of justice. Defend them. Defend what is right. When it is wrong, say it with boldness.\"\n\nIn his address, the leader of the delegation and Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Public Petitions, Mike Etaba, explained that they came into Port Harcourt on the basis of a petition that is before the House and referred to the Committee.\n\nHe mentioned the petitioner as \"Bridge Gap Initiative\", a non-governmental organisation (NGO), in respect to some of the companies operating in the Trans-Amadi Industrial Layout of Rivers State.\n\nHe said: \"These companies are Schlumberger, Halliburton, Coca Cola and International Breweries. We have met with these companies that were able to oblige us their time.\n\n\"We went round to look at the issues that made us to come, especially the pollution of the water around Oginigba River. The companies were accused of discharging dangerous effluent into the river and also polluting the environment. That is the reason we came, and we have finished our assignment.\"\n\nEtaba used the opportunity to commend Governor Fubara on how he had handled the political crisis that erupted in the State, praising him for not allowing it to degenerate into violent physical clashes.\n\nHe said: \"Because you see, the battle of leadership comes from God Almighty.

The companies were accused of discharging dangerous effluent into the river, and also polluting the environment.

Mike Etaba, on a courtesy visit at Government House in Port Harcourt on Saturday night.\n\nThe governor declared that as long as his administration and Rivers people are concerned, there is no more political issue of note.\n\nGovernor Fubara while making reference to a movie he had seen a long time ago, explained how the pressure from the unwarranted political crisis served as an enabler to strengthen his commitment to service that is now impacting lives positively.\n\nHe said, \"As far as we are concerned, there are no political issues. I had seen a movie many years ago, entitled, 'Devil's Advocate.' I believe some of you must have seen that movie too.\n\n\"One of the starring characters, Al Pacino, said pressure makes some people retreat or fail, and to others, it makes them to become focused to succeed.\n\nWe have chosen to be focused under this pressure. \"That is why we are moving ahead. That is why we are making positive impacts in the lives of our people.\n\nGovernance is about the people. It is not about self. \"Governance is about touching the core needs of those people we are leading, and by the special grace of God, we are doing it.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara pointed to the empowerment of about 3,066 Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) when he flagged-off the N4 billion single digit loan scheme in conjunction with the Bank of Industry (BOI) Limited on Friday, as one way his administration is improving the socio-economic dynamics of the state.\n\n\"Yesterday, by the special grace of God, we observed the credit line of over 3,066 persons empowered. You can imagine what that will do for the economy of the masses and the state.\n\n\"That is touching the lives of our people. It is not supporting them for selfish reasons. It is not giving contract because I want somebody to fight somebody in my community. No. This is empowering the economy of the masses and the state.\n\n\"Our focus is that, no matter what anybody is doing anywhere, we are not going to lose focus. We want to leave here better than we had met it. And we want to also leave here without fear of anything.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara said it is more desirable for a public leader to relish in the accolades from the majority of the people, who by exploring the conducive climate that is provided, could feed themselves and pay school fees of their children.\n\n\"That is what we want to hear, so that when before our children, our names are mentioned when we are no more, they will say: 'that man is a good man'.\n\n\"We will not oppress anybody. We will not force anybody against their will. We will not intimidate anybody, because intimidation has a time it expires.\n\n\"When the time of intimidation expires, even as recorded of Pharaoh in the Bible, who intimidated the children of Israel, but it got to a time that the intimidation no longer worked.\n\n\"So, any bad thing that has a beginning, will have an end. So, that is why I said we don't have any problem. We have put that crisis behind us.\n\nWe are looking ahead,\" he added. Governor Fubara, who reiterated that Rivers State is peaceful, said it takes a peaceful leader to bring about such an aura of peace to the state and its people.\n\nThe governor told his guests to dismiss the negative social media reports that tended to portray the state as a place immersed in uncontrollable violence, and juxtapose it with what they have personally witnessed so that they can be better ambassadors of the state.\n\n\"Leadership and respect in leadership is not earned by force. It is your style that brings respect and love. And what we are doing is to respect our people, and in turn, our people are giving us that support for leadership.\n\n\"So, I am happy that you are here, and when you go back, tell others your own side of the story: that Rivers State is moving forward. Forget about what you see in the social media, there is progress everywhere here.\n\nThere is light everywhere.\" Governor Fubara further told the committee members to note that it is normal for people to seek redress when they feel that their right had been trampled upon.\n\nBut he advised that when such complaints come to them, they should be thorough with their investigation, be fair and make their resolutions devoid of bias.\n\nHe said, \"Some of these people who write these petitions to you, I can say it, some of them are not even genuine.\n\nThey believe that it is also a way to extort money from most of these companies that are doing business around us. \"So, I will urge you to do your investigation properly and let your finding be as a result of proper and diligent investigation,\" he added.\n\n\"You mentioned something about the petition against Indorama Petrochemical and Fertiliser Company Limited, we are already aware of it.\n\n\"Funny enough, the Indorama's case was even reported by Indorama itself. It is unfortunate that a particular person who got the privileged information went behind to use that information against the company. \"I just need to let you know that, just in case when you will be treating the case, you could factor this information.\n\nThose people can't come to us because they know we will look at them in the face, and tell them the truth.\"\n\nFubara further stated, \"Ordinarily, they ought to have come to us. They need to make the complaint first to the State Ministry of Environment before going ahead.\n\n\"So, you can see the kind of society that we find ourselves. But, God has placed you in this position today. It is for a purpose. So, use it to defend the oppressed people possibly in the course of justice.\n\nDefend them. Defend what is right. When it is wrong, say it with boldness.\" In his address, the leader of the delegation and Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Public Petitions, Hon. Mike Etaba, explained that they came into Port Harcourt on the basis of a petition that is before the House and referred to the committee.\n\nHe mentioned the petitioner as 'Bridge Gap Initiative', a non-governmental organisation (NGO), in respect to some of the companies operating in the Trans-Amadi Industrial Layout of Rivers State.\n\nHe said, \"These companies are Schlumberger, Halliburton, Coca Cola and International Breweries. We have met with these companies that were able to oblige us their time.\n\n\"We went round to look at the issues that made us to come, especially the pollution of the water around Oginigba River.\n\nThe companies were accused of discharging dangerous effluent into the river, and also polluting the environment.\n\nThat is the reason we came, and we have finished our assignment.\"\n\nHon. Etaba used the opportunity to commend Governor Fubara on how he had handled the political crisis that erupted in the state, praising him for not allowing it degenerate into violent physical clashes.\n\nHe said, \"Because you see, the battle of leadership comes from God Almighty. Nobody gives power. Power comes from God. If God uses any man to give you power, and that man arrogates power to himself, that man will be doing himself a disservice.\n\n\"So far, you have carried yourself as a man that has wisdom, dignity, and you are doing well. Your Excellency, don't be distracted, what you owe dearly is to hold unto God strongly.\n\n\"The Lord is your strength, and you will succeed in every decision that you take. Ask Him for wisdom, He will direct you,\" he added.\n\nHe pledged the committee's support, and urged all people of goodwill in the state to rally support and remain strong in their tenacious loyalty to the governor to enable him succeed in delivering good governance and quality leadership to Rivers people.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Independent Newspapers Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminalayi_Fubara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siminalayi Fubara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House,_Sydney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government House, Sydney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Pacino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharaoh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Halliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Fubara-1xp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540652", "eventUri": "eng-9540652", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Mike Etaba disclosed this to Governor Siminalayi Fubara at Government House, Port Harcourt on Saturday evening that Companies like Coca-cola,Halliburton, International Breweries and Schlumberger are among those fingered.\n\nGovernor Fubara used opportunity of the visit to tell his guests that despite the political pressures and distractions that his administration has moved on with governance.\n\nThe remarks of Governor Fubara were contained in a press statement issued by Nelson Chukwudi the Chief Press Secretary, CPS,to the Governor.\n\nHe said the Governor declared that as long as his Administration and Rivers people he is leading are concerned, there is no more political issue of note.\n\nMaking reference to a movie he had seen long time ago, Governor Fubara explained how the pressure from the unwarranted political crisis served as an enabler to strengthen his commitment to service that is now impacting lives positively.\n\nHe said, \"As far as we are concerned, there are no political issues.

It is not about self.\n\n\"Governance is about touching the core needs of those people we are leading, and by the special grace of God, we are doing it.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara pointed to the empowerment of about 3,066 Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) when he flagged-off the N4billion single digit loan scheme in conjunction with the Bank of Industry (BOI) Limited on Friday, as one way his Administration is improving the socio-economic dynamics of the State.\n\n\"Yesterday, by the special grace of God, we observed the credit line of over 3,066 persons empowered. You can imagine what that will do for the economy of the masses and the State.\n\n\"That is touching the lives of our people. It is not supporting them for selfish reasons. It is not giving contract because I want somebody to fight somebody in my community. No. This is empowering the economy of the masses and the State.\n\n\"Our focus is that, no matter what anybody is doing anywhere, we are not going to lose focus. We want to leave here better than we had met it. And we want to also leave here without fear of anything.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara said, it is more desirable for a public leader to relish in the accolades from the majority of the people, who by exploring the conducive climate that is provided, could feed themselves and pay school fees of their children.\n\nThe Governor emphatically said: \"That is what we want to hear, so that when before our children, our names are mentioned when we are no more, they will say: 'that man is a good man'.\n\n\"We will not oppress anybody. We will not force anybody against their will. We will not intimidate anybody, because intimidation has a time it expires.\n\n\"When the time of intimidation expires, even as recorded of Pharaoh in the Bible, who intimidated the children of Israel, but it got to a time that the intimidation no longer worked.\n\n\"So, any bad thing that has a beginning, will have an end. So, that is why I said we don't have any problem. We have put that crisis behind us. We are looking ahead.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara, who reiterated that Rivers State is peaceful, said it takes a peaceful leader to bring about such aura of peace to the State and its people.\n\nThe Governor told his guests to dismiss the negative social media reports that tended to portray the State as a place immersed in uncontrollable violence, and juxtapose it with what they have personally witnessed so that they can be better ambassadors of the State.\n\n\"Leadership and respect in leadership is not earned by force. It is your style that brings respect and love. And what we are doing is to respect our people, and in turn, our people are giving us that support for leadership.\n\n\"So, I am happy that you are here, and when you go back, tell others your own side of the story: that Rivers State is moving forward. Forget about what you see in the social media, there is progress everywhere here. There is light everywhere.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara further told the committee members to note that it is normal for people to seek redress when they feel that their right had been trampled upon.\n\nBut he advised that when such complains come to them, they should be thorough with their investigation, be fair and make their resolutions devoid of bias.\n\nHe said, \"Some of these people who write these petitions to you, I can say it, some of them are not even genuine. They believe that it is also a way to extort money from most of these companies that are doing business around us.\n\n\"So, I will urge you to do your investigation properly and let your finding be as a result of proper and diligent investigation,\" he added.\n\nGovernor Fubara also said: \"You mentioned something about the petition against Indorama Petrochemical and Fertiliser Company Limited, we are already aware of it.\n\n\"Funny enough, the Indorama's case was even reported by Indorama itself. It is unfortunate that a particular person who got the privileged information went behind to use that information against the company.\n\n\"I just need to let you know that, just in case when you will be treating the case, you could factor this information. Those people can't come to us because they know we will look at them in the face, and tell them the truth.\n\n\"Ordinarily, they ought to have come to us. They need to make the complain first to the State Ministry of Environment before going ahead.\n\n\"So, you can see the kind of society that we find ourselves. But, God has placed you in this position today. It is for a purpose. So, use it to defend the oppressed people possibly in the course of justice. Defend them. Defend what is right. When it is wrong, say it with boldness,\" the Governor added.\n\nIn his address, the leader of the delegation and Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Public Petitions, Hon. Mike Etaba, explained that they came into Port Harcourt on the basis of a petition that is before the House and referred to the Committee.\n\nHe mentioned the petitioner as \"Bridge Gap Initiative\", a non-governmental organisation (NGO), in respect to some of the companies operating in the Trans-Amadi Industrial Layout of Rivers State.\n\nHe said, \"These companies are Schlumberger, Halliburton, Coca Cola and International Breweries. We have met with these companies that were able to oblige us their time.\n\n\"We went round to look at the issues that made us to come, especially the pollution of the water around Oginigba River. The companies were accused of discharging dangerous effluent into the river, and also polluting the environment. That is the reason we came, and we have finished our assignment.\"\n\nHon. Etaba used the opportunity to commend Governor Fubara on how he had handled the political crisis that erupted in the State, praising him for not allowing it degenerate into violent physical clashes.\n\nHe said, \"Because you see, the battle of leadership comes from God Almighty. Nobody gives power. Power comes from God. If God uses any man to give you power, and that man arrogates power to himself, that man will be doing himself a disservice.\n\n\"So far, you have carried yourself as a man that has wisdom, dignity, and you are doing well. Your Excellency, don't be distracted, what you owe dearly is to hold unto God strongly.\n\n\"The Lord is your strength, and you will succeed in every decision that you take. Ask Him for wisdom, He will direct you,\" he added.\n\nHe pledged the committee's support, and urged all people of goodwill in the State to rally support and remain strong in their tenacious loyalty to the Governor to enable him succeed in delivering good governance and quality leadership to Rivers people.", "source": {"uri": "thenewsnigeria.com.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminalayi_Fubara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siminalayi Fubara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Rivers_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Rivers State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House,_Sydney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government House, Sydney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House,_Port_Harcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government House, Port Harcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_Amadi,_Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trans Amadi, Port Harcourt"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Pacino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlumberger", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Schlumberger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharaoh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://thenewsnigeria.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2024/05/Screenshot_20240506-063147.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540652", "eventUri": "eng-9540652", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

I have shown respect. I've subjected myself to every meeting of reconciliation for peace. And what happens, each time we come out from such meetings, we are faced with one thunder or lightening.\"\n\nThe Governor pointed out that when he assumed office, it was with the resolve to build on the existing foundation of development of past leaders, especially the immediate past governor.\n\nGovernor Fubara emphasised that it would have been out of the ordinary to engage in any political fight when there was so much work to be done for the State and its people as their Governor.\n\nHe said, he strongly felt that it was proper to set some records straight about what had become of a minor problem that was not uncommon in every human relationship.\n\nGovernor Fubara stated: \"But it is a bad thing when the problem that ought not to be anything, becomes something, and in fact, gets out of the bedroom to the sitting room and to the compound. That is the case of Rivers State today.\n\n\"I am also happy that you even mentioned the issues, even when I have all the instruments of State powers. I have shown restrain, and I believe that whoever is alive and have been following the activities of our dear State, knows that I have acted as a big brother in the course of this crisis.\n\n\"I have not acted like a young man that may want the house to be destroyed but I have behaved like a matured young man that I am. This is because I know that no meaningful development will be achieved in an atmosphere of crisis.\n\n\"And because our intention for Rivers State is to build on the foundation that had been laid by our past leaders, it will be wrong for me to take the path of promoting crisis. That is why we are still recording the development that you are hearing around Rivers State.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara insisted that there was nothing wrong in one helping another person but that does not mean the helper should take the place of God.\n\nThe Governor said, as long as he was concerned, God will remain God, who could sometimes cause one's enemy to be willing vessel to bring about one's promotion in life.\n\nHe said, \"God can do anything He wants to do when He wants to do it. It is only for us to realize that. God will not come down from Heaven but will pass through one man or woman to achieve His purpose.\n\n\"So, for that reason, when we act, we act as humans; human vessels that God has used, and not seeing yourself as God.\n\n\"I want to say this clearly that we appreciate the role our leaders, most especially the immediate past governor, played. But that is not enough for me to worship a human being. I can't do that.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara took a swipe against the Rt Hon. Martin Amaewhule-led group of lawmakers, and declared that they do not exist anymore as lawmakers in the eyes of the law.\n\n\"Let me say it here, those group of men who claim that they are assembly members, they are not existing. I want it to be on record.\n\n\"I accepted that peace accord to give them a floating (soft-landing). That's the truth. There is nothing in that peace accord that is a constitutional issue. It is a political solution to a problem. I accepted it because these are people that were visiting me and we were together in my house.\n\n\"These are people that I have helped... in many ways when I wasn't even a Governor. Yes, we might have our disagreements, but I believe that one day, we could also come together. That was the reason I did it.\n\n\"But I think it has gotten to a time when I need to make a statement on this thing, so that they understand that they are not existing. Their existence and whatever they have been doing is because I allowed them to do so. If I don't recognize them, they are nowhere, that is the truth.\"\n\nThe Governor further said: \"So, I want you to see the sacrifice I have made to allow peace to be in our State. I can say here, with all amount of boldness, I have never called any police man anywhere to go and harass anybody.\n\n\"I have never gone anywhere to ask anybody to do anything against anybody. But what happens to the people that are supporting me? They are being harassed, they are being arrested and detained. There is no week that somebody doesn't come here with one letter of invitation for trump-up charges and all those things.\n\n\"I am saying all these because of what my senior said here: restrain. I don't think the other party has shown any restrain. I am the one that has shown restrain in the face of this crisis.\n\n\"I am the one that is badly hit, even when I have all the government instruments to shake up the table. But, why will I do it? I believe that peace is the best relationship to cultivate.\"\n\nSpeaking further, Governor Fubara thanked the delegation for coming to solidarise with him and his Government, and noted that\n\nthere is no complete Rivers State without Bayelsa State and vice versa, which demands that they continue to work together for development.\n\nHe said, \"We were separated because of political purposes to expand development, but we need to be united so that the economies of these two states will grow.\n\n\"There is no need for us to have any argument over assets, there is no need for us to have disagreement over issue of who owns this or who doesn't own that.\n\n\"One way or the other, we are even inter-related. That is the truth. So, there is no need for fight.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara said he took the initiative of going to see Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State because he wanted an end to the toxic relationship that existed in the past administrations.\n\n\"We had our meeting and by the grace of God, we've had a very wonderful relationship. He's always there watching out for me. Even in the face of this crisis, things my commissioner ought to do, when they hide the information from me, he calls me to tell me.\n\n\"You don't know what I am going through. I am working with my own enemies. Imagine where your Attorney-General will go to sabotage you. It was as bad as that. But, they will get their reward.\n\n\"So, you see, if I have not gone to reconcile with my brother, I would have been in bigger mess. So, I have already started benefiting, reaping the fruits of that peaceful relationship.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara also regretted that Rivers State was experiencing such protracted political crisis because there are no leaders of conscience who could stand up boldly and mediate on issues without bias.\n\nIn his remark earlier, leader of the delegation and former governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Henry Seriake Dickson, said their visit was one of solidarity with Governor Siminalayi Fubara and Rivers people who have shown maturity in the face of the political crisis for stability and development to thrive.\n\nHe said, \"Your Excellency, we will agree that no true brother or even good neighbour can stay unconcerned when the house of a brother or neighbour is on fire or have issue. Even if there is a small flame, a neighbour or a good brother should be concerned.\n\n\"We have come here as your brothers and as good neighbours also. But also in our own right as Rivers people because this State is our Mother State.\n\n\"And we are here to show support and solidarity with you, your Government, and most importantly, solidarize with the good people of this State.\n\n\"We have also come with a message Your Excellency, of peace and reconciliation, forgiveness, unity, mutual respect, political maturity and tolerance by all.\"\n\nHe added that if there is peace and development in Rivers State, the people of Bayelsa State will benefit, and if there is crisis in the State, his people will suffer as well, and called on all sides to give peace a chance.\n\nChief Press Secretary to the Rivers State Governor", "source": {"uri": "puoreports.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "PUO REPORTS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminalayi_Fubara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siminalayi Fubara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Seriake_Dickson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Seriake Dickson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Rivers_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Rivers State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House,_Sydney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government House, Sydney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Rivers_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Rivers State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribal chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayelsa_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douye_Diri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douye Diri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://puoreports.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FB_IMG_1715022847395.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540652", "eventUri": "eng-9540652", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

I have shown restraint, and I believe that whoever is alive and has been following the activities of our dear state, knows that I have acted as a big brother in the course of this crisis.\n\n\"I have not acted like a young man who may want the house to be destroyed but I have behaved like the mature young man that I am. This is because I know that no meaningful development will be achieved in an atmosphere of crisis.\n\n\"And because our intention for Rivers State is to build on the foundation that had been laid by our past leaders, it will be wrong for me to take the path of promoting crisis.\n\n\"That is why we are still recording the development that you are hearing around Rivers State.\"\n\nFubara took a swipe at the Martin Amaewhule-led group of lawmakers and declared that they do not exist anymore as lawmakers in the eyes of the law.\n\n\"Let me say it here, those groups of men who claim that they are assembly members, they are not existing. I want it to be on record.\n\n\"I accepted that peace accord to give them a floating (soft-landing). That's the truth. There is nothing in that peace accord that is a constitutional issue. It is a political solution to a problem. I accepted it because there were people that were visiting me and we were together in my house.\n\n\"These are people that I have helped... in many ways when I wasn't even a Governor. Yes, we might have our disagreements, but I believe that one day, we could also come together. That was the reason I did it.\n\n\"But I think it has gotten to a time when I need to make a statement on this thing, so that they understand that they are not existing. Their existence and whatever they have been doing is because I allowed them to do so. If I don't recognise them, they are nowhere, that is the truth,\" he said.\n\nContinuing, the governor said: \"So, I want you to see the sacrifice I have made to allow peace to be in our State. I can say here, with all amount of boldness, I have never called any policeman anywhere to go and harass anybody.\n\n\"I have never gone anywhere to ask anybody to do anything against anybody. But what happens to the people that are supporting me? They are being harassed, they are being arrested and detained.\n\n\"There is no week that somebody doesn't come here with one letter of invitation for trump-up charges and all those things.\n\n\"I am saying all these because of what my senior said here: restrain. I don't think the other party has shown any restraint. I am the one who has shown restraint in the face of this crisis.\n\n\"I am the one that is badly hit, even when I have all the government instruments to shake up the table. But, why will I do it? I believe that peace is the best relationship to cultivate.\"\n\nSpeaking further, Fubara thanked the delegation for coming to solidarise with him and his Government and noted that there is no complete Rivers State without Bayelsa State and vice versa, which demands that they continue to work together for development.\n\nHe said, \"We were separated because of political purposes to expand development, but we need to be united so that the economies of these two states will grow.\n\n\"There is no need for us to have any argument over assets, there is no need for us to have a disagreement over the issue of who owns this or who doesn't own that.\n\n\"One way or the other, we are even inter-related. That is the truth. So, there is no need to fight.\"\n\nThe governor said he took the initiative of going to see Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State because he wanted an end to the toxic relationship that existed in the past administrations.\n\n\"We had our meeting and by the grace of God, we've had a very wonderful relationship. He's always there watching out for me. Even in the face of this crisis, things my commissioner ought to do, when they hide the information from me, he calls me to tell me.\n\n\"You don't know what I am going through. I am working with my own enemies. Imagine where your Attorney-General will go to sabotage you. It was as bad as that. But, they will get their reward.\n\n\"So, you see, if I had not gone to reconcile with my brother, I would have been in a bigger mess. So, I have already started benefiting, reaping the fruits of that peaceful relationship.\"\n\nFubara also regretted that Rivers State was experiencing such a protracted political crisis because there were no leaders of conscience who could stand up boldly and mediate on issues without bias.\n\nIn his remark earlier, the leader of the delegation and former governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Henry Seriake Dickson, said their visit was one of solidarity with Governor Siminalayi Fubara and Rivers people who have shown maturity in the face of the political crisis for stability and development to thrive.\n\nHe said, \"Your Excellency, we will agree that no true brother or even good neighbour can stay unconcerned when the house of a brother or neighbour is on fire or has an issue. Even if there is a small flame, a neighbour or a good brother should be concerned.\n\n\"We have come here as your brothers and as good neighbours also. But also in our own right as Rivers people because this State is our Mother State.\n\n\"And we are here to show support and solidarity with you, your Government, and most importantly, solidarize with the good people of this State.\n\n\"We have also come with a message Your Excellency, of peace and reconciliation, forgiveness, unity, mutual respect, political maturity and tolerance by all.\"", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dennis_naku@punchng.com", "name": "Dennis Naku", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminalayi_Fubara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siminalayi Fubara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyesom_Wike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nyesom Wike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Seriake_Dickson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Seriake Dickson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Rivers_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Rivers State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House,_Sydney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government House, Sydney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayelsa_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douye_Diri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douye Diri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/09184117/Siminalayi-Fubara.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540652", "eventUri": "eng-9540652", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

So, that is why I said we don't have any problem. We have put that crisis behind us. We are looking ahead.\"\n\nMr Fubara stated this on Saturday in Government House, Port Harcourt, in a meeting with members of the House of Representatives Committee on Public Petitions.\n\nIn a statement sent to PREMIUM TIMES on Sunday, the spokesperson to the governor, Nelson Chukwudi, said the governor declared that there was no more issue of note as far as his administration and the people of the state were concerned.\n\nGovernor Fubara stated this against the political feud with his predecessor, Nyesom Wike, which has persisted despite the intervention of President Bola Tinubu, who brokered a peace deal between them.\n\nMr Wike, now minister of FCT, played a pivotal role in the emergence of Mr Fubara as governor, but the two former allies later fell out as a result of disagreement over the control of political structure and governance in the oil-rich state.\n\nThe crisis prompted the resignation of two pro-Wike commissioners serving in Mr Fubara's cabinet in protest over their redeployment to other ministries.\n\nThe crisis has also pitched the pro-Wike Rivers Assembly against Governor Fubara, leading to lawmakers dispensing with Mr Fubara's assent to bills.\n\nBut speaking at the meeting with the federal lawmakers, Mr Fubara said there was no more crisis in the state, saying he was focusing on governance.\n\nJustifying his position, the governor told the lawmakers that the state government was now focusing on governance and had on Friday flagged off a N4 billion loan scheme to Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in the state.\n\n\"Governance is about touching the core needs of those we are leading, and by the special grace of God, we are doing it.\"\n\n\"Yesterday, by the special grace of God, we observed the credit line of over 3,066 persons empowered. You can imagine what that will do for the economy of the masses and the State.\n\n\"That is touching the lives of our people. It is not supporting them for selfish reasons. It is not giving contracts because I want somebody to fight somebody in my community. No. This is empowering the economy of the masses and the State.\n\n\"Our focus is that, no matter what anybody is doing anywhere, we are not going to lose focus. We want to leave here better than we met it. And we want to leave here without fear,\" Governor Fubara said.\n\n'Lord is your strength' - Committee chairperson\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, the Committee Chairperson, Mike Etaba, told Governor Fubara that their visit was triggered by a petition against some companies operating at the Trans-Amadi Industrial Layout by a non-governmental organisation in the state, Bridge Gap Initiative.\n\nMr Etaba said, \"These companies are Schlumberger, Halliburton, Coca Cola and International Breweries. We have met with these companies that could oblige us with their time.\n\n\"We went round to look at the issues that made us come, especially the pollution of the water around Oginigba River. The companies were accused of discharging dangerous effluent into the river and polluting the environment. That is the reason we came, and we have finished our assignment.\"\n\nThe committee chairperson commended Mr Fubara for not allowing the political crisis in the state to degenerate into violent clashes.\n\nREAD ALSO: Fubara-Wike politics, killing of police inspector, other top stories from South-south\n\n\"Because you see, the battle of leadership comes from God Almighty.

It is only for us to realize that. God will not come down from Heaven but will pass through one man or woman to achieve His purpose.\n\n\"So, for that reason, when we act, we act as humans; human vessels that God has used, and not seeing yourself as God.\n\n\"I want to say this clearly that we appreciate the role our leaders, most especially the immediate past governor, played. But that is not enough for me to worship a human being. I can't do that.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara also took a swipe at the Martin Amaewhule-led Rivers State House of Assembly, emphasising that they do not exist anymore as lawmakers in the eyes of the law.\n\n\"Let me say it here, those group of men who claim that they are assembly members, they are not existing. I want it to be on record.\n\n\"I accepted that peace accord to give them a floating (soft-landing). That's the truth. There is nothing in that peace accord that is a constitutional issue. It is a political solution to a problem. I accepted it because these are people that were visiting me and we were together in my house.\n\n\"These are people that I have helped... in many ways when I wasn't even a Governor. Yes, we might have our disagreements, but I believe that one day, we could also come together. That was the reason I did it.\n\nHe added, \"But I think it has gotten to a time when I need to make a statement on this thing, so that they understand that they are not existing. Their existence and whatever they have been doing is because I allowed them to do so. If I don't recognize them, they are nowhere, that is the truth.\"\n\nThe Governor noted that he had allowed the sleeping dogs lie for the sake of maintaining peace in the state, noting that he had not gone anywhere to plot anyone's downfall.\n\n\"So, I want you to see the sacrifice I have made to allow peace to be in our State. I can say here, with all amount of boldness, I have never called any policeman anywhere to go and harass anybody.\n\n\"I have never gone anywhere to ask anybody to do anything against anybody. But what happens to the people that are supporting me? They are being harassed, they are being arrested and detained. There is no week that somebody doesn't come here with one letter of invitation for trump-up charges and all those things.\n\nFubara further stated, \"I am saying all these because of what my senior said here: restrain. I don't think the other party has shown any restraint. I am the one that has shown restraint in the face of this crisis.\n\n\"I am the one that is badly hit, even when I have all the government instruments to shake up the table. But, why will I do it? I believe that peace is the best relationship to cultivate.\"\n\nThe Governor maintained that he had acted like the big brother in the crisis, not interested in destroying the 'house', so that meaningful development can continue to be engendered in the State while securing a tenable political relationship.\n\n\"But I know that I have always taken the path of peace. I have shown respect. I've subjected myself to every meeting of reconciliation for peace. And what happens, each time we come out from such meetings, we are faced with one thunder or lightening.\"\n\nHe pointed out that when he assumed office, it was with the resolve to build on the existing foundation of development of past leaders, especially the immediate past governor.\n\nGovernor Fubara emphasised that it would have been out of the ordinary to engage in any political fight when there was so much work to be done for the State and its people as their Governor.\n\nHe added that he strongly felt that it was proper to set some records straight about what had become of a minor problem that was not uncommon in every human relationship.\n\n\"But it is a bad thing when the problem that ought not to be anything, becomes something, and in fact, gets out of the bedroom to the sitting room and to the compound. That is the case of Rivers State today.\n\n\"I am also happy that you even mentioned the issues, even when I have all the instruments of State powers. I have shown restraint, and I believe that whoever is alive and have been following the activities of our dear State, knows that I have acted as a big brother in the course of this crisis.\n\n\"I have not acted like a young man that may want the house to be destroyed but I have behaved like a matured young man that I am. This is because I know that no meaningful development will be achieved in an atmosphere of crisis.\n\n\"And because our intention for Rivers State is to build on the foundation that had been laid by our past leaders, it will be wrong for me to take the path of promoting crisis. That is why we are still recording the development that you are hearing around Rivers State.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara also thanked the delegation for coming to show solidarity with him and his administration, noting that there is no complete Rivers State without Bayelsa State and vice versa, which demands that they continue to work together for development.\n\nHe said, \"We were separated because of political purposes to expand development, but we need to be united so that the economies of these two states will grow.\n\n\"There is no need for us to have any argument over assets, there is no need for us to have disagreement over issues of who owns this or who doesn't own that.\n\n\"One way or the other, we are even interrelated. That is the truth. So, there is no need for fight.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara said he took the initiative of going to see Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State because he wanted an end to the toxic relationship that existed in the past administrations.\n\n\"We had our meeting and by the grace of God, we've had a very wonderful relationship. He's always there watching out for me. Even in the face of this crisis, things my commissioner ought to do, when they hide the information from me, he calls me to tell me.\n\n\"You don't know what I am going through. I am working with my own enemies. Imagine where your Attorney-General will go to sabotage you. It was as bad as that. But, they will get their reward.\n\n\"So, you see, if I have not gone to reconcile with my brother, I would have been in bigger mess. So, I have already started benefiting, reaping the fruits of that peaceful relationship.\"\n\nFubara regretted that the State had experienced such a protracted political crisis because there are no leaders of conscience who could stand up boldly and mediate on issues without bias.\n\nIn his remark earlier, leader of the delegation and former governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Henry Seriake Dickson, said their visit was one of solidarity with Governor Siminalayi Fubara and Rivers people who have shown maturity in the face of the political crisis for stability and development to thrive.\n\nHe said, \"Your Excellency, we will agree that no true brother or even good neighbour can stay unconcerned when the house of a brother or neighbour is on fire or have issue. Even if there is a small flame, a neighbour or a good brother should be concerned.\n\n\"We have come here as your brothers and as good neighbours also. But also in our own right as Rivers people because this State is our Mother State.\n\n\"And we are here to show support and solidarity with you, your Government, and most importantly, solidarize with the good people of this State.\n\n\"We have also come with a message Your Excellency, of peace and reconciliation, forgiveness, unity, mutual respect, political maturity and tolerance by all.\"\n\nHe added that if there is peace and development in Rivers State, the people of Bayelsa State will benefit, and if there is crisis in the State, his people will suffer as well, and called on all sides to give peace a chance.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Independent Newspapers Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminalayi_Fubara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siminalayi Fubara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyesom_Wike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nyesom Wike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Seriake_Dickson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Seriake Dickson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State_House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayelsa_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douye_Diri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douye Diri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Fubara-1b-CREDIT-X-@channelstv-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540652", "eventUri": "eng-9540652", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

This was at the thanksgiving church service at the Saint Paul's Anglican Church, Opobo Town in Opobo/Nkoro Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe statement appeared innocuous especially at other times and to non-initiates but those who know the toxicity of the war that was just starting between godson and godfather would know the gravity of that statement.\n\nFubara was an unassuming accountant who was made Accountant-General of Rivers State by then Governor Wike. Soon after, Fubara became the closest confidant of the boss, Wike. When it was time for primaries, Wike single-handedly bought all forms gave a form to each of the persons he wanted in any position, thus making each position unopposed in the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. Wike went to any length to crush every single opposition to the strategy and forced consensus on the undemocratic method, thus securing legitimacy to it because consensus is democratic.\n\nIt was with fear and trepidation that everybody steered clear of Wike's project or choice, and only called Wike names, some saying Fubara was Wike's third term agenda.\n\nFubara won both the primaries and the main election and was sworn in on May 29, 2023 as governor of Rivers State and chief executive of the state administration.\n\nFubara also said the battles against his tenure as governor had been fierce but that God, who rules in the affairs of men, has saddled him with the responsibility of steering the affairs of the state as its governor.\n\n\"But one thing we can't take away is that God does not make any mistake. Whatever happens, and when it happens, it is for a purpose,\" he said.\n\nGovernor Fubara said the battles against his administration may not be entirely over but the distractions are being set aside because he is more focused on delivering good governance to the people of Rivers State.\n\n\"We came in; we were selected because they believed we have something that we will do for our state. We have not been given the opportunity to do those things that we ought to do for our state.\n\n\"We have had a lot of distractions but I strongly believe that while we navigate the path of peace, prayer is also needed for us to pass over this phase. Continue to put us in your prayers. There is nothing that God cannot do.\"\n\nAfter God, Fubara chose some important persons to thank but Wike was not one of them. Instead, he expressed appreciation to President Bola Tinubu for his role in the victory being celebrated, and to the leaders of the state and numerous supporters who were either provoked or persecuted for standing by the truth.\n\nAdmitted, crisis erupted between them, but the statement on January 14, 2024, seemed to dawn on Wike that he had lost any hold on Fubara since credit had been removed from him or any man. From that time onward, any time thanksgiving was announced for Governor Fubara, anxiety developed in the Wike camp; what next would he say. If Wike was no longer the 'Mr Fix It' of the victory, then, it would mean a lot, according to political pundits.\n\nTo add to the anxiety, in his sermon, Emmanuel Oko-Jaja, the Bishop of the Diocese of Niger Delta of the Anglican Communion, who noted that the victory celebrated by Governor Fubara was for the entire state, said no one man can hold the state to ransom because God is in charge. The Wike camp seemed to take more note.\n\nSoon, the thanksgiving moved from local council to local council, and then to all the 319 wards in the state. Some opposition leaders claimed it was costing the state over N5Bn at the rate of N150m per event. The administration has since denied it was being sponsored by the state government.\n\nThe next significant statement made by the governor at the thanksgiving services that seemed to annoy the Wike camp is that the crowds trailing the rallies showed that the SIMplified Movement (the new support group being built for Fubara) was organic. This was understood in the All Progressives Congress (APC) which now seems to be the Wike camp, to mean that Wike's rallies and supporters were bought, while Fubara's were spontaneous or organic.\n\nThe statements seemed to encourage the Simplified Movement followers anywhere the thanksgiving services were to be held to air their grievances against Wike and his administration. Inuendoes became the new art in Rivers State.\n\nTo show that these remarks and direct attacks were hitting hard at Wike, the new arrowhead of his support base, Tony Okocha, who is the caretaker committee chairman of the state's APC and is also the Rivers State Representative in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), addressed a press conference where he attacked Fubara.\n\nOkocha declared Fubara a total failure in office in nine months (when it was not yet first one year in office), and accused the governor of allowing his supporters to use the thanksgiving services to insult Wike. They usually add Tinubu, though nowhere had Fubara or his supporters made any insulting statement against Tinubu. If any, such a statement is not yet in the public domain.\n\nWhat was however, significant was that the thanksgiving services became rallies, political rallies. The organisers of the services seemed to make adjustments by making them look real and by separating political remarks from sermons. At the end of each service, then, political talks were allowed, mostly on support for Fubara.\n\nThere is no doubt that the thanksgiving church services began to make impact and began to mobilise huge crowds and support for Fubara who had no structure before then.\n\nObservers such as Eze Chukwuemeka Eze said the things being said at Fubara rallies or by Fubara supporters were responses to things said by Wike and his supporters. They had accused Fubara of lack of structure. This may have led to the building of the SIMplified Movement through thanksgiving events.\n\nWike was attending birthday parties and other events in Rivers State where he used such opportunities to attack Fubara, to threaten him, and to vilify him. It was at one of such events that he said he could not wait till 2027 to teach them a lesson. Many understood this to mean \"dethronement\" of Fubara.\n\nThe opposition also did some thanksgiving where they also did what they accused Fubara of. The APC led by Okocha hosted a thanksgiving service at the Polo Field in GRA where Martins Amaewhule (controversial speaker), said a lot of things against the governor. Okocha has also just held a thanksgiving service in Rumuigbo where he said the world should come and see what organic support was, and not by paying people.\n\nWhat seemed to play out was that while Wike and his supporters used parties to attack Fubara, the governor's supporters used thanksgiving services to respond.\n\nNow, the governor seemed to have found other avenues to ventilate his emotions and to make revelations. He used the auspices of the visit of the National Assembly Committee on Refineries to announce that he is now seeing N27bn in internal revenue (IGR), a bombshell that seemed to hit hard. The citizens are asking where N14bn was going every month. The APC in the state also summoned a press conference to react and to say the figures could not have been true.\n\nNow, the thanksgiving services seem to get to tensions. The Wike camp seems to no longer be ready to accommodate constant revelations and taunting.\n\nThe Fubara camp has used the thanksgiving services to lament failures in the last administration; failure to employ, failure to promote workers, failure to pay pensions, failure to promote SMEs, industries, etc. Those who faced clampdowns or court cases seem to find voice now. They freely speak at thanksgiving services, and the Wike camp certainly don't look happy.\n\nWarning:\n\nNow, Amaewhule, the speaker whose position and those of his defected colleagues are under threat, has reacted. The fierce Wike loyalist has warned Fubara to call his supporters to order.\n\nAmaewhule, who spoke on behalf of the Grassroots Development Initiative (GDI), a group formed by Wike's loyalists, at the inauguration of the Nyesom Wike International Market, Omagwa, Rivers State, on Friday, April 26, 2024, accused Governor Fubara and his supporters of insulting Wike on various occasions, including during thanksgiving celebrations for Fubara's Supreme Court victory.\n\nThe peace pact reached between Fubara and his predecessor, the estranged political godfather, Wike, when President Bola Tinubu intervened in October 2023, collapsed due to the growing political unrest in the wealthy gas and crude oil state.\n\nDuring a media chat in Abuja on April 2, 2014, Wike ruled out any reconciliation in the foreseeable future with Fubara.\n\nFubara, on his part, broke his silence on April 3, 2024, as he promised to surprise his detractors if they dared him, referring to those stampeding him to implement all the items in the eight-point presidential proclamation.\n\nHowever, Amaewhule, said: \"You have been insulting your boss, the immediate past governor of the Rivers State. You have given him names and allowed riff-raffs to insult him on different occasions in your so-called thanksgiving for your Supreme Court victory.\"\n\nHe further emphasised that the Supreme Court victory belonged not only to Fubara but to all Rivers people, including those who worked to secure his position as governor.\n\n\"That Supreme Court victory is not only for you. The Supreme Court victory is for Rivers' people. We all worked for you, and the PDP, for you to be where you are today,\" he stated.\n\nAmaewhule warned that if the insults towards Wike and President Bola Tinubu continued, the Wike's loyalist group would retaliate.\n\n\"If you don't stop, if you don't stop, we will come after you. We are not afraid. We are not afraid. That Government House does not only belong to you, it belongs to Rivers' people,\" he said.\n\nThe GDI spokesperson also reminded Fubara of Wike's role in his ascension to power, saying, \"All of us fought for you to be there, and Wike fought for you to be there. So, if you want to continue to insult Wike, be prepared, you will run. You will run.\"\n\nAmaewhule further criticised Fubara's background, claiming he was merely a civil servant without the political experience and sacrifices made by others.\n\n\"You're just a civil servant, you're not a politician. You have not paid any price that we have paid in the past,\" he stated.\n\nAmaewhule further stated, \"From tomorrow, we will be observing your supporters, we will be observing your followers. Any further attempts to insult the president of Nigeria, to insult our grand patron, Chief Ezenwo Nyesom Wike, then be ready for war, and you will pay the price.\"\n\nEze fires back:\n\nA Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi loyalist and prolific writer, Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, has however, fired back, calling in security agencies to look into the threat. He described the statement as unruly, wayward, insensitive and sheer madness.\n\nEze, the erstwhile National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New People's Democratic Party (nPDP) and chieftain of the Amaechi camp of the APC, cautioned Amaewhule and others to; \"Relieve themselves of every burden of depraved inclinations propelling them to vulgarly abuse the exalted office of the Governor of Rivers State and accord some respect to the holder of the office, Fubara.\"\n\nHe said Fubara's peaceful disposition all along appears to be mistaken for ignorance.\n\nReacting to the comment credited to Amaewhule wherein he was quoted as saying Rivers' people should prepare for war, Eze said such cascade of uncanny vitriol qualifies the maker for an invitation from relevant security agencies for questioning. He called on the Police to quickly wade-in to deter other merchants of crime, adding that no one should be allowed the monopoly of threats and political violence in Rivers State or anywhere else.\n\nQuoting some of the passages from Amaewhule, Eze said it beats one's imagination that minions operating in the guise of politics would gather the guts to dish out threats to a sitting Governor in a public forum without recourse to the legal implication of their careless misadventure and its effects on their rights as citizens in a bid simply to impress one overzealous political boss.\n\nEze recalled Wike's statement on Fubara thus \"Fear those who don't talk too much and try to undermine Governor Fubara because of his stature and background because if he decides to come after you, your name is sorry\" and said he totally agreed with Wike on this. He warned those threatening Fubara to take it easy and don't provoke him to remember them because they may not find out easy.\n\nOn the continuous labelling of Gov Fubara as an ingrate for not submitting himself to be ruled from outside the state, Eze noted that the governor was on a just cause and owed loyalty to God, the people of the state, and the Nigerian Constitution; and not to any individual anywhere.\n\nEze contended that nobody was insulting Wike but that people were merely reproducing or restating what Wike says about himself and undemocratic actions.\n\nEze further stated that it was not in doubt the role Wike and his loyalists played in getting Fubara elected as the governor of Rivers State but to coerce the governor to govern the State according to their biddings is the most wicked act against Rivers State and her people and this remains unacceptable.\n\n\"People should not misunderstand Governor Fubara on the role he has chosen on how to govern the state because God in his love towards Rivers State and her people resolved to adopt Fubara as a tool to rescue the state from the hands of those who have kept the state in perpetual darkness for the past eight years or so.\n\n\"You can imagine the difference between the present IGR of N27billion to what was obtainable this past eight years. That is sheer wickedness.\"\n\nEze, again, called on President Tinubu not only to call Wike and his boys to order, but to order the IGP and other Security Agencies to ensure the arrest of anybody trying to foment trouble in Rivers State.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBoth camps have used thanksgiving church services and other events to throw stones at each other, whether it is thanksgiving or 'tauntsgiving'. They have also used press briefing to cast aspersions. There is no sign that this would come to an end soon as long as both Wike and Fubara have many favours to dish out to loyal followers. They will continue to dish out both thanks and taunts against each other because some Wike followers deliberately call the governor Sin instead of Sim.", "source": {"uri": "businessday.ng",

It is only for us to realize that. God will not come down from Heaven but will pass through one man or woman to achieve His purpose.\n\n\"So, for that reason, when we act, we act as humans; human vessels that God has used, and not seeing yourself as God.\n\n\"I want to say this clearly that we appreciate the role our leaders, most especially the immediate past governor, played. But that is not enough for me to worship a human being. I can't do that.\"\n\nHe maintained that he had acted like the big brother in the crisis, not interested in destroying the 'house', in order for meaningful development to continue in the State while securing tenable political relationship.\n\nFubara also said that it would have been out of the ordinary to engage in any political fight when there was so much work to be done for the State and its people as their Governor.\n\nHe said: \"But I know that I have always taken the path of peace. I have shown respect. I've subjected myself to every meeting of reconciliation for peace. And what happens, each time we come out from such meetings, we are faced with one thunder or lightning.\"\n\nThe governor pointed out that when he assumed office, it was with the resolve to build on the existing foundation of the development of past leaders, especially the immediate past governor.\n\nFubara stated: \"But it is a bad thing when the problem that ought not to be anything, becomes something, and in fact, gets out of the bedroom to the sitting room and to the compound. That is the case of Rivers State today.\n\n\"I am also happy that you even mentioned the issues, even when I have all the instruments of State powers. I have shown restrain, and I believe that whoever is alive and has been following the activities of our dear State, knows that I have acted as a big brother in the course of this crisis.\n\n\"I have not acted like a young man who may want the house to be destroyed but I have behaved like a mature young man that I am. This is because I know that no meaningful development will be achieved in an atmosphere of crisis.\n\n\"And because our intention for Rivers State is to build on the foundation that had been laid by our past leaders, it will be wrong for me to take the path of promoting crisis. That is why we are still recording the development that you are hearing around Rivers State.\"\n\nFubara faulted the Rt Hon. Martin Amaewhule-led group of lawmakers and declared that they do not exist anymore as lawmakers in the eyes of the law.\n\n\"Let me say it here, those groups of men who claim that they are assembly members, they are not existing. I want it to be on record.\n\n\"I accepted that peace accord to give them a floating (soft-landing). That's the truth. There is nothing in that peace accord that is a constitutional issue. It is a political solution to a problem. I accepted it because there were people that were visiting me and we were together in my house.\n\n\"These are people that I have helped... in many ways when I wasn't even a Governor. Yes, we might have our disagreements, but I believe that one day, we could also come together. That was the reason I did it.\n\n\"But I think it has gotten to a time when I need to make a statement on this thing so that they understand that they are not existing. Their existence and whatever they have been doing is because I allowed them to do so. If I don't recognize them, they are nowhere, that is the truth.\"\n\nHe added: \"So, I want you to see the sacrifice I have made to allow peace to be in our State. I can say here, with all amount of boldness, I have never called any policeman anywhere to go and harass anybody.\n\n\"I have never gone anywhere to ask anybody to do anything against anybody. But what happens to the people that are supporting me? They are being harassed, they are being arrested and detained. There is no week that somebody doesn't come here with one letter of invitation for trump-up charges and all those things.\n\n\"I am saying all these because of what my senior said here: restrain. I don't think the other party has shown any restraint. I am the one who has shown restraint in the face of this crisis.\n\n\"I am the one that is badly hit, even when I have all the government instruments to shake up the table. But, why will I do it? I believe that peace is the best relationship to cultivate.\"\n\nHe said, \"We were separated because of political purposes to expand development, but we need to be united so that the economies of these two states will grow.\n\n\"There is no need for us to have any argument over assets, there is no need for us to have a disagreement over the issue of who owns this or who doesn't own that.\n\n\"One way or the other, we are even inter-related. That is the truth. So, there is no need to fight.\"\n\nFubara noted that he took the initiative of going to see Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State because he wanted an end to the toxic relationship that existed in the past administrations.\n\n\"We had our meeting and by the grace of God, we've had a very wonderful relationship. He's always there watching out for me. Even in the face of this crisis, things my commissioner ought to do, when they hide the information from me, he calls me tell me.\n\n\"You don't know what I am going through. I am working with my own enemies. Imagine where your Attorney-General will go to sabotage you. It was as bad as that. But, they will get their reward.\n\n\"So, you see, if I had not gone to reconcile with my brother, I would have been in a bigger mess. So, I have already started benefiting, reaping the fruits of that peaceful relationship.\"\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and former governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Henry Seriake Dickson, said their visit was one of solidarity with the governor and Rivers people who have shown maturity in the face of the political crisis for stability and development to thrive.\n\nHe said: \"Your Excellency, we will agree that no true brother or even good neighbour can stay unconcerned when the house of a brother or neighbour is on fire or has an issue. Even if there is a small flame, a neighbour or a good brother should be concerned.\n\n\"We have come here as your brothers and as good neighbours also. But also in our own right as Rivers people because this State is our Mother State.\n\n\"And we are here to show support and solidarity with you, your Government, and most importantly, solidarize with the good people of this State.\n\n\"We have also come with a message Your Excellency, of peace and reconciliation, forgiveness, unity, mutual respect, political maturity and tolerance by all.\"", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "new_telegraph@newtelegraphng.com", "name": "New Telegraph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "emmanuel_masha@newtelegraphng.com", "name": "Emmanuel Masha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminalayi_Fubara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siminalayi Fubara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Seriake_Dickson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Seriake Dickson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Rivers_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Rivers State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House,_Sydney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government House, Sydney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribal chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayelsa_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douye_Diri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douye Diri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Wike-vs-Fubara.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540652", "eventUri": "eng-9540652", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

This is because I know that no meaningful development will be achieved in an atmosphere of crisis.\n\n\"And because our intention for Rivers State is to build on the foundation that had been laid by our past leaders, it will be wrong for me to take the path of promoting the crisis.

I believe that peace is the best relationship to cultivate.\"\n\nFubara thanked the delegation for coming to solidarise with him and his government, noting that\n\nRivers is incomplete without Bayelsa State and vice versa.\n\nHe said, \"We were separated because of political purposes to expand development, but we need to be united so that the economies of these two states will grow.\n\n\"There is no need for us to have any argument over assets, there is no need for us to have disagreement over issue of who owns this or who doesn't own that. One way or the other, we are even inter-related. That is the truth. So, there is no need for fight.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara said he took the initiative of going to see Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State because he wanted an end to the toxic relationship that existed in the past administrations.\n\nIn his remark earlier, leader of the delegation said the visit was one of solidarity with Fubara and Rivers people who have shown maturity in the face of the political crisis.\n\nHe said, \"Your Excellency, we will agree that no true brother or even good neighbour can stay unconcerned when the house of a brother or neighbour is on fire or have issue. Even if there is a small flame, a neighbour or a good brother should be concerned.\n\n\"We have come here as your brothers and as good neighbours also.

I have shown respect. I've subjected myself to every meeting of reconciliation for peace. And what happens, each time we come out from such meetings, we are faced with one thunder or lightening.\"\n\nThe Governor pointed out that when he assumed office, it was with the resolve to build on the existing foundation of development of past leaders, especially the immediate past governor.\n\nGovernor Fubara emphasised that it would have been out of the ordinary to engage in any political fight when there was so much work to be done for the State and its people as their Governor.\n\nHe said, he strongly felt that it was proper to set some records straight about what had become of a minor problem that was not uncommon in every human relationship.\n\nGovernor Fubara stated: \"But it is a bad thing when the problem that ought not to be anything, becomes something, and in fact, gets out of the bedroom to the sitting room and to the compound. That is the case of Rivers State today.\n\n\"I am also happy that you even mentioned the issues, even when I have all the instruments of State powers. I have shown restrain, and I believe that whoever is alive and have been following the activities of our dear State, knows that I have acted as a big brother in the course of this crisis.\n\n\"I have not acted like a young man that may want the house to be destroyed but I have behaved like a matured young man that I am. This is because I know that no meaningful development will be achieved in an atmosphere of crisis.\n\n\"And because our intention for Rivers State is to build on the foundation that had been laid by our past leaders, it will be wrong for me to take the path of promoting crisis. That is why we are still recording the development that you are hearing around Rivers State.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara insisted that there was nothing wrong in one helping another person but that does not mean the helper should take the place of God.\n\nThe Governor said, as long as he was concerned, God will remain God, who could sometimes cause one's enemy to be willing vessel to bring about one's promotion in life.\n\nHe said, \"God can do anything He wants to do when He wants to do it.

God will not come down from Heaven but will pass through one man or woman to achieve His purpose.\n\n\"So, for that reason, when we act, we act as humans; human vessels that God has used, and not seeing yourself as God.\n\n\"I want to say this clearly that we appreciate the role our leaders, most especially the immediate past governor, played. But that is not enough for me to worship a human being. I can't do that.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara took a swipe against the Rt Hon. Martin Amaewhule-led group of lawmakers, and declared that they do not exist anymore as lawmakers in the eyes of the law.\n\n\"Let me say it here, those group of men who claim that they are assembly members, they are not existing. I want it to be on record.\n\n\"I accepted that peace accord to give them a floating (soft-landing). That's the truth. There is nothing in that peace accord that is a constitutional issue. It is a political solution to a problem. I accepted it because these are people that were visiting me and we were together in my house.\n\n\"These are people that I have helped... in many ways when I wasn't even a Governor. Yes, we might have our disagreements, but I believe that one day, we could also come together. That was the reason I did it.\n\n\"But I think it has gotten to a time when I need to make a statement on this thing, so that they understand that they are not existing. Their existence and whatever they have been doing is because I allowed them to do so. If I don't recognize them, they are nowhere, that is the truth.\"\n\nThe Governor further said: \"So, I want you to see the sacrifice I have made to allow peace to be in our State. I can say here, with all amount of boldness, I have never called any police man anywhere to go and harass anybody.\n\n\"I have never gone anywhere to ask anybody to do anything against anybody. But what happens to the people that are supporting me? They are being harassed, they are being arrested and detained. There is no week that somebody doesn't come here with one letter of invitation for trump-up charges and all those things.\n\n\"I am saying all these because of what my senior said here: restrain. I don't think the other party has shown any restrain. I am the one that has shown restrain in the face of this crisis.\n\n\"I am the one that is badly hit, even when I have all the government instruments to shake up the table. But, why will I do it? I believe that peace is the best relationship to cultivate.\"\n\nSpeaking further, Governor Fubara thanked the delegation for coming to solidarise with him and his Government, and noted that\n\nthere is no complete Rivers State without Bayelsa State and vice versa, which demands that they continue to work together for development.\n\nHe said, \"We were separated because of political purposes to expand development, but we need to be united so that the economies of these two states will grow.\n\n\"There is no need for us to have any argument over assets, there is no need for us to have disagreement over issue of who owns this or who doesn't own that.\n\n\"One way or the other, we are even inter-related. That is the truth. So, there is no need for fight.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara said he took the initiative of going to see Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State because he wanted an end to the toxic relationship that existed in the past administrations.\n\n\"We had our meeting and by the grace of God, we've had a very wonderful relationship. He's always there watching out for me. Even in the face of this crisis, things my commissioner ought to do, when they hide the information from me, he calls me to tell me.\n\n\"You don't know what I am going through. I am working with my own enemies. Imagine where your Attorney-General will go to sabotage you. It was as bad as that. But, they will get their reward.\n\n\"So, you see, if I have not gone to reconcile with my brother, I would have been in bigger mess. So, I have already started benefiting, reaping the fruits of that peaceful relationship.\"\n\nGovernor Fubara also regretted that Rivers State was experiencing such protracted political crisis because there are no leaders of conscience who could stand up boldly and mediate on issues without bias.\n\nIn his remark earlier, leader of the delegation and former governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Henry Seriake Dickson, said their visit was one of solidarity with Governor Siminalayi Fubara and Rivers people who have shown maturity in the face of the political crisis for stability and development to thrive.\n\nHe said, \"Your Excellency, we will agree that no true brother or even good neighbour can stay unconcerned when the house of a brother or neighbour is on fire or have issue. Even if there is a small flame, a neighbour or a good brother should be concerned.\n\n\"We have come here as your brothers and as good neighbours also. But also in our own right as Rivers people because this State is our Mother State.\n\n\"And we are here to show support and solidarity with you, your Government, and most importantly, solidarize with the good people of this State.\n\n\"We have also come with a message Your Excellency, of peace and reconciliation, forgiveness, unity, mutual respect, political maturity and tolerance by all.\"\n\nHe added that if there is peace and development in Rivers State, the people of Bayelsa State will benefit, and if there is crisis in the State, his people will suffer as well, and called on all sides to give peace a chance.\n\nChief Press Secretary to the Rivers State Governor", "source": {"uri": "puoreports.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "PUO REPORTS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminalayi_Fubara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siminalayi Fubara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Seriake_Dickson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Seriake Dickson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Rivers_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Rivers State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House,_Sydney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government House, Sydney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Rivers_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Rivers State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribal chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayelsa_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douye_Diri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douye Diri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://puoreports.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FB_IMG_1715022847395.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540652", "eventUri": "eng-9540652", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 452726105, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 48, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 48}}}

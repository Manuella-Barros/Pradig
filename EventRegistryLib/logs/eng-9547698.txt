Jugo said during a media briefing on Tuesday.\n\nAlveo Land's first-quarter 2024 figure is also up by 41.1% compared with the P9 billion worth of reservation sales posted last year.\n\nThe residential condominium segment took up P7.5 billion in reservation sales, followed by residential lots at P3.8 billion, and office and commercial lots at P1.4 billion, Mr. Jugo said.\n\nAlveo Land's market operates in the price range of P13 million to P22 million. Alveo is a brand of the listed property developer Ayala Land, Inc. (ALI).\n\nAccording to Mr. Hugo, the growth was driven by the launches of horizontal developments such as the 41-hectare Sereneo Nuvali and the 28-hectare Caleia Vermosa.\n\nSereneo Nuvali recorded about P1.5 billion worth of reservation sales year to date since its launch in March. The property is the sixth Alveo Land project within ALI's Nuvali eco-estate in Laguna.\n\nIt offers residential lots with a typical size of 275 square meters (sq.m.).

Lot offerings in the village have a typical size of 250 sq.m.\n\nMr. Jugo added that Alveo Land's first-quarter performance was also boosted by its residential condominium developments: Park East Place in Bonifacio Global City (BGC), The Lattice at Parklinks, and Nuveo at Cerca along the Alabang-Las Pi\u00f1as corridor.\n\nPark East Place is a high-rise condominium project located in BGC and is near buildings and commercial centers.\n\nThe Lattice is situated along the borders of Pasig City and Quezon City, while Nuveo is the latest residential condo offering within the 6.6-hectare Cerca district.\n\nAlveo Land also benefited from its office developments such as Alveo Park Triangle Tower in BGC, as well as commercial lots in Centrala, Central Luzon, and Evo City South District in Kawit, Cavite.\n\nMr. Jugo said the company aims to expand its presence in areas such as Quezon City, Batangas, and Cavite.\n\n\"We continue to see growth potential in prime locations especially within ALI estates. Investors and end-users value and appreciate the unique benefits of investing and living in an Alveo property within these master planned estates,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the company is also focused on the premium segment of the real estate market due to its resilience against macroeconomic challenges such as high interest rates.\n\nOn Tuesday, ALI stocks fell by 1.12% or 30 centavos to P26.50 per share. -- Revin Mikhael D.

Caleia was also launched in March and offers 250-sqm lots.\n\nBoth Sereneo and Caleia offer lots for around P13 million to P22 million each, depending on the package.\n\nREAD: Where the location sells itself\n\nMeanwhile, residential condominium sales accounted for P7.5 billion of the total, driven by the stronger performance of three projects: Park East Place in Taguig City, The Lattice in Pasig City and Nuveo in Las Pi\u00f1as City.\n\nJugo said they expected to continue the upward trajectory this year, considering the record-high reservation sales for the quarter.\n\nThis year, Ayala Land plans to launch P100 billion worth of projects, with 80 percent of launches coming from its premium brands, including Alveo Land. -- Meg J.

Many high-end real estate were bought for the purpose of investment, which is why many appear to be idle. Many properties are also sold even before they're finished since deals are often better in pre-selling.\n\nWith the Philippine economy continuing to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the country's major property companies are seeing good earnings in the first quarter as many of the country's elite turn to premium condominiums and lots for investments, unaffected by high interest rates and inflation.\n\nAyala Land Incorporated's (ALI) upscale brand Alveo Land, for instance, saw record first quarter reservation sales this year of P12.7 billion, its highest first quarter sales in Alveo's history.\n\n\"It's a market that's fairly robust, really resilient, one that looks for places to invest, store value,\" Alveo Land President Mike Jugo said in a press briefing on Tuesday, May 7. The price range in Alveo's high-end subdivisions and condominiums is between P13 million to P22 million.\n\nJugo attributed Alveo's record reservation sales in the first three months of 2024 to two new subdivision projects south of the capital, one in Laguna province and another in Cavite province, as well as condominium projects in Metro Manila such as in Bonifacio Global City, Pasig City, and Quezon City.\n\nIn Laguna, Alveo had P1.5 billion in reservation sales from its 41-hectare Sereneo Nuvali, its sixth subdivision project launched last March in Ayala's upscale Nuvali eco-estate. He noted though that many of their lot buyers are also end-users who are attracted to the greenery and recreational facilities such as Sereneo's 770-square-meter swimming pool, which he said will be the largest among the villages in Nuvali.\n\nSereneo Nuvali is a 41-hectare project that has 415 lots with a typical size of 275 square meters and a centrally located park. The price of each property is around P15 million.\n\nIt's almost the same price in Alveo's Caleia Vermosa, Alveo's second subdivision also launched last March in lifestyle estate Vermosa, Cavite. Caleia has 540 lots with a typical size of 250 square meters and a centrally located park. Alveo's reservation sales from this 28-hectare project reached P2 billion in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nIn Alveo's residential condominiums, the biggest contributors to the company's first quarter record sales were projects in Bonifacio Global City or BGC (P2 billion); Makati (P1.5 billion); Quezon City (P1.4 billion); Alabang-Las Pi\u00f1as corridor (P1 billion); and Pasig-Ortigas (P800 million).\n\nJugo cited three condominium projects with \"strong take-up\" - Park East Place in BGC; The Lattice at Parklinks Estate in Pasig City; and Nuveo condominium in the 6.6-hectare Cerca district in the Alabang-Las Pi\u00f1as corridor.\n\nHigh-rise condominium Park East Place near S&R and St. Luke's Medical Center in BGC is Alveo's \"fastest-selling\" condominium project, the company said. The current selling price is P450,000 per square meter or around P27 million for a 61-square-meter, one-bedroom unit.\n\nJugo said he's seeing a similar picture that he saw before the pandemic when he would have almost weekly meetings with clients who are either investors or end-users. In his conversations with them, he said many of them talked about family and portfolio [investments], and it's the same interests again this year.\n\nHowever, he believes the focus on these two is even keener this time \"because of the pandemic.\"\n\nJugo said many of their buyers are confident that the value of their property will appreciate.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the Philippines had a \"house price boom\" from 2010 to 2018, with house prices in Commercial Business Districts rising by as much as 125% or by 77% when adjusted with inflation, according to Global Property Guide.\n\nIn a disclosure on Wednesday, May 7, Alveo's parent company, Ayala Land Incorporated (ALI), reported that its net income grew 39% to P6.3 billion in the first quarter while revenues were up 33% to P41 billion.\n\n\"Property development revenues increased by 47% to P25 billion, driven by robust residential and commercial lot bookings. Residential revenues surged by 51% to P21.4 billion, and revenues from commercial and industrial lots jumped 59% to P2.8 billion,\" ALI said.\n\nBillionaire Andrew Tan's Megaworld Corporation similarly reported high sales in the first quarter of 2024. The Philippines' leading township developer said its net income rose by 10% to P5 billion, while revenues grew by 16% to almost P19 billion.\n\n\"Real estate sales surged by 29% to P12.1-billion, driven by strong bookings and unit sales, while leasing revenues grew 6% to P4.6-billion during the quarter compared to the same period last year,\" Megaworld said on Thursday, May 9.\n\nMegaworld has 31 townships and lifestyle estates nationwide. In the Philippine capital, among its well-known projects are Eastwood City in Libis, Quezon City; ArcoVia City in Pasig City; Newport City in Pasay City; Uptown Bonifacio in BGC; and Lucky Chinatown in Binondo, Manila.\n\nThe Gokongweis' Robinsons Land Corporation (RLC) reported last week or on May 3 that its first quarter consolidated EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization] was an \"all-time high of P6.15 billion, marking the highest quarterly figure in our history.\"\n\nRLC said its property development portfolio generated P3.13-billion in revenues in the first quarter, a year-on-year growth of 25%, \"driven by higher revenue recognition from RLC Residences and earnings from equity shares in Joint Venture projects.\"\n\nRLC reported a P4-billion profit in the first quarter, while revenues went up 19% to P11 billion. It also declared a cash dividend of P0.65 per share, the highest in the company's history.\n\nThe Sy family's SM Prime Holdings Incorporated, among the biggest integrated property developers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, reported \"steady growth\" in the first quarter of 2023 with net income hitting P10 billion, 11% higher than the P9.4 billion in the first quarter last year.\n\nIt also recorded high reservation sales in its residential business in the first quarter at P26.5 billion.\n\nHistorically, SM Prime's mall business accounts for bulk of the company's earnings. This year is no different, contributing 59% of the company's revenues with P18 billion in the first quarter.\n\nRevenues from residential business reached P8.5 billion, 10% higher than the P7.7 billion in 2023. Residential accounted for 28% of SM Prime's revenues.\n\nShang Properties Incorporated, which owns prime properties mostly in Mandaluyong City and Makati City, reported on Thursday P858 million in revenues from condominium sales in the first quarter of 2024, up from P675 million in the same period the year prior. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It was an experiment that started off very well, but crashed and burned quickly, marred by game plans that doomed their defense, and personnel moves that left fans without answers.\n\nTwo of the most head-scratching moves Kelly made during his time as Eagles head coach were dumping DeSean Jackson and LeSean McCoy in back-to-back offseasons. Jackson was released in 2014, McCoy traded to Buffalo in 2015. Both moves drew outrage from Eagles fans.\n\nThe two former Eagles teammates recently started a podcast, called The 25/10 Show - McCoy and Jackson's jersey numbers while with the Eagles.\n\nYou figured it was only a matter of time before the subject of Chip Kelly - and their mutual distaste for his personality and methods - came up. It did on Thursday in an episode entitled \"The Truth About Chip Kelly.\"\n\nBoth players said their personalities clashed with Kelly early on his tenure. They bristled at his \"there are no starters\" mantra at the start of his first mini-camp in 2013. Jackson had been to two Pro Bowls; McCoy was first-team All-Pro in 2011.\n\nThey also agreed that Kelly would rarely, if ever, directly address issues with veteran players. Instead, he would delegate any hard messages to his lower assistants, or \"runners\" as they called them.\n\n\"He never really approached me, and was never a disciplinarian,\" said Jackson on Kelly. \"He would talk to me, and it was like he was scared of me... I respect certain coaches, and when you get my respect, I will run through a brick wall for you... that's the love that you build with a coach. With Chip Kelly, I never felt that love, because he always was scared of me. How can I respect you if I feel like you're scared of me? You never voice your opinion with me, you always ran around it.\"\n\nMcCoy presented an opinion he had on Kelly that the coach treated Black players differently from white players.\n\n\"I never had a coach who was scared - not even scared - I'll say uncomfortable around Black players,\" McCoy said about Kelly. \"Let's not hide it, right? Most of the players are black. The NFL is dominated by Black players.\"\n\nHe presented a story about a Black teammate, cornerback Roc Carmichael, who wore his hair long. McCoy said Kelly told Carmichael to \"be more presentable.\"\n\nMcCoy went on to share his experience following an incident where his teammate, wide receiver Riley Cooper, used a racial slur at a Black security guard at a June 2013 concert. Cooper was fined by the team and agreed to undergo sensitivity training. McCoy believed that after Cooper apologized to the team, Kelly kept Cooper away from the NovaCare Complex for several days to avoid any incidents.\n\n\"I had a good relationship with Coop,\" McCoy said. \"Ain't no way he's racist... but I wanted to talk to him. Chip made it so nobody could even speak to him, no one could even talk to him. And I'm thinking like, 'How does that even happen? You say all this and that, and you just say 'sorry' and you leave and not ever talk about it? [Kelly] hid that whole thing from us.\"\n\nWhen Kelly was hired, he was also given full personnel control. Howie Roseman, who had been the general manager of the team for the previous three seasons, was not only defanged by Kelly, he was also sent to a different office, far away from any other football operations personnel.\n\nWith all that power to make player moves, virtually unchecked, the first Kelly transaction that began his undoing was the release of Jackson, after a Pro Bowl season where Jackson set career highs in catches (82) and receiving yards (1,332).\n\nHours before Jackson's release in the spring of 2014, a report claimed that the Eagles had concerns about his issues off the field, citing possible ties with Los Angeles gangs. Jackson has frequently denied the gang allegations.\n\n\"Drew [Rosenhaus, Jackson's agent] is telling me, 'They're releasing you because of this [article],'\" Jackson said. \"I wasn't a convicted felon, I've never been to jail, I have a clean slate on everything I've done. I'm like, 'Wow, they're really fin'na release me on this, bro?' So they end up release me, and they're antagonizing me, bro. They're saying I'm a thug, I'm a hoodlum, I'm not a good teammate.\"\n\nAs for McCoy, after two straight Pro Bowl seasons with Kelly, was traded to the Bills for linebacker Kiko Alonso. McCoy thought he was being pranked.\n\n\"[McCoy's agent] Drew Rosenhaus called me. He said 'Shady, this is not a joke.' I was in Miami training. That's the first thing he says to me. He didn't even say hello! 'Shady, this is not a joke, the Eagles are trading you to the Buffalo Bills,'\" McCoy remembered.\n\nI said, 'Hey, stop playing, man. What you want, man?' He said, 'I'm not playing, Shady. They're trading you.' I'm like, 'They're trading me?'\n\nMcCoy also claimed that Kelly nearly traded defensive end Brandon Graham, but the move was vetoed by owner Jeffrey Lurie.\n\nKelly also let wide receiver Jeremy Maclin walk following that 2014 season, after Maclin led the team in catches (85) and receiving yards (1,318).", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"},

After a stint as UCLA's head coach, Kelly is currently the offensive coordinator at Ohio State.\n\nMcCoy and Jackson also said he 'singlehandedly dismantled' what could have been a great team in Philadelphia due to his coaching philosophies.\n\nKelly coached the Eagles for three seasons before one year leading the 49ers in the NFL\n\n'I never had a coach that was uncomfortable when dealing with black players because, lets just not hide it, most of the players are black.

'And it was weird because you were uncomfortable.'\n\nJackson and McCoy spent the entire 54-minute episode detailing their problems with Kelly's time as the Eagles' head coach, bringing up numerous examples of his alleged bad decisions.\n\nOne example was how Kelly allegedly did not want players listening to music in the locker room or driving to games themselves instead of a team bus.\n\nKelly also allegedly would not criticize black players directly, letting one of his assistant coaches handle those duties.\n\nJackson was cut by the Eagles in 2013 after one season with Chip Kelly leading

look more 'presentable'.\n\nMcCoy also claimed former team quarterback Michael Vick said he cried more while playing under Kelly than he did during his 21 months in prison.\n\nKelly also favored Oregon alumni over other players who did not play for the Ducks, such as when McCoy was traded for Kiko Alonso, who played under Kelly in Eugene for four years.\n\nBoth Jackson and McCoy also took issue with how Kelly allegedly handled former teammate Riley Cooper saying the n-word in public, where he decided to put the wide receiver on leave and not address his teammates for weeks after the

Howie Roseman, who had been the general manager of the team for the previous three seasons, was not only defanged by Kelly, he was also sent to a different office, far away from any other football operations personnel.\n\nWith all that power to make player moves, virtually unchecked, the first Kelly transaction that began his undoing was the release of Jackson, after a Pro Bowl season where Jackson set career highs in catches (82) and receiving yards (1,332).\n\nHours before Jackson's release in the spring of 2014, a report claimed that the Eagles had concerns about his issues off the field, citing possible ties with Los Angeles gangs. Jackson has frequently denied the gang allegations.\n\n\"Drew [Rosenhaus, Jackson's agent] is telling me, 'They're releasing you because of this [article],'\" Jackson said. \"I wasn't a convicted felon, I've never been to jail, I have a clean slate on everything I've done. I'm like, 'Wow, they're really fin'na release me on this, bro?' So they end up release me, and they're antagonizing me, bro. They're saying I'm a thug, I'm a hoodlum, I'm not a good teammate.\"\n\nAs for McCoy, after two straight Pro Bowl seasons with Kelly, was traded to the Bills for linebacker Kiko Alonso. McCoy thought he was being pranked.\n\n\"[McCoy's agent] Drew Rosenhaus called me. He said 'Shady, this is not a joke.' I was in Miami training. That's the first thing he says to me. He didn't even say hello! 'Shady, this is not a joke, the Eagles are trading you to the Buffalo Bills,'\" McCoy remembered.\n\nI said, 'Hey, stop playing, man. What you want, man?' He said, 'I'm not playing, Shady. They're trading you.' I'm like, 'They're trading me?'\n\nMcCoy also claimed that Kelly nearly traded defensive end Brandon Graham, but the move was vetoed by owner Jeffrey Lurie.\n\nKelly also let wide receiver Jeremy Maclin walk following that 2014 season, after Maclin led the team in catches (85) and receiving yards (1,318).", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsphiladelphia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports

He then carried over some of that success to the NFL for his first couple seasons as Philadelphia Eagles head coach. Alas, an alienating/abrasive personality, an ill-advised power grab to have final say over all personnel/roster decisions, and decline in on-field results led to Kelly wearing out his welcome fast in Philly.\n\nOn the heels of a middling tenure at UCLA, Kelly is now the offensive coordinator at Ohio State, with the chance to perhaps weasel his way back into the NFL. If what retired Eagles stars DeSean Jackson and LeSean McCoy had to say about Kelly on their The 25/10 Show podcast has any influence, the market for Kelly outside of Columbus might be a little chilly.\n\nWhile it's possible that Kelly has evolved since getting fired by the Eagles back in 2015, followed by an awful 2-14 2016 campaign with the San Francisco 49ers, he doesn't strike me as a guy who's terribly self-aware, never mind self-critical. Whether Kelly continues on with this sort of jerk behavior or not, McCoy and Jackson were eager to sound off on just how bad things got when they played for him.\n\nTo kick things off in the first of multiple noteworthy segments, check out how Jackson describes his unceremonious departure in 2014 from the only NFL team he'd played for to that point in his career.\n\nIt's wild that Jackson was cut right after the Eagles posted consecutive 10-win seasons on the basis of something that had nothing to do with his personal conduct, and turned out to be a big nothing burger.\n\nWould the average outsider say Chip Kelly is racist based solely on that situation involving Jackson? Perhaps. Another former Eagle the The 25/10 Show spoke with, Roc Carmichael, had some even more damning testimony about his experience with Kelly.\n\nIf you don't take anything that Jackson, McCoy or Carmichael say about Kelly at face value, how about several other respected veterans who chimed in? Stud left tackle Jason Peters, longtime cornerstone defensive end Brandon Graham, and dynamic wideout Jeremy Maclin had nothing kind to say about their ex-coach.\n\nDuring a promo that mixes in some bits from the clips already featured herein, McCoy talks about how Kelly didn't trade him to Buffalo for the betterment of the Eagles' team, but rather, Kelly sent him there \"to die.\"\n\nI don't think I've ever seen any players come out this hard, this publicly against a former coach of theirs in the history of sports. Has there ever been anything quite like this? I can't recall.\n\nGood thing Kelly is old chums with Buckeyes head coach Ryan Day. There's no way he'll be on the chopping block at Ohio State in spite of this embarrassing dress down. Kelly will have to follow Day wherever he goes as an assistant.\n\nGiven how much of a disaster he was as a de facto GM for the Eagles -- Howie Roseman must've been coming out of his skull at the time -- his horrendous one-year stint with the 49ers, and how hated he his by former NFL players, the best Kelly can likely do is an OC job beneath Day at the collegiate level. That, or a second-tier NCAA head coaching gig. Can't imagine an NFL team letting Kelly into their building after this.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeSean_McCoy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeSean McCoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chip Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_offense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spread offense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeSean_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeSean Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_Carmichael", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roc Carmichael"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Roseman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howie Roseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Maclin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Maclin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Deasean-Jackson.png?fit=957%2C567&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554313", "eventUri": "eng-9554313", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

He told a story about one of his teammates, Roc Carmichael, who the head coach allegedly told to cut his long hair to \"be more presentable.\"\n\nThe six-time Pro Bowl running back also did not appreciate how Kelly handled an incident with Riley Cooper. McCoy's teammate used a racial slur at a Black security guard at a concert in 2012.\n\nCooper was fined by the team, apologized, and underwent sensitivity training. Kelly reputedly kept him away from the Eagles' building for many days there after in an effort to avoid additional problems.\n\nI had a good relationship with Coop. Ain't no way he's racist... but I wanted to talk to him.\n\nChip made it so nobody could even speak to him, no one could even talk to him. And I'm thinking like, \"How does that even happen? You say all this and that, you just say 'sorry' and you leave and not ever talk about it? [Kelly] hid that whole thing from us.\n\nJackson also spoke about how their head coach would rarely, if ever, address any problems with veteran players. He said that Kelly would delegate any difficult conversations to his assistants.\n\nHe never really approached me, and was never a disciplinarian. He would talk to me, and it was like he was scared of me... I respect certain coaches, and when you get my respect, I will run through a brick wall for you... that's the love that you build with a coach. With Chip Kelly, I never felt that love, because he always was scared of me. How can I respect you if I feel like you're scared of me?

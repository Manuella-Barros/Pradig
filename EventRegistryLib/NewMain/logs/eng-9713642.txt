The new rule dictates that once that time is reached and then the leader crosses the start-finish line, there are two laps remaining.\n\nDrivers after the race indicated they were OK with the procedure.\n\n\"The good thing about it was at least we all sort of knew what the process and procedure was this time, where last time that was what took us out of having a shot at winning the race because we pitted and then they shortened the race and all the guys that didn't pit kept the track position and made it to the end,\" McDowell said.\n\nBob Pockrass covers NASCAR for FOX Sports.

The new rule dictates that once that time is reached and then the leader crosses the start-finish line, there are two laps remaining.\n\nDrivers after the race indicated they were OK with the procedure.\n\n\"The good thing about it was at least we all sort of knew what the process and procedure was this time, where last time that was what took us out of having a shot at winning the race because we pitted and then they shortened the race and all the guys that didn't pit kept the track position and made it to the end,\" McDowell said.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_pockrass@foxnews.com", "name": "Bob Pockrass", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_slick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racing slick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_(Chicago)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park (Chicago)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Gibbs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Gibbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Hand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joey Hand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Briscoe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chase Briscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_van_Gisbergen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane van Gisbergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McDowell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael McDowell (racing driver)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1024/512/bow1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

He won the race on wet weather tires no less. However, the NASCAR driver had an apology to make after crossing the finish line.\n\nDuring his victory interview, Alex Bowman offered up an olive branch to Bubba Wallace the the No. 23 team. Bowman turned Wallace around in Stage 2 and more or less put an end to their day, at least being competitive.\n\nWith how major this win is for Bowman and his team, it's a good look on him to apologize first and foremost. Then again, Bubba got a little revenge on the cool-down lap.\n\n\"Man, I don't know, any time you got to the race track with Hendrick Motorsports you got a shot,\" Bowman said. \"First off, like we talked earlier, I have to apologize again to the 23 guys. Just messed up, and trying to get my windshield wiper on, missed a corner and ruined their day. So, I hate that I'm embarrassed about it but we have a trophy to take home and I know it means a lot to this team. They put me in position to win the race.\"\n\nThen Alex Bowman talked about what the win means for him. He has big party plans in store for tonight.\n\n\"Man, I broke my back. I had a brain injury, and we've kinda sucked ever since. I didn't, you start to second guess if you're going to get a chance to win a race again. Last one we won we didn't really get to celebrate... We're going to drink so much damn bourbon tonight. It's going to be a bad deal. I'm probably going to wake up naked on the bathroom floor again, but that's just part of this deal sometimes.\n\n\"Thanks to Ally and everybody at Hendrick Motorsports. Everybody that makes this deal go round. Mr. H and Jeff [Gordon]. Shoutout to Chloe at home, she's at home with the pups. This is like the only race she's missed all year, so, I'm sure she's pissed off at me for that one. But she's sitting at home with Huck. Yeah, excited to get home it's going to be a good night.\"\n\nAlex Bowman won this race on bold strategy. Wet weather tires held up in the end. Tyler Reddick made a convincing charge on slick tires. However, Reddick was unable to catch Bowman in the end. A mistake on the last lap sealed the fate of the 45 and 48 cars.\n\nIt stinks for Bubba Wallace and his team. They had a top-10 car to start this race. It probably stings more because Bowman was the next closest driver to Wallace in points in the playoff battle.

He is the 12th Cup Series driver to win this year, leaving four remaining spots in the playoffs with six races left in the regular season.\n\nAfter his Vegas victory two years ago, Bowman, 31, was sidelined by a concussion.

When Bowman crossed the start-finish line after that time, the white flag came out, followed by the checkered.\n\nReddick made a late charge, but he got into a wall while trying to run down Bowman.

A clean lap was all I had to do and couldn't even do that.\"\n\nBowman closed it out on wet weather tires in his Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet after pole-sitter Kyle Larson and Shane van Gisbergen were knocked out.\n\nDuring the cool-down lap, Bowman was bumped into the wall by Bubba Wallace. Bowman spun out Wallace early in the race.\n\n\"I have to apologize again to the 23 guys,\" Bowman said. \"Just messed up, trying to get my windshield wiper on, missed a corner and ruined their day. I hate that. I'm still embarrassed about it.\"\n\nLarson slammed into the tire barrier in Turn 6 on Lap 34, bringing out a caution. He was trying for his fourth win of the season in his 350th career Cup Series start.\n\n\"As soon as I hit the brakes, I knew I was in trouble,\" said Larson, who has an 11-point lead over Chase Elliott in the driver standings.\n\nVan Gisbergen was clipped by Chase Briscoe going into Turn 6 on Lap 25. Briscoe slid into a tire barrier, but van Gisbergen crashed into the temporary wall -- causing heavy damage to the right side of his Kaulig Racing Chevrolet.\n\n\"I just sort of turned in. It looked pretty good and then just got smacked by someone,\" van Gisbergen said. \"It's gutting.\"\n\nShortly after the wreck, the race was stopped to give NASCAR time to clear standing water from the makeshift track. The drivers returned to their cars about an hour later, but the delay continued when another cell passed over the course.\n\nGibbs was in front when the race resumed, followed by Christopher Bell and Larson.\n\n\"It's really fun. I feel like it's kind of like a dirt track, honestly,\" Gibbs said about the wet conditions. \"Pick and choose your lines, see what lane is drying up and is faster. You have to look around, which makes it fun as we don't get to do that a lot.\"\n\nVan Gisbergen raced to a career-altering victory last year in Chicago when he became the first driver to win his Cup Series debut since Johnny Rutherford in the second qualifying race at Daytona in 1963. The 35-year-old New Zealand native also won Saturday's Xfinity Series race on the tricky 12-turn, 2.2-mile course.\n\nVan Gisbergen won the first stage Sunday shortly before he was knocked out.\n\n\"We were able to lead and I felt like I was driving well with it,\" he said, \"so yeah, it's a shame to be out so early. It's a shame we couldn't have a proper crack at it at the end.\"\n\nBowman's victory finished NASCAR's second year on the street course in Chicago. It is expected to return next season, but the future of the weekend -- a combination of racing and music that is designed more for NASCAR newcomers than its traditional fans -- is unclear beyond 2025.\n\nUnlike last year, when persistent showers wreaked havoc on the schedule -- leading to shortened versions of the Xfinity and Cup Series races -- there was no issue with the weather until the Cup drivers got into their cars and got the command to start their engines. Then the rain started to fall, and the teams had to make a quick decision on whether to switch to wet tires.\n\nAfter slowing to a drizzle, the showers increased in intensity about 17 laps in -- eventually leading to the stoppage.\n\nUp next\n\nThe Cup Series is at Pocono next Sunday.\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com",

The time limit meant the race still fell short of the planned 75 laps.\n\nBowman was in the lead at the moment 8:20 p.m. CT struck.

His triumph not only was his first in 80 races, but also punches his ticket into the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs. He also completed a fascinating feat, as he won the final race at Chicagoland Speedway in 2019 for his first career victory in the Cup Series.\n\nThe race was an eventful one, with some of the favorites to win, including returning champion Shane van Gisbergen and Kyle Larson, falling out due to crashes.\n\nRacers navigated some wet conditions at the start, with the rainy weather posing an interesting challenge for drivers and crews as they were forced to decide which tires to use for the race. Rain initially only began in some parts of the course while other portions remained dry, but as the race went on, the wet weather worsened.\n\nOne driver described the conditions as \"sudsy\" while puddles were visible along the course.\n\nWith numerous crashes reported, a red flag was waved during Lap 26 as crews worked to remove puddles from the course. But just after 7 p.m., cars began moving onto the track once again -- this time on a countdown.\n\nVan Gisbergen, Larson, Christopher Bell and Ty Gibbs held the leads for much of the race, but crashes and pit stops paved the way for a new group of racers to take the lead.\n\nWith minutes left to spare, Alex Bowman, Joey Hand and Brad Keslowski were the front runners.

In 32 career Cup Series starts on this track type, he'd led just five laps; in the rain-filled edition of Chicago's race last season, he crashed out and finished 37th.\n\nThis year? He left the streets by Lake Michigan an unlikely race winner.\n\nBowman and crew chief Blake Harris took advantage of another dose of wet weather, one that ultimately turned Sunday's second edition of this street race into a timed event. Staying out during a stage break, he jumped toward the front, gambling track position would run out the clock against faster cars who switched to faster, slick tires on drying asphalt.\n\n\"As those cautions kept coming,\" Harris explained. \"We got to that stage [break] and it was like, wait a second, we have like eight, ten laps here to go. . Like there's a chance [to win if we stay out]. If there's a caution or two, there's a chance.\"\n\nThat's exactly what happened, one late yellow draining the time Bowman needed after passing road course ringer Joey Hand to take the lead. Just enough slower cars got in the way of fast-closing Tyler Reddick, who cleared traffic and had to get overaggressive to have any chance. When Reddick hit the wall on the final lap giving chase, it was the extra bit Bowman needed to trudge toward an upset win as darkness fell.\n\nConsider the circumstances for Bowman heading in, boasting longshot odds of 60/1 according to Sportsline. He hadn't won since Las Vegas in March 2022, a span of nearly 2 \u00bd years. Since then, he's suffered through two serious injuries (concussion, back) and entered this weekend leading just six laps in all of 2024.\n\nOn Sunday, he was out front for the final eight, raising eyebrows and popping a balloon of speculation that swells whenever you underperform at Hendrick Motorsports, the most successful team in NASCAR history.\n\n\"At some point,\" HMS Vice Chairman Jeff Gordon admitted, \"You've got to win. Not just because you're at Hendrick Motorsports, it's because it's really hard to get the team where they need to be to compete at the highest level on a regular basis.\"\n\nBowman heard the noise, only growing louder after the demise of Stewart-Haas Racing sparked a stronger burst of Silly Season activity than usual. A contract extension through 2026 failed to quiet doubters as they watched Bowman's three teammates all secure playoff-clinching wins with ease.\n\n\"As a human being,\" Bowman said, \"I'm just a dude trying to do my job the best I possibly can, and I see everything that gets said about me. So to be able to overcome what I've gone through and to end up back here, it feels really good.\"\n\nWith the win, Bowman arguably becomes the third driver to secure a long-term future that hung in the balance. Daniel Suarez bought time at Trackhouse with his February win at Atlanta Motor Speedway, ensuring he'll be one of three drivers kept on for 2025. Austin Cindric, despite a contract similar to Bowman, appeared destined for the exits at Team Penske before teammate Ryan Blaney ran out of gas at Gateway, handing him the win.\n\nIt's created a trio of wild cards with monkeys off their backs and nothing to lose entering the playoffs. And in a year that started with a select group of drivers ahead of the pack, it's nice to see a little bit of unpredictability into this year's postseason field.\n\nTraffic Report\n\nGreen: Joey Hand. Joey who? The sports car veteran had an uneventful career as a NASCAR road course ringer before nearly pulling off the type of upset Shane van Gisbergen did last year. In the end, Hand couldn't keep up with Bowman on similar strategy, but a fourth-place finish is nothing to sneeze at for a driver in a part-time third car for RFK Racing.\n\nYellow: Tyler Reddick. Second, indeed, is the first loser for a driver who's given up a shot at victories so close he could taste them for two straight weeks. Top-five finishes are meaningless for someone who long ago clinched a spot in the playoffs; instead, he missed out on precious bonus points. \"We were catching Alex by a large margin there, and ... I clearly just screwed up,\" Reddick said. \"Trying to stay in the dry groove and... I cut the wheel a little too hard.\"\n\nRed: Christopher Bell. How many times this year has Bell been the fastest car only to find himself wrecked out of the race? This time, it was a tangle with teammate Martin Truex Jr. that left the No. 20 Toyota sitting out after leading 14 laps. Bell's now crashed out five times this season, tying a career high with 16 races still to go.\n\nSpeeding Ticket: Shane van Gisbergen and Kyle Larson. SVG entered Sunday the overwhelming pre-race favorite to go back-to-back on the street course. Larson, the pole sitter, was his biggest rival, the two staging a remarkable duel in Saturday's NASCAR Xfinity Series race before SVG came out on top.\n\nWho would have guessed they'd end Sunday's race as the first two cars who failed to finish?\n\nSVG went first, an innocent victim when Chase Briscoe lost control in front of his No. 16 Chevrolet.\n\nLarson joined SVG inside the garage moments later, locking up the brakes on a wet track and slamming head-on into Turn 6 in the day's hardest wreck.\n\nOops!\n\nBowman's win was slightly overshadowed by early contact with Bubba Wallace that ruined a top-10 run for a No. 23 Toyota team fighting for their playoff lives.\n\nWallace still staged a valiant comeback, climbing to 13th by the checkered flag but was fuming in the cockpit most of the day with a driver he's got a history with. Wallace took time to express displeasure to Bowman after the race, hitting the No. 48 Chevrolet with Bowman's window net down in a move that will likely produce at minimum a hefty NASCAR fine.\n\nCount Bowman among those who doesn't believe Wallace should be seriously penalized. The first thing he did upon exiting his race car was apologize before celebrating the victory.\n\n\"Just messed up,\" Bowman explained. \"Trying to get my windshield wiper on, missed a corner and ruined their day. I hate that. I'm still embarrassed about it.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_bowles@cbssports.com", "name": "Tom Bowles", "type":

Wallace ended up finishing in 13 place, while Bowman snapped an 80-race winless drought with his triumph.\n\nBut after Bowman's win, something unexpected happened.\n\nAs the cars approached Turn 12 on the circuit during the cooldown lap and were preparing to turn onto Columbus Drive, Wallace pulled up alongside Bowman's vehicle and hit the door of the car with his front-left tire, a maneuver known as \"door slamming.\"\n\nBowman went on to address the situation in victory lane.\n\n\"I just messed up and was trying to get my windshield wiper on and missed a corner and ruined their whole day. I hate that and I'm still embarrassed by that,\" Bowman said.\n\nAfter the initial interview, Bowman reportedly continued to defend Wallace, telling reporter Nate Ryan he doesn't think Wallace should be penalized for the post-race hit.\n\n\"He barely hit me, everything was fine and it was plenty deserved,\" Bowman said.\n\nHe also noted that he reached out to Wallace with an apology during a rain delay mid-race.\n\nBowman had not won a race since 2022, and his triumph not only was his first in 80 races, but also punches his ticket into the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs. He also completed a fascinating feat, as he won the final race at Chicagoland Speedway in 2019 for his first career victory in the Cup Series.\n\n\"We have a trophy to take home and I know it means a lot to this team,\" Bowman said. \"They put me in position to win the race. And man, I broke my back, had a brain injury and we've kind of sucked ever since.

That's just part of this deal sometimes.\"\n\nBowman ended his 80-race winless skid when he held on for a victory Sunday evening in the Hendrick Motorsports No. 28 Chevrolet on the rain-soaked streets of downtown Chicago.\n\nIt was Bowman's first victory since a March 2022 triumph at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and No. 8 for the 31-year-old Arizona native's Cup Series career. He is the 12th driver to win a Cup Series points race this year, leaving just four spots in the 16-driver field for the playoffs with six races left in the regular season.\n\nAfter his victory two years ago in Las Vegas, Bowman was sidelined by a concussion. In April 2023, he injured his back in a crash on a short track while moonlighting in a sprint car.\n\n\"You start to second-guess if you're ever going to get a chance to win a race again,\" he said.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nThe race was stopped for more than 100 minutes because of rain, and NASCAR set a cutoff of 8:20 p.m. local time because of the fading sunlight. When Bowman crossed the start-finish line after that time, the white flag came out, followed by the checkered.\n\nTyler Reddick made a late push, but he got into a wall in the 23XI Racing No. 45 Toyota while trying to catch up to Bowman and wound up second.\n\n\"I got the opportunity to run him down,\" Reddick said. \"Just obviously couldn't get the job done. A clean lap was all I had to do, and couldn't even do that.\"\n\nTy Gibbs was third in the Joe Gibbs Racing No. 54 Toyota, followed by Joey Hand in the RFK Racing No. 60 Ford and Michael McDowell in the No. 34 Ford for Front Row Motorsports.\n\nBowman, who had started Sunday's race eighth, closed out the victory on wet-weather tires after Hendrick teammate Kyle Larson, who had started in pole position, and Shane van Gisbergen, who started fifth for Kaulig Racing, were knocked out.\n\nDuring the cooldown lap, Bowman was bumped into the wall by 23XI Racing's Bubba Wallace. Bowman spun out Wallace's No. 23 Toyota early in the race.\n\n\"I have to apologize again to the 23 guys,\" Bowman said. \"Just messed up, trying to get my windshield wiper on, missed a corner and ruined their day. I hate that. I'm still embarrassed about it.\"\n\nAP photo by Erin Hooley / NASCAR drivers Denny Hamlin, left, and Chris Buescher round the sixth turn of the temporary street circuit during Sunday's Cup Series race in Chicago.\n\nLarson slammed into the tire barrier in the circuit's sixth turn on the 34th lap, bringing out a caution. He was trying for his fourth win of the season in his 350th career Cup Series start.\n\n\"As soon as I hit the brakes, I knew I was in trouble,\" said Larson, who was on top of the season points standings going into the weekend.\n\nVan Gisbergen had been clipped by Stewart-Haas Racing's Chase Briscoe going into the same turn nine laps earlier. Briscoe slid into a tire barrier, but van Gisbergen crashed into the temporary wall, causing heavy damage to the right side of his Chevrolet.\n\n\"I just sort of turned in. It looked pretty good, and then just got smacked by someone,\" van Gisbergen said. \"It's gutting.\"\n\nShortly after the wreck, the race was stopped to give NASCAR time to clear standing water from the temporary course. The drivers returned to their cars about an hour later, but the delay continued when another storm cell passed over the course.\n\nGibbs was in front when the race resumed, followed by JGR teammate Christopher Bell and Hendrick's Larson.\n\n\"It's really fun. I feel like it's kind of like a dirt track, honestly,\" Gibbs said of the wet conditions. \"Pick and choose your lines, see what lane is drying up and is faster. You have to look around, which makes it fun as we don't get to do that a lot.\"\n\nVan Gisbergen raced to a career-altering victory last year in Chicago when he became the first driver to win his Cup Series debut since Johnny Rutherford in the second qualifying race at Daytona International Speedway in 1963. The 35-year-old New Zealand native also won Saturday's second-tier Xfinity Series race on the tricky 12-turn, 2.2-mile course.\n\nVan Gisbergen won the first stage Sunday shortly before he was knocked out. Last year's Chicago race was the first for the Cup Series on a street circuit.\n\n\"We were able to lead, and I felt like I was driving well with it,\" van Gisbergen said of Sunday's race. \"So, yeah, it's a shame to be out so early. It's a shame we couldn't have a proper crack at it at the end.\"\n\nNASCAR is expected to return to Chicago next season, but the future of the weekend -- a combination of racing and music that is designed more for stock car racing newcomers than its traditional fans -- is unclear beyond 2025.\n\nUnlike last year, when persistent showers wreaked havoc on the schedule -- leading to shortened versions of both the Xfinity Series and Cup Series races -- there was no trouble with the weather until the Cup Series drivers got into their cars and got the command to start their engines Sunday. Then the rain started to fall, and the teams had to make a quick decision on whether to switch to wet tires.\n\nAfter slowing to a drizzle, the showers increased in intensity about 17 laps in, eventually leading to the stoppage.\n\nThe Cup Series will race the next two Sunday -- on July 14 at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, and on July 21 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway -- before a two-week break for the Paris Olympics because of NBC Sports coverage. Then comes the four-race home stretch toward the 10-race playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "timesfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesfreepress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And a spot in the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs.\n\n\"We're going to drink so much damn bourbon tonight, it's going to be a bad deal,\" a jubilant Bowman said. \"I'm probably going to wake up naked on the bathroom floor again. That's just part of this deal sometimes.\"\n\nBowman held off Tyler Reddick on a rainy street course in downtown Chicago on Sunday, stopping an 80-race winless drought.\n\nIt was his first victory since Las Vegas in March 2022 and No. 8 for his career. He is the 12th Cup Series driver to win this year, leaving four remaining spots in the playoffs with six races left in the regular season.\n\nAfter his Vegas victory two years ago, Bowman, 31, was sidelined by a concussion. He injured his back in a short-track accident in April 2023.\n\n\"You start to second-guess if you're ever going to get a chance to win a race again,\" he said.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nThe Cup Series' second street race in Chicago was stopped for more than 100 minutes because of rain, and NASCAR set a cutoff time of 8:20 p.m. CDT because of the fading sunlight. When Bowman crossed the start-finish line after that time, the white flag came out, followed by the checkered.\n\nTyler Reddick made a late charge, but he got into a wall while trying to run down Bowman. Ty Gibbs was third, followed by Joey Hand and Michael McDowell.\n\n\"I got the opportunity to run him down,\" Reddick said. \"Just obviously couldn't get the job done. A clean lap was all I had to do and couldn't even do that.\"\n\nBowman closed it out on wet weather tires in his Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet after pole-sitter Kyle Larson and Shane van Gisbergen were knocked out.\n\nDuring the cool-down lap, Bowman was bumped into the wall by Bubba Wallace. Bowman spun out Wallace early in the race.\n\n\"I have to apologize again to the 23 guys,\" Bowman said. \"Just messed up, trying to get my windshield wiper on, missed a corner and ruined their day. I hate that. I'm still embarrassed about it.\"\n\nLarson slammed into the tire barrier in Turn 6 on Lap 34, bringing out a caution. He was trying for his fourth win of the season in his 350th career Cup Series start.\n\n\"As soon as I hit the brakes, I knew I was in trouble,\" said Larson, who has an 11-point lead over Chase Elliott in the driver standings.\n\nVan Gisbergen was clipped by Chase Briscoe going into Turn 6 on Lap 25. Briscoe slid into a tire barrier, but van Gisbergen crashed into the temporary wall -- causing heavy damage to the right side of his Kaulig Racing Chevrolet.\n\n\"I just sort of turned in. It looked pretty good and then just got smacked by someone,\" van Gisbergen said. \"It's gutting.\"\n\nShortly after the wreck, the race was stopped to give NASCAR time to clear standing water from the makeshift track. The drivers returned to their cars about an hour later, but the delay continued when another cell passed over the course.\n\nGibbs was in front when the race resumed, followed by Christopher Bell and Larson.\n\nVan Gisbergen raced to a career-altering victory last year in Chicago when he became the first driver to win his Cup Series debut since Johnny Rutherford in the second qualifying race at Daytona in 1963. The 35-year-old New Zealand native also won Saturday's Xfinity Series race on the tricky 12-turn, 2.2-mile course.\n\nVan Gisbergen won the first stage Sunday shortly before he was knocked out.\n\n\"We were able to lead and I felt like I was driving well with it,\" he said, \"so yeah, it's a shame to be out so early. It's a shame we couldn't have a proper crack at it at the end.\"\n\nBowman's victory finished NASCAR's second year on the street course in Chicago. It is expected to return next season, but the future of the weekend -- a combination of racing and music that is designed more for NASCAR newcomers than its traditional fans -- is unclear beyond 2025.\n\nUnlike last year, when persistent showers wreaked havoc on the schedule -- leading to shortened versions of the Xfinity and Cup Series races -- there was no issue with the weather until the Cup drivers got into their cars and got the command to start their engines. Then the rain started to fall, and the teams had to make a quick decision on whether to switch to wet tires.\n\nAfter slowing to a drizzle, the showers increased in intensity about 17 laps in -- eventually leading to the stoppage.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But for the drivers, the conditions didn't take away from the excitement of the race.\n\nThe Grant Park 165 concluded after Alex Bowman accomplished something he'd never done before: Bowman won his first road course Sunday evening.\n\nBowman, who raced in the No. 48 Chevrolet, celebrated his victory with a crash into the wall as he clinched a spot in the playoffs and ended his 80-race drought. Bowman's decision to stick with the rain tires played a role in his victory.\n\nLast April, Bowman was involved in a car crash in Iowa that left him with a fractured vertebra. He initially thought the injury would be career-ending, but he rehabbed his way back. Bowman noted the mental side of struggling was tougher than the physical.\n\n\"It's really difficult,\" Bowman said. \"Obviously, we have all the tools we need to win and our teammates have been really good throughout that time, but we couldn't put it together.\"\n\nOn the final lap, Tyler Reddick, who finished second, had an opportunity to pass Bowman until he hit the wall, and time became an issue.\n\n\"I would have gotten there,\" Reddick said. \"What would have happened once I got there, who knows?\n\n\"There was still more braking potential, just more grip potential there at the very end. I think I would have gotten there. He would have fought really hard, but unfortunately, we'll never know.\"\n\nBowman was able to win partly because he stuck with the rain tires instead of switching and getting laps behind. He also hadn't ran any wet laps all year.\n\nThat decision gave Bowman a healthy cushion, which led to his victory. He outlasted Tyler Reddick in the No. 45 car and Joey Hand in the No. 60 car. Hand's decision to stick with rain tires paid off.\n\nBowman said he and his team will drink so much bourbon tonight to celebrate the win. This win was emotional for him and his team, but not for any individual race. The emotions flowing are because of what Bowman had to overcome to make it to the Chicago Street Race.\n\n\"It's certainly been a large mental task to go through everything that has happened in the last two years and try to continue to overcome that each and every week,\" Bowman said.\n\nHeavy rain once again played a huge role in the Grant Park 165. However, the drivers still enjoy the experience of driving a street course and the overall environment.\n\nFor the second straight year, NASCAR wasn't able to finish the full 75 laps for 165 miles. Because of the lost time, NASCAR announced that the race would end at 8:20 p.m. once the leader crossed the start-finish line after the time expired.\n\nBowman and his crew's decision to stick with the rain tires even as the weather dried up wasn't an easy one, but they felt comfortable with the choice. For other drivers, the decision was costly.\n\n\"It buried us and then we ended up losing a lap,\" said Michael McDowell, who finished fifth.\n\nEven after the restarts and delays, the drivers still enjoyed racing in Chicago. The weather added another element of stress, but that didn't damper the moment for the drivers.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that we've -- for a couple of years now -- ended up with rain,\" Hand said. \"But the couple days with the concerts -- the people out in the sunshine -- it gives a really good vibe.\"\n\nThe Chicago Street Race is entering the last year of its contract, but all the drivers have continued to sing the praises of the city.\n\n\"It's an incredible event,\" Bowman said. \"It's been two chaotic races with the weather, but it's been a super fun event and really meaningful to be able to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_tyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rain tyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vertebra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_absorber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shock absorber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_(Chicago)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park (Chicago)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Hand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joey Hand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McDowell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael McDowell (racing driver)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/80d10ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F6b%2Fdf62620b45ac938b1f001c6faa38%2Fnascar2-070724-98.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The time limit meant the race still fell short of the planned 75 laps.\n\nBowman was in the lead at the moment 8:20 p.m. CT struck. With that, the white flag was waved, followed by the coveted checkered flag.\n\nBowman, who broke an 80-race win drought and marked his first street race win, notably won the last NASCAR Cup Series race at Chicagoland Speedway.\n\n\"We have a trophy to take home and I know it means a lot to this team,\" Bowman said. \"They put me in position to win the race. And man, I broke my back, had a brain injury and we've kind of sucked ever since. And you start to second guess if you're ever going to get a chance to win a race again and last one, we won.\"\n\nThe race was an eventful one, with some of the favorites to win, including returning champion Shane van Gisbergen and Kyle Larson, falling out due to crashes.\n\nRacers navigated some wet conditions at the start, with the rainy weather posing an interesting challenge for drivers and crews as they were forced to decide which tires to use for the race. Rain initially only began in some parts of the course while other portions remained dry, but as the race went on, the wet weather worsened.\n\nOne driver described the conditions as \"sudsy\" while puddles were visible along the course.\n\nWith numerous crashes reported, a red flag was waved during Lap 26 as crews worked to remove puddles from the course. But just after 7 p.m., cars began moving onto the track once again -- this time on a countdown.\n\nVan Gisbergen, Larson, Christopher Bell and Ty Gibbs held the leads for much of the race, but crashes and pit stops paved the way for a new group of racers to take the lead.\n\nWith minutes left to spare, Alex Bowman, Joey Hand and Brad Keslowski were the front runners.

Trying to stay in the dry groove, and I had more than enough of dry groove, as I'm seeing right behind you. I cut the wheel a little too hard.\n\n\"Just not focused enough.

Van Gisbergen was crashed out of the race when Chase Briscoe broke traction and spun into the defending winner. Kyle Larson broke traction and drove right into a tire barrier.\n\nChristopher Bell, who dominated this race on pace for the second year in a row, found himself and crew chief Adam Stevens facing a potential no-win strategic scenario before getting crashed trying to make his way through the field.\n\nAnd for the race itself, NASCAR's holistic vision of what the event was supposed to look like, was not entirely realized ... even if it was closer than the inaugural running.\n\nPerhaps, the third time will be the charm in 2025, as it's not entirely off the table that NASCAR gives the Windy City festival concept one more go.\n\nOn Saturday, the weekend had taken on a SVG vs Kyle Larson vibe, albeit one with poised to feature cameos from Ty Gibbs, Tyler Reddick and Christopher Bell.\n\nThat part materialized pretty quickly with Van Gisbergen winning the first stage on a damp Grant Park ahead of Bell, Gibbs, Chase Briscoe, Larson and Bowman. But then came the rain, and a lot of it, precipitating a near two-hour rain delay.\n\nSVG got wiped out when Briscoe crashed into him on Lap 25.\n\n\"I just sort of turned in; it looked pretty good and then just got smacked by someone,\" van Gisbergen said. \"It's gutting. ... We were in the lead for a lot of that race. I felt good taking off in the rain, so that sucks. It's an unfortunate mistake by him. I'm sure he didn't mean it. But yeah, when he just clipped me, there wasn't anything I could do.\"\n\nLarson drove firewall deep into the Turn 6 tire barrier on Lap 34.\n\n\"I think all of us were getting a little more confident and confident in breaking,\" Larson said. \"I just went to the brakes a little deeper in each lap. At that time, as soon as I touched the break, I knew I was in trouble.\n\nThe rain further complicated matters as NASCAR was forced to shorten the race from 75 laps to whatever number came by 8:20 p.m. locally. It was complicated because the stage break came at a time where a dry line was starting to form on the track.\n\nSome teams in the middle of the pack chose to pit before the stage break, a matter of securing track position, and that forced the leaders to do the same.\n\nThe challenge for the likes of Bell, Gibbs and Reddick is that they would all have to start behind drivers like Hand and Bowman, who had nothing to lose in staying out.\n\nBowman got around Hand on the restart and held off Reddick, due in part, to catching another caution for a Josh Berry crash.\n\nReddick had a shot, on slicks, to catch Bowman but clipped the Turn 5 wall and it prevented him car from making real speed after that.\n\n\"I would have gotten there,\" Reddick said. \"What would have happened once I got there, who knows. The plaza, Turn 8 to Turn 12, that part of the racetrack hadn't been my best all weekend. But certainly we would have gotten really, really close, and it seemed like even on the dries kind of out of the driest lane, there was still more braking potential, just more grip potential there at the very end, even if you were kind of in some of the damp track.\n\n\"I think I would have gotten there. He would have fought really hard. But unfortunately we'll never know.\"\n\nFor Bell and crew chief Adam Stevens, there was never a consideration of staying out on the wet weather tires.\n\n\"We had to jump it because everybody could have come at the stage and you'd be behind them all,\" Stevens said. \"So we saw a bunch of them pit with three to go right. And that kind of forced our hand with two to go being the leader.\n\n\"We really felt like you were going to have to have slicks to win the race. The two things that hurt us were that caution, that that cut down laps, green flag laps for us to run. And obviously if the whole race runs under caution, which was a possibility, then you're not going to win. And if it runs green, we're probably going to win.\n\n\"Even if we got through that little skirmish there without wrecking our suspension, we were clearly ahead of (Reddick) and (Gibbs) so we needed two things to go wrong to not win and they both went wrong.\"\n\nConversely, Bowman's crew chief, Blake Harris had way more to gain in staying out than whatever points they might have lost if it didn't go well.\n\n\"At the end there once I knew I had his confidence of understanding like 'hey, man, we're going to have to go to the back and (Bell) is here, and how many cars are you going to pass in eight, nine laps,' and he was like, 'man, that's what we've got to do because I'm smoked in here,' but he knew where his tires were at.\n\n\"He knew the pace that he was running and I kind of tried to lay out what I was seeing and what I thought was going to happen, and really especially with that caution -- even without that caution, I knew we were going to have three laps maybe before those guys would really get some pace up on us if it strung out.\n\n\"So that really only left three, four laps of potential green based on the time limit. Really, yeah, it was an easy decision. If he thought his stuff was smoked, we probably had to have a conversation about where we were going to be, but all those buffer cars just played out perfect, and I think his confidence of knowing he could go get (Joey Hand) and get some space put on him, that was all of it, because I think it was going to be down to the last two or three corners if (Reddick) hadn't gotten in the fence.\n\n\"We needed every bit of it, every straightaway that he had, pull over cooling the tires as he's at speed trying to keep those things to temp. I don't know that he could have executed any better.\"\n\nBowman spun Bubba Wallace on Lap 25, roughly at the same time that Briscoe wiped out Van Gisbergen, and despite the best efforts from the former, the latter next let it go.\n\nWallace door slammed Bowman after the race, after Bowman dropped his window net, and NASCAR said it would investigate that incident in determining if punitive actions would be necessary.\n\nBowman said he doesn't blame Wallace for being angry.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd do that, too,\" Bowman said. \"I ruined his day. We had a really -- the restart was chaotic. I just made every wrong decision I possibly could, and I was fighting with my windshield wiper switch trying to get the thing working and I couldn't get it working and I was focused on that, missed the corner and cleaned him out. I locked all four tires up and slid right into him. I just messed up and absolutely ruined his day.\n\n\"I'm pretty hard on myself when I make mistakes like that, and I've been embarrassed about it since it happened.\"\n\nBowman even tried to make it right with Wallace during the rain delay after it happened.\n\n\"The rain delay was just a lot of me sitting there being embarrassed and being mad at myself,\" Bowman said.\"He has every right to be mad; I'd be mad, too. I tried to call him during the rain delay and I shot him a text. Nothing I can do to make it better, and I'm sure us winning probably only makes it worse.\"\n\nBowman says he doesn't want NASCAR to penalize Wallace.\n\n\"No, he barely hit me,\" Wallace said. \"It was fine, and it was plenty deserved.\"\n\nUnlike last year, NASCAR and the City of Chicago got the concerts and Xfinity Series race in but the Cup Series race was once again besieged by torrential rainfall.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson seemed enthusiastic about the event on Sunday.\n\nPrior to the weekend, NASCAR's Ben Kennedy said 'it's likely we're back in Chicago next year' too.\n\nLong term, the point of this event is to showcase to potential future host cities what a combined NASCAR race and music festival could offer as a commercial for a downtown and also the economic impact such an event could provide.\n\nThrough two attempts, NASCAR has almost painted that full picture, and the deal with The Windy City was always three years with built-in opt outs. The rain the past two years has been awfully unfortunate but there's also a proof of concept that appears to have a lot of merit for NASCAR and other cities to explore in the years to come as well.\n\nMatt Weaver is a Motorsports Insider for Sportsnaut.

Bowman got a good jump on the restart, then held off a fast-approaching Tyler Reddick - on new slick tires - by 2.863 seconds to earn his first win of the 2024 season and lock himself into the playoffs.\n\nBowman's most recent win came on March 6, 2022, at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and now all four Hendrick Motorsports drivers have qualified for the 16-driver playoff field.\n\nTwo of the top contenders for the win on Sunday saw their days end early.\n\nThree-time Supercars champion Shane van Gisbergen - who won this race a year ago - wrecked out on lap 25. Kyle Larson, who started on the pole, wrecked out on lap 34.\n\nThe start of Sunday's race was briefly delayed by a protestor - holding a \"Free Palestine\" sign - climbing the fence in Turn 3 and handcuffing himself to the fence before he was removed by police.\n\nDuring the hold, light rain moved into the area and NASCAR allowed teams to choose whether to start the race on wet weather tires before the start.\n\nAfter a back-and-forth battle with Christophe Bell, van Gisbergen emerged the leader and clinched the Stage 1 win when a caution was displayed with three laps remaining for an accident involving Corey LaJoie. Bell ended up second, Gibbs third, Chase Briscoe fourth and Larson fifth.\n\nFollowing a nearly one hour, 45-mite rain delay, Hand inherited the lead when most of the lead lap cars elected to pit before the break and held off Bowman by 0.131 seconds to take the Stage 2 win. Keselowski was third, Carson Hocevar fourth and Martin Truex Jr. rounded out the top five.\n\nOn lap 25 while the field was racing in the rain, Bowman spun out Bubba Wallace in Turn 2 and then in Turn 6, Briscoe locked up his brakes entering Turn 6 and slid wildly into the tire barriers, hitting last year's race winner, van Gisbergen, in the process.\n\nVan Gisbergen hit the wall after the impact with Briscoe but the damage to van Gisbergen's No. 16 Chevrolet was too extensive for him to continue.\n\nFollowing the break between Stages 2 and 3, a handful of cars elected to pit for slick tires, but Hand remained on the track and in the lead.\n\nNASCAR had earlier in the race set 8:20 p.m. Local time as the end of the race due to impending darkness, which left about 16 minutes remaining when the race resumed on lap 49.\n\nBy lap 50, Bowman had closed to the rear bumper of Hand as the pair separated themselves from most of the field while dueling for the lead.\n\nOn lap 51, Bowman worked his way around Hand to grab the lead for the first time in the race just before a caution was displayed for Josh Berry slamming into the tire barriers in Turn 2.\n\nThe race resumed with about five minutes remaining and Bowman out front of Hand, Keselowski and Truex.", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Hand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Hand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Briscoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chase Briscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_LaJoie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corey LaJoie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_van_Gisbergen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane van Gisbergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Briscoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Briscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercars_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercars Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Hocevar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carson Hocevar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Truex_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Truex Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn-4.motorsport.com/images/amp/6l9bwam0/s6/alex-bowman-hendrick-motorspor.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

While Kyle Larson, William Byron and Chase Elliott have been regularly competing for wins, Bowman was wondering what he had to do to get back to a race-winning level.\n\nPerhaps the floodgates will open for Bowman now, as he utilized an impressive drive to get the win in Chicago. Afterwards, while speaking with the media, the No. 48 wheelman fired back at critics who openly wondered whether he was worthy of his seat.\n\n\"Man, let me tell you about how great NASCAR is to us drivers. I got to my hotel room, there's a little box with my name on it, that had a bottle of bourbon in it, so that's in my bag. I'm pretty excited about that,\" Bowman explained, following the race. \"But I've got a couple bottles, that were bought early in 2022, that were like, 'The next win, we're going to drink these,' and they've been sitting on the counter way too f -- ing long.\n\n\"So yeah, everybody that said I couldn't win and don't deserve to be at Hendrick Motorsports and all that bulls -- , cheers to you.\"\n\nAs you can tell, the critics were on Bowman's mind following the Chicago Street Race, and it felt sweet for the No. 48 wheelman to prove them all wrong. Now that he's locked into the playoffs, the summer will be all about racking up points and preparing for a shot at the NASCAR Cup Series title in 2024.\n\nIt's evident a huge weight was lifted off Alex Bowman's shoulders in Chicago, and now he can race free over the next couple of weeks, leading into the playoffs. He's been consistent all season long, so more trips to Victory Lane could be in store for the No. 48 moving forward.\n\nMeanwhile, tempers flared after the Grant Park 165 in Chicago on Sunday when Bubba Wallace intentionally slammed into winner Alex Bowman during a cool-down lap, but Bowman was apologetic after the incident.\n\nIn fact, he's even advocating that NASCAR not punish Wallace for dooring him. According to Jeff Gluck of The Athletic, Bowman was firm on that point late Sunday evening, not wanting Wallace to face disciplinary measures for the post-race actions.\n\n\"He barely hit me, everything was fine and it was plenty deserved,\" Bowman said.\n\nThe winning driver also explained that he had already taken some steps to try to smooth things over with Bubba Wallace after earlier spinning him out in during Stage 1. That was what Wallace was almost certainly heated about after the race.\n\n\"I'd be mad, too. I ruined his day,\" Bowman said. \"I just messed up. I've been embarrassed about it since it happened. I tried to call him during the rain delay and I shot him a text.\"\n\nAs for his advocacy, Bowman will have to wait to see if NASCAR takes heed. Bubba Wallace will also be waiting, likely on pins and needles.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_samra@on3.com", "name": "Steve Samra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byron_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Byron (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gluck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gluck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_(Chicago)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park (Chicago)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/08073749/Alex-Bowman.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It's the second consecutive year that the event was plagued by rain.\n\nReddick's No. 45 Toyota Camry was closing in on Bowman's No. 48 Chevrolet Camaro heading into the final few laps. But Reddick clipped the wall on the final lap, which derailed his momentum toward catching Bowman. Reddick finished second, while Joe Gibbs Racing's Ty Gibbs was third.\n\nBowman sounded more than ready to celebrate during his post-race interview.\n\n\"We're going to drink so much damn bourbon tonight,\" said Bowman. \"It's going to be a bad deal.

His bump came just after Bowman had unhooked his window netting and raised his visor to wipe some sweat from his brow, jarring Bowman and leaving him stunned.\n\nThere had been prior history between the two during the race, of course. Bowman had previously spun Wallace and caused him to lose a ton of track positioning, effectively ruining his day.\n\nFor that, Bowman apologized after the race.\n\n\"I'd be mad, too. I ruined his day,\" Bowman said. \"I just messed up. I've been embarrassed about it since it happened. I tried to call him during the rain delay and I shot him a text.\"\n\nBowman even advocated for NASCAR not to penalize Wallace as a result of the dooring post-race.\n\n\"He barely hit me, everything was fine and it was plenty deserved,\" Bowman said.\n\nOf course, NASCAR has to take into account multiple factors when meting out discipline, and it took such actions on Wednesday.

In fact, the race didn't even go the distance due to weather, but Alex Bowman came out as the winner of the Grant Park 165 at the Chicago Street Course last weekend.\n\nOf course, after the win, Bowman said that he was going to \"drink so much damn bourbon\" and probably \"wake up naked on the bathroom floor.\"\n\nDid that indeed happen?\n\n\"I'm kind of impressed with myself, honestly. I've certainly grown up a little bit in the last couple years. I woke up in my bed like a normal human, made it to my meetings this morning. Everything's good,\" Bowman told host Kevin Harvick on Monday's edition of \"Kevin Harvick's Happy Hour.\" \"I'm not too bad off. I got like an hour and a half of sleep, so we're here.\"\n\nBowman added that Weller Antique 107 is his go-to bourbon.\n\nAs for the win in Chicago, Bowman led eight laps in a race that was delayed due to weather and then forced to be cut short after 58 laps due to daylight. The win provided Bowman with a sense of relief, as it was his first victory since March 6, 2022, when he won the Pennzoil 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and also locked him into the playoffs.\n\n\"Definitely a lot of pressure; my teammates have been super successful in the last couple years. For, whatever reason, we've definitely struggled a little bit, so [it] just felt really good to be able to get back in victory lane, finally win at a road course, which I feel like my road course stuff has continued to improve, and now I can go to most of the road courses and be pretty confident,\" Bowman said. \"I'm really appreciative of everybody sticking with me through some hard times, and [it] meant a lot to get back in victory lane.\"\n\nThe win was Bowman's eighth of his NASCAR Cup Series career and second in the city of Chicago, as his first win on the NASCAR circuit came in the Camping World 400 at Chicagoland Speedway in 2019.\n\nThis season, Bowman is 11th in total points (553), with five top-five finishes and 11 top-10 finishes.\n\nBowman, 31, is in his seventh full-time season with Hendrick Motorsports. He previously had stints at BK Racing (2014) and Tommy Baldwin Racing (2015).\n\nDespite the needed win, Bowman is keeping his eye on the prize.\n\n\"I think getting that win helps for sure, but we can't just be like 'okay, we won a race, now we can just focus on the playoffs'. I think we need to focus on each week and not kind of drop the intensity that we've had,\" Bowman said. \"I think our team's in a good spot. We've got a lot of young guys, and we've grown a lot as a team, which has been really fun to be a part of. ...\n\n\"I feel like we have every tool we need and all the parts and pieces we need to make that happen. Excited to be back in it. Last year was not very fun watching from where I sat, so hopefully we can make a lot of noise in the playoffs, and it'll be a good year.\"\n\nNext up for Bowman and the field is The Great American Getaway 400 this Sunday at Pocono Raceway, where Bowman got a win in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harvick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Street_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Street Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennzoil_400_(Las_Vegas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennzoil 400 (Las Vegas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping_World_400", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camping World 400"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK_Racing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BK Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicagoland_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicagoland Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Baldwin_Racing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Baldwin Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pocono Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1408/814/bowman1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He is the 12th Cup Series driver to win this year, leaving four remaining spots in the playoffs with six races left in the regular season.\n\nAfter his Vegas victory two years ago, Bowman, 31, was sidelined by a concussion.

When Bowman crossed the start-finish line after that time, the white flag came out, followed by the checkered.\n\nReddick made a late charge, but he got into a wall while trying to run down Bowman.

I'm still embarrassed about it.\"\n\nLarson slammed into the tire barrier in Turn 6 on Lap 34, bringing out a caution.

The most obvious being he is now locked in the 2024 playoffs and no longer the only Hendrick driver without a win.\n\n\"It's not been a lot of fun. We won four races in '21. We won right off the bat in '22. Then we had a rough summer in '22 and then we got back rolling and then I got hurt and we started '23 really fast and I got hurt again,\" Bowman said after the race.\n\n\"Yeah, it's really difficult. Obviously, we have all the tools we need to win, and our teammates have been really good throughout that time. But we just couldn't put it together.\n\n\"Honestly, the last month has been super frustrating for us. We've had a lot of things outside of our control, cost us a lot of points, and it's been really frustrating.\"\n\nWhile without a win, Bowman had been as high as eighth in the series standings as recently as the end of May, and in a solid position to make the playoffs based on points.\n\nHowever, with one finish better than 14th since, he had lost considerable ground entering last weekend's race.\n\nThat scenario is now irrelevant, and Bowman and his team can focus on putting themselves in the best position possible for when the playoffs begin.\n\nBowman's more temporary victory on Sunday was on his detractors, who always seem question his longevity at Hendrick because he doesn't own championships like teammates Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson or the wins of teammate William Byron.\n\nDuring his more than two-year winless drought, Bowman has also suffered a back injury from a wreck while driving a sprint car and suffered a concussion in an accident in a Cup race.\n\n\"I think you need to win races if you're at HMS. But certainly, nobody has made me feel like I'm on the hot seat,\" said Bowman, who has a contract that goes through the 2026 season.\n\n\"There's never been a single conversation with a single person that has questioned anything to do with that at all. It's always been, 'What do you need? How can we help you? How can we support the team?'\n\n\"That's the great part about Hendrick Motorsports is whatever the noise is outside, everybody inside is never going to tear each other down. They're always going to be supportive.\"\n\nFor one week - or maybe just a few days - Bowman has conquered the noise.\n\nHendrick Motorsports drivers will now make up one-fourth of the 16-driver playoff field and Bowman has the shortest current winless streak of any driver in the series (zero).\n\nBut that certainly won't last.

Feeling as if he had let everyone down, it was a tough moment.\n\nThat was just last year, and it seemed like a long time ago Sunday night.\n\nBowman is a NASCAR Cup Series winner once again after he held off Tyler Reddick in a shortened Grant Park 165 on a rainy street course in downtown Chicago. It was his first victory since March 2022 in Las Vegas, stopping an 80-race drought.\n\n\"There\u00b4s a lot of emotions that go away with this because of how hard that has been,\" Bowman said.\n\nWith his eighth career Cup Series win, Bowman became the last of the four Hendrick Motorsports drivers to secure a playoff spot. He is the 12th Cup driver to win this year, leaving four remaining slots in the playoffs with six races left in the regular season.\n\nIt also was the first Cup win for Blake Harris, who took over as Bowman's crew chief before the 2023 season.\n\nAlex Bowman gets out of his car after winning a NASCAR Cup Series auto race, Sunday, July 7, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Erin Hooley)\n\nBowman has 11 top-10 finishes this year, but his winless drought had ramped up speculation about his future at Hendrick. That all seemed to go away this weekend.\n\n\"I understand why people want to talk. ... It\u00b4s a tough business,\" said NASCAR Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon, a Hendrick executive. \"When you\u00b4re at Hendrick Motorsports, you do expect, especially when the other three have won, to be in that same category, and it hasn\u00b4t been happening. Hopefully this dispels a lot of the rumors.\"\n\nBowman's contract with Hendrick runs through the 2026 season. He made it clear that he felt the speculation about his future was overblown, but he definitely heard the talk.\n\n\"I think you need to win races whenever you\u00b4re at HMS,\" he said. \"But certainly nobody has made me feel like I\u00b4m on the hot seat. There\u00b4s never been a single conversation with a single person that has questioned anything to do with that at all. It\u00b4s all been, what do you need, how can we help you, how can we support the team.\"\n\nBowman is in his seventh full season at Hendrick. He got his first Cup Series victory at Chicagoland Speedway in 2019. The Arizona native won again at Fontana in 2020, and then earned a career-best four wins during a breakout performance in 2021.\n\nBut everything changed after he won at Las Vegas in March 2022. That same year, he was sidelined for five races after he sustained a concussion in a crash at Texas Motor Speedway. Then he had the back injury last year that kept him out for three points races and the All-Star festivities.\n\n\"The concussion and then to straight away go break my back after recovering from that and then to just tremendously struggle through last year and kind of lose our way a little bit, it was really difficult,\" he said.\n\nComing into Chicago, there was no sign that Bowman's drought was about to end. He had an engine issue at New Hampshire that ended his day on the 144th of 305 laps. He finished 14th at Nashville Superspeedway last weekend.\n\n\"I think the speed has been there,\" Harris said. \"We talked, we had an engine failure at Loudon and we had an engine failure here last year at Chicago. As we talk through those things, he\u00b4s like, man, right as we\u00b4re in this point battle, and I\u00b4m like, we\u00b4re one race away from that not mattering.\"\n\nThat one race was Sunday, and now Bowman and Harris can take a closer look at what they might do in the playoffs.\n\n\"I think race car drivers, they come up and they have accidents and sometimes you have injuries,\" Gordon said, \"and you find out how tough you are mentally and physically and how bad you want to do it. Alex has been through a few significant injuries, and he\u00b4s come back I feel like stronger each time.\"\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing\n\nAlex Bowman stands with his team and his trophy after winning a NASCAR Cup Series auto race, Sunday, July 7, 2024, in Chicago.

In the end, Reddic settled for a runner-up finish.\n\nTy Gibbs led a race-high 12 laps and finished third. Hand, running a one-off in the No. 60 RFK Racing Ford entry, finished fourth with Michael McDowell rounding out the top five.\n\nRicky Stenhouse Jr., Todd Gilliland, William Byron, Kyle Busch and Ryan Blaney made up the rest of the top-10 finishers.\n\nThe odds-on favorites entering the race were Shane van Gisbergen and Kyle Larson. Van Gisbergan saw his hopes of a weekend sweep in Chicago end on lap 25 when a spinning Chase Briscoe clipped the back of his car, sending the No. 16 Kaulig Racing Chevy into the turn six concrete barrier.\n\nSVG finished 40th after winning the Xfinity Series race on Saturday and winning stage one on Sunday.\n\n\"I just got taken out,\" van Gisbergen said. \"It's gutting, you know? The Saucy Nuggs Camaro was really good, and I don't know, I felt like I was driving well within myself the whole race, under control. And that restart, I looked behind in turn 6 and I had a decent gap behind me and just turned in and, yeah. Took me by surprise there.\"\n\n\"It's frustrating. Obviously, we had a car good enough to win.\"\n\nLarson finished 39th after sliding head on into the turn six tire barriers on lap 34. Larson was running third at the time of the accident.\n\n\"As soon as I hit the brake pedal, it was not slowing down,\" Larson said. \"I just assumed I was locked up.\"\n\nGibbs jumped out to the lead on the initial start with the opening stage splitting the field into those who started on slicks and those who opted for wet weather tires. While there were showers at various spots and times in the opening stage, most who opted for wet weather tires either pitted for slicks or fell off the pace.\n\nThe slower cars eventually played a role in the stage win. When Gibbs was hung up in lapped traffic, van Gisbergen made a bold three-wide move on lap 12 in turn 12 to take the lead.\n\nCorey LaJoie brought out the first caution of the race on lap 17 with a spin off turn four. Heavier rain brought the stage to an end with van Gisbergen picking up the stage win. Bells, Gibbs, Briscoe and Larson made up the top-five stage points finishers.\n\nThe opening green flag lap of stage 2 was chaotic and ultimately altered the course of the day. With rain starting to pick up, Bubba Wallace spun and collected Daniel Suarez in turn two while Briscoe clipped van Gisbergen in turn 6 to bring out the caution.\n\nA red flag for standing water soon turned into a weather delay for heavy rain. Once the cars retook the track an hour and 43 minutes later with 50 laps to go, it became a race to darkness.\n\nAfter another strong restart by Gibbs, Bell made a pass for the lead in turn 7 on lap 30. Four laps later, Larson brought out the caution for his accident in turn 6.\n\nWith three laps to go in stage 2 and about half an hour until sun down, differing pit strategies sent the leaderboard into chaos. After a group of cars pitted for slick tires, Bell and most of the frontrunners followed with two laps until the stage break.\n\nThe exceptions were Hand and Bowman, who raced all the way to the green-checkered flag to decide a stage winner. Hand held off Bowman at the line with Brad Keselowski, Carson Hocevar and Martin Truex Jr rounding out the top-five finishers in the stage.\n\nHand held off Bowman for a few laps after the restart, but Bowman made the pass on lap 51 just moments before a caution when Josh Berry buried his car into the turn two tire barrier.\n\nWhen the clock struck 8:20 p.m. local time, NASCAR rules officially made the race into a two-lap shootout.\n\nReddick, who managed a three-wide pass for third just a minute earlier, was able to be within two second of Bowman when they took the white flag.

He beat Tyler Reddick and Joey Hand.\n\nHere are our winners and losers from Sunday's Chicago street race.\n\nBowman snapped 80-race winless streak, holding off Tyler Reddick. He is the last of the four Hendrick Motorsports drivers to win a race this season, joining William Byron, Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson.\n\nTy Gibbs\n\nGive Gibbs credit. He can navigate a road course. Gibbs finished third and raced near the front for a good portion of the race. This third-place finish came after finishing third in Austin, Texas at COTA. He qualified second both road races.\n\nJoey Hand\n\nWho is Joey Hand? Right? Hand finished fourth for RFK Racing and won the second stage. He was brought in specifically for the Chicago street race. It was his first Cup start since 2022. Hand a road racer, has been helping Ford with its Gen-7 road race development.\n\nWHO IS IN? NASCAR playoff picture: Cup Series points standings after Chicago street race\n\nNASCAR CHICAGO STREET RACE: Who won NASCAR Cup race in Chicago? Winner is Alex Bowman, plus full results\n\nLarson and van Gisbergen were the race favorites for Sunday. They finished 39th and 40th -- the last two spots, respectively. van Gisbergen, who won the 2023 Chicago street race, was taken out by Chase Briscoe before the race was red flagged because of rain. Larson missed a turned and went almost windshield deep into a tire barrier. So much for a showdown between two of the top road-course drivers in the Cup Series.\n\nNASCAR\n\nMaybe this is simply bad luck. Two straight years the Chicago street race has been ran on wet conditions. Sure, NASCAR can't control the weather. But they need to find a way to run it earlier so if it does rain, there is a time buffer to get the race in. As cool as a NASCAR street race is, there is only one shot. There is no coming back Monday to finish it if its rained out.\n\nTyler Reddick\n\nGive Reddick credit in that he knows how close he's been to winning the past two weeks. Last week he was upset with not being able to top Joey Logano at Nashville. This week, he finished second and had a chance to run down Bowman for first, but turned a corner short and brushed against the wall, ruining his chance to catch Bowman.

The latter made an assumption that the surface on the streets of Chicago would dry before Nascar had to end the race at 8:20 p.m. local time.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nBowman drove his Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet around road course racing expert Joey Hand, who was competing for RFK Racing, with eight laps remaining. He not only got around the expert, but he drove away from the field and held off a hard-charging Christopher Bell, who was on the slicks and gaining over two seconds a lap on Bowman. However, Bell hit the wall on the final lap and ruined his chances of taking home a trophy.\n\nBowman crossed the finish line in first, ending an 80-race winless drought dating back to March of 2022 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The win silences his critics, many of whom said he is not the same driver he once was after breaking his back last year.\n\n\"Everybody that said I couldn't win and don't deserve to be at Hendrick Motorsports and all that bullsh*t, cheers to you,\" Bowman said at the conclusion of the post-race press conference.\n\nBowman is now locked into the playoffs. It's a major accomplishment for Bowman given he has sustained multiple injuries over the last few years. Among them were the back injury, as well as a concussion.\n\n\"It's more about, for me, just overcoming everything that's happened in my life in the last two years,\" Bowman said. \"It's been really difficult, right? The concussion and then to straight away go break my back after recovering from that and then to just tremendously struggle through last year and kind of lose our way a little bit, it was really difficult.\n\n\"There's a lot of noise, and that makes it difficult for the team. I'm proud of my guys for being able to shut that out and work hard each and every week and have confidence in the decisions that we make and the race cars that we bring to the racetrack.\"\n\nBowman can now breathe a sigh of relief. He has been rumored to be on the hot seat at Hendrick Motorsports, even though his contract is through 2026. However, his ride is safe and Vice Chairman Jeff Gordon shut down any rumors of his departure.\n\n\"As far as we're concerned, Ally loves him and we love him,\" Gordon said. \"He's a car guy, and there's a reason why he came to Hendrick Motorsports, and he's proven he can win. Today was not an easy set of circumstances, and he proved he can win in these tough conditions, as well, on a road course.\n\n\"I understand why people want to talk and -- it's a tough business. When you're at Hendrick Motorsports, you do expect, especially when the other three have won, to be in that same category, and it hasn't been happening. Hopefully, this dispels a lot of the rumors.\"\n\nBowman now has eight career Cup Series win, each coming with Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nAll four Hendrick Motorsports drivers are now locked into the playoffs. Bowman now has 11 top 10s on the year, nearing his 2022 total of 12 and exceeding his 2023 amonut of 10. His career-high for top 10s is 16 (2021) and he is on pace to surpass that this season.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_slick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racing slick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Street_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Street Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFK_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RFK Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Bell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Hand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Hand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race track"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668c3cebf26177c91eb4e848/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Erin Hooley/Associated Press\n\nCHICAGO -- Alex Bowman spent his 30th birthday in an Iowa hospital after breaking his back in a short-track accident. Feeling as if he had let everyone down, it was a tough moment.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWHAT: The Great American Getaway 400 Presented by VisitPa.com\n\nWHEN: 2:30 p.m. Sunday\n\nWHERE: Pocono Raceway\n\nTELEVISION: USA\n\nThat was just last year, and it seemed like a long time ago Sunday night.\n\nBowman is a NASCAR Cup Series winner once again after he held off Tyler Reddick in a shortened Grant Park 165 on a rainy street course in downtown Chicago. It was his first victory since March 2022 in Las Vegas, stopping an 80-race drought.\n\n\"There's a lot of emotions that go away with this because of how hard that has been,\" Bowman said.\n\nWith his eighth career Cup Series win, Bowman became the last of the four Hendrick Motorsports drivers to secure a playoff spot. He is the 12th Cup driver to win this year, leaving four remaining slots in the playoffs with six races left in the regular season.\n\nIt also was the first Cup win for Blake Harris, who took over as Bowman's crew chief before the 2023 season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBowman has 11 top-10 finishes this year, but his winless drought had ramped up speculation about his future at Hendrick. That all seemed to go away this weekend.\n\n\"I understand why people want to talk. ... It's a tough business,\" said NASCAR Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon, a Hendrick executive. \"When you're at Hendrick Motorsports, you do expect, especially when the other three have won, to be in that same category, and it hasn't been happening. Hopefully this dispels a lot of the rumors.\"\n\nBowman's contract with Hendrick runs through the 2026 season. He made it clear that he felt the speculation about his future was overblown, but he definitely heard the talk.\n\n\"I think you need to win races whenever you're at HMS,\" he said. \"But certainly nobody has made me feel like I'm on the hot seat. There's never been a single conversation with a single person that has questioned anything to do with that at all. It's all been, what do you need, how can we help you, how can we support the team.\"\n\nBowman is in his seventh full season at Hendrick. He got his first Cup Series victory at Chicagoland Speedway in 2019. The Arizona native won again at Fontana in 2020, and then earned a career-best four wins during a breakout performance in 2021.\n\nBut everything changed after he won at Las Vegas in March 2022. That same year, he was sidelined for five races after he sustained a concussion in a crash at Texas Motor Speedway. Then he had the back injury last year that kept him out for three points races and the All-Star festivities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The concussion and then to straight away go break my back after recovering from that and then to just tremendously struggle through last year and kind of lose our way a little bit, it was really difficult,\" he said.\n\nComing into Chicago, there was no sign that Bowman's drought was about to end. He had an engine issue at New Hampshire that ended his day on the 144th of 305 laps. He finished 14th at Nashville Superspeedway last weekend.\n\n\"I think the speed has been there,\" Harris said. \"We talked, we had an engine failure at Loudon and we had an engine failure here last year at Chicago. As we talk through those things, he's like, man, right as we're in this point battle, and I'm like, we're one race away from that not mattering.\"\n\nThat one race was Sunday, and now Bowman and Harris can take a closer look at what they might do in the playoffs.\n\n\"I think race car drivers, they come up and they have accidents and sometimes you have injuries,\" Gordon said, \"and you find out how tough you are mentally and physically and how bad you want to do it. Alex has been through a few significant injuries, and he's come back I feel like stronger each time.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nBrunswick clinic to host garden tour fundraiser Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pocono Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Superspeedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Superspeedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicagoland_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicagoland Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontana,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fontana, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fontana, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/07/NASCAR_Chicago_Auto_Racing_24311_5653db-1720472716.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Bob Pockrass of Fox Sports reported on Sunday that NASCAR was going to review the incident since Wallace contracted Bowman after he unhooked his window netting.\n\nWhen speaking to NBC Sports, Bowman issued an apology to Wallace. \"I have to apologize again to the 23 guys,\" Bowman said. \"Just messed up and trying to get my windshield wiper on and missed a corner and ruined their day. So I hate that. I'm still embarrassed by it, but we have a trophy to take home.\"\n\nAfter starting the 2024 Cup Series season strong with two consecutive top-five finishes, Wallace has been doing everything he can to clinch a playoff spot. His last victory came in 2022 when he won in Kansas. And despite not earning a victory in 2023, Wallace reached the playoffs for the first time in his career.\n\n\"May sound like a joke but my brain is mush. The psychological piece to plate racing is massive,\" Wallace wrote on X earlier this year after his top-five finishes.\n\n\"Yes it's big any other race but receiving and digesting the info from @FreddieKraft lap by lap, corner by corner to make sure you're in the right spot is intense... You have to be ON from start to finish. Restarts at 1.5 miles is a lot like this..but that's 2-3 laps. Not 460. Proud of this 23 team. I set us back today but nothing we haven't overcome before. There is something special with this group this year!\n\n\"Time to really lock in and get the stars aligned. Back to back top 5s is great start... but there is 24 more left. Y'all enjoy it for me. Bourbon me.\"\n\nBowman won his first race since the 2022 season and is the 12th different driver to win a Cup Series race this year. After the race, Bowman talked about how he was going to celebrate the victory.\n\n\"Last one we won, we didn't really get to celebrate,\" Bowman said. \"We're going to drink so much damn bourbon tonight, it's going to be a bad deal.

Bowman was in the process of raising his visor and wiping sweat from his brow when the collision occurred, and he appeared shocked at the response from Bubba Wallace.\n\nBut it was clearly on his mind immediately following the race, because he quickly apologized to Wallace for the earlier collision on the track.\n\n\"I have to apologize again to the 23 guys,\" Bowman said. \"Just messed up and trying to get my windshield wiper on and missed a corner and ruined their day. So I hate that. I'm still embarrassed by it, but we have a trophy to take home.\"\n\nNASCAR, of course, will now take a look at Wallace's dooring of Bowman to see if it merits any penalties. It very well could be a violation of the organization's code of conduct penalty, though enforcement can vary.\n\nPenalties are typically handed down on Tuesday evenings.\n\nThe frustration for Bubba Wallace comes as he's on the edge of the playoff cut line. Going into the day, Bowman was just inside the cut at No. 16, while Wallace was 51 points back below the cut line at No. 17.\n\nNeedless to say, the frustration boiled over after the race with Wallace's dangerous bump.\n\nBubba Wallace has had a tough season, unable to quite get things going despite some quality races here and there.

As Alex Bowman was celebrating his first race win of the season, the #23 slammed the #48 into the wall during the cooldown lap. This was in retaliation to when the Hendrick Motorsports star spun the 23XI Racing driver around during the race. There have been mixed reactions from fans about it ever since.\n\nWallace was not apologetic after the incident and fans did not expect him to issue an apology. They believe that he was rightfully frustrated and Bowman was at fault. \"You love to see it! Bowman trying to wreck everyone. He's a hack,\" one fan wrote on X. \"Ima give Bubba a pass on that one. Nobody likes Alex Bowman,\" quipped another user.\n\nHowever, there is no denying that the contact was dangerous. The 23XI Racing driver was not let off the hook by the entire NASCAR fanbase. \"Just adds to the reasons people don't like Wallace,\" one fan opined. \"Bubba once again proving he can't be trusted with a car. He's gonna hurt someone,\" wrote another.\n\nNormally in situations like this NASCAR comes out with a penalty for the culprit. However, Bowman does not want the 23XI Racing driver to be penalized despite causing contact.\n\nThe Hendrick Motorsports star took full responsibility for the earlier contact. At the time, the rain was coming down and he was struggling to get his windshield wiper working. Bowman was not focused on the upcoming braking zone and missed his mark. His tires locked up and he ran straight into Wallace.\n\n\"I'm pretty hard on myself when I make mistakes like that and I've been embarrassed about it since it happened. The rain delay was a lot of me just sitting there being embarrassed and being mad at myself. He has every right to be mad,\" he told NBC Sports.\n\nHopefully, things will calm down between the two racers by the next race weekend.

A mid-race red flag due to rain, however, plagued this year's Chicago Street Race. Still, Sunday's viewership was 35% higher than the average NASCAR Cup Series race on the network in 2023.\n\nThis year's race saw a first-time winner this season in Alex Bowman, whose strategy of staying on wet-weather tires rather than pitting for slicks paid off, as he passed Joey Hand on Lap 51 and didn't look back from there.\n\nBowman outlasted the field after a day which went sideways from the beginning. Just as drivers fired their engines for the start of the race, rain began to fall, putting the race on hold. It eventually got underway but came to a halt just after Stage 1 when the track became too wet to race. From there, drivers battled the conditions on wet weather tires, racing until 8:20 p.m. local time when the clock ran out for race completion.\n\nThough Tyler Reddick made a bid to catch and potentially pass Bowman on the final lap, the Hendrick Motorsports driver held on to secure his eighth career victory, breaking an 80-race winless streak.\n\n\"Man, let me tell you about how great NASCAR is to us drivers.

I'm pretty excited about that,\" Bowman said after the race. \"But I've got a couple bottles, that were bought early in 2022, that were like, 'The next win, we're going to drink these,' and they've been sitting on the counter way too f -- ing long.\n\n\"So yeah, everybody that said I couldn't win and don't deserve to be at Hendrick Motorsports and all that bulls -- , cheers to you.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_geddes@on3.com", "name": "Nick Geddes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_van_Gisbergen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane van Gisbergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_(Chicago)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park (Chicago)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_City_Business_Journals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American City Business Journals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Hand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joey Hand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_slick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racing slick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_tyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rain tyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/08171625/ratings-revealed-for-2024-nascar-cup-series-chicago-street-race.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

That's just part of this deal sometimes.\"\n\nIf Bowman's post-race interview Sunday (July 7) after his eighth career Cup win did anything, it let everyone know how important snapping an 80-race winless streak was to the 30-year-old driver.\n\nIt also served as a reminder that Bowman has one of the funniest and likable personalities in the sport.\n\nDespite being tied for the second most top-10 finishes (11) through 20 races this season, at no point has Bowman felt like a frontrunner.\n\nHow can you be when you've only led 14 laps?\n\nAnd how much confidence can you feel when you're struggling to prove you still have it after missing time over two seasons for a concussion and a broken back?\n\n\"We've kind of sucked ever since, and I didn't -- you start to second-guess if you're ever going to get a chance to win a race again,\" Bowman said with the sun setting on downtown Chicago.\n\nHe was even more candid about his struggles to return to winning form when he made it to the media center.\n\n\"The concussion, and then to straight away go break my back after recovering from that, and then to just tremendously struggle through last year and kind of lose our way a little bit, it was really difficult,\" Bowman said. \"There's a lot of noise, and that makes it difficult for the team. ...\n\n\"It has certainly been a large mental test to go through everything that has happened in the last two years and try to continue to overcome that each and every week, especially when things aren't going your way, and honestly the last month has been super frustrating for us.

I didn't need it. Certainly a lot in my life that I don't need. I'm just appreciative of it.\"\n\nIf you had any doubts about the importance of Sunday's win -- or had doubts about his sponsor's commitment to him in the wake of his struggles -- read the tweet from Ally Financial's chief marketing officer after the race.\n\nFrom the outside, Bowman was seemingly the ugly duckling of Hendrick Motorsports' four drivers, despite Chase Elliott's rough go of it over the same span and also going winless in 2023.\n\nBut that's Chase Elliott. A Cup champion and NASCAR's golden goose. He's not going anywhere, even after one bad season.\n\nThough, as always, any fan chatter on social media should never be taken as reality when it comes to a driver's prospects.\n\n\"Yeah, certainly I have a contract through the end of 2026,\" Bowman noted Sunday. \"That hasn't been questioned as much as Twitter would like to believe it has.\"\n\nTeam Vice Chairman Jeff Gordon seemingly made that even clearer during his press conference when asked if Bowman's Chicago triumph was \"securing him at Hendrick.\"\n\n\"As far as we're concerned, Ally loves him and we love him,\" Gordon said. \"He's a car guy, and there's a reason why he came to Hendrick Motorsports, and he's proven he can win. Today was not an easy set of circumstances, and he proved he can win in these tough conditions, as well, on a road course.\n\n\"I understand why people want to talk and -- it's a tough business. When you're at Hendrick Motorsports, you do expect, especially when the other three have won, to be in that same category, and it hasn't been happening.\n\n\"Hopefully, this dispels a lot of the rumors.\"\n\nIt's never easy being the third, or even the fourth, wheel at Hendrick.\n\nJust ask Wally Dallenbach Jr., Ken Schrader, Ricky Craven, Casey Mears, Brian Vickers, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kasey Kahne.\n\nIf/when Bowman get another win in the No. 48, he'll tie Earnhardt as the leader among that group of notable drivers for number of wins with Hendrick with nine.\n\nFor being with the team full-time for seven years -- and missing time for injury -- that's not too shabby.\n\nIt also helps to have the Cup Series' only remaining full-season sponsor in Ally having your back.\n\nSo why not cut loose a little in the Windy City to mark the occasion of a pivotal and personal win?\n\n\"I've got a couple bottles (of whiskey bourbon) that were bought early in '22 that were like, 'the next win we're going to drink these,' and they've been sitting on the counter way too fucking long,\" Bowman said.\n\n\"Everybody that said I couldn't win and don't deserve to be at Hendrick Motorsports and all that bullshit, cheers to you.\"", "source": {"uri": "frontstretch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Frontstretch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_mcfadin@frontstretch.com", "name": "Daniel McFadin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Dallenbach_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wally Dallenbach Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Earnhardt_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dale Earnhardt Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Vickers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Vickers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Schrader", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ken Schrader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Mears", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casey Mears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasey_Kahne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kasey Kahne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Craven", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Craven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://frontstretch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Cup-Chicago-street-Hendrick-Motorsports-celebrates-Alex-Bowman-win-Credit-NKP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 366, "textEnd": 372}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

You're expected to win races. Plural. Excuses are nonexistent. The pressure is intense when you're with NASCAR's most successful organization, awash with every benefit at your disposal.\n\nBowman has lived this situation, having experienced it ever since 2017 when Hendrick selected him to replace the retiring Dale Earnhardt Jr. And he understands why, amid a winless streak that dates back to March 2022, there had been increasing whispers regarding how long he'd remain as driver of the No. 48 Hendrick car beyond this season.\n\n\"It's important that you jell and the chemistry comes and the effort is there, but you've got to win,\" said Jeff Gordon, Hendrick Motorsports vice chairman. \"Not just because you're at Hendrick Motorsports, it's because it's really hard to get the team where they need to be to compete at the highest level on a regular basis, make the playoffs and then compete at a high level in the playoffs without victories coming to just remind everybody that we're doing the right things and we're working in the right direction and we're working well together.\"\n\nWhile Bowman's future is solidified, the speculation did carry some merit.\n\nIn addition to being winless this season before Sunday, Bowman has had to watch all three Hendrick teammates win and lead the points standings for at least a week. That makes it clear the quality of Hendrick's equipment on a week-to-week basis.\n\nAnd as Kyle Larson, Chase Elliott and William Byron have soared, Bowman has had just an OK season. In the 19 previous races before Chicago, Bowman had led all of six laps and sat on the playoff cut line, in danger of missing NASCAR's postseason for a second consecutive year.\n\n\"As far as we're concerned, (sponsor) Ally loves him and we love him,\" Gordon said. \"He's a car guy, and there's a reason why he came to Hendrick Motorsports, and he's proven he can win.\n\n\"I understand why people want to talk and -- it's a tough business. When you're at Hendrick Motorsports, you do expect, especially when the other three have won, to be in that same category, and it hasn't been happening. Hopefully this dispels a lot of the rumors.\"\n\nComing off a breakthrough four-win season in 2021, Bowman was riding high. The upward trajectory continued into the early part of 2022 when he won in March at Las Vegas, the third race of the season.\n\nThat victory would be his last before Chicago. He then went through a summer slump, only to get hot in the playoffs before a concussion sidelined him for five races, ending any shot at a championship.\n\nThe rollercoaster continued into 2023. A strong start to the season was curtailed when he broke his back in a crash while racing a sprint car in Iowa. He spent his 30th birthday in a hospital. At the time of injury, he had led the Cup standings for three weeks and had a series-best 10.3 average finish.\n\n\"It's really difficult,\" Bowman said. \"Obviously, we have all the tools we need to win, and our teammates have been really good throughout that time. But we just couldn't put it together.\n\n\"It has certainly been a large mental test to go through everything that has happened in the last two years and try to continue to overcome that each and every week, especially when things aren't going your way. And honestly, the last month has been super frustrating for us. We've had a lot of things outside of our control, cost us a lot of points, and it's been really frustrating.\"\n\nAfter Bowman and his team won at Las Vegas, they decided not to celebrate, as they didn't return to North Carolina until the wee hours of the morning. They figured more victories were surely coming soon, providing ample opportunity to sip the good stuff.\n\n\"We had won a lot pretty recently to that,\" Bowman said. \"And we all landed at like 4 (a.m.) and every other race we had celebrated and had so much fun with the team and we were all kind of like, 'Nah, it's too late, we don't need to celebrate, we'll celebrate the next one or whatever.' I have regretted that ever since.\"\n\nHendrick's support of Bowman has been steadfast. Not once, Bowman said, has anyone within the organization indicated to him he was on the hot seat.\n\nStill, Bowman knows that a Hendrick driver needs to win. And he wasn't doing that. Nor was he a sure bet to even qualify for the playoffs.\n\nBut then came Sunday. He impressively navigated the Chicago Street Course over the final eight laps despite being at a severe disadvantage on tires that were worn and not equipped to properly handle the track conditions.\n\nThe win was the eighth of his career. It was also the one he perhaps appreciates the most considering what it meant to him.\n\n\"I broke my back, had a brain injury, and we've kind of sucked ever since,\" Bowman said. \"You start to second-guess if you're ever going to get a chance to win a race again.\n\n\"But as a human being, I'm just a dude trying to do my job the best I possibly can, and I see everything that gets said about me. So to be able to overcome what I've gone through and to end up back here, it feels really good. I didn't need it. Certainly a lot in my life that I don't need.

Feeling as if he had let everyone down, it was a tough moment.\n\nThat was just last year, and it seemed like a long time ago Sunday night.\n\nBowman is a NASCAR Cup Series winner once again after he held off Tyler Reddick in a shortened Grant Park 165 on a rainy street course in downtown Chicago. It was his first victory since March 2022 in Las Vegas, stopping an 80-race drought.\n\n\"There's a lot of emotions that go away with this because of how hard that has been,\" Bowman said.\n\nWith his eighth career Cup Series win, Bowman became the last of the four Hendrick Motorsports drivers to secure a playoff spot. He is the 12th Cup driver to win this year, leaving four remaining slots in the playoffs with six races left in the regular season.\n\nIt also was the first Cup win for Blake Harris, who took over as Bowman's crew chief before the 2023 season.\n\nBowman has 11 top-10 finishes this year, but his winless drought had ramped up speculation about his future at Hendrick. That all seemed to go away this weekend.\n\n\"I understand why people want to talk. ... It's a tough business,\" said NASCAR Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon, a Hendrick executive. \"When you're at Hendrick Motorsports, you do expect, especially when the other three have won, to be in that same category, and it hasn't been happening. Hopefully this dispels a lot of the rumors.\"\n\nBowman's contract with Hendrick runs through the 2026 season. He made it clear that he felt the speculation about his future was overblown, but he definitely heard the talk.\n\n\"I think you need to win races whenever you're at HMS,\" he said. \"But certainly nobody has made me feel like I'm on the hot seat. There's never been a single conversation with a single person that has questioned anything to do with that at all. It's all been, what do you need, how can we help you, how can we support the team.\"\n\nBowman is in his seventh full season at Hendrick. He got his first Cup Series victory at Chicagoland Speedway in 2019. The Arizona native won again at Fontana in 2020, and then earned a career-best four wins during a breakout performance in 2021.\n\nBut everything changed after he won at Las Vegas in March 2022. That same year, he was sidelined for five races after he sustained a concussion in a crash at Texas Motor Speedway. Then he had the back injury last year that kept him out for three points races and the All-Star festivities.\n\n\"The concussion and then to straight away go break my back after recovering from that and then to just tremendously struggle through last year and kind of lose our way a little bit, it was really difficult,\" he said.\n\nComing into Chicago, there was no sign that Bowman's drought was about to end. He had an engine issue at New Hampshire that ended his day on the 144th of 305 laps. He finished 14th at Nashville Superspeedway last weekend.\n\n\"I think the speed has been there,\" Harris said. \"We talked, we had an engine failure at Loudon and we had an engine failure here last year at Chicago. As we talk through those things, he's like, man, right as we're in this point battle, and I'm like, we're one race away from that not mattering.\"\n\nThat one race was Sunday, and now Bowman and Harris can take a closer look at what they might do in the playoffs.\n\n\"I think race car drivers, they come up and they have accidents and sometimes you have injuries,\" Gordon said, \"and you find out how tough you are mentally and physically and how bad you want to do it. Alex has been through a few significant injuries, and he's come back I feel like stronger each time.\"", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_cohen@apnews.com", "name": "Jay Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Superspeedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Superspeedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicagoland_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicagoland Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontana,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fontana, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fontana, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/aa34cfd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4830x2717+0+252/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F42%2F3f%2F172cc613b05c08e9fec03ce84e24%2F65968aaa32aa4509b0049cc887b8fad5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Riding an 80 race winless streak, Alex Bowman willed his way back to the winner's circle on the Chicago Street Course. A first career road course win for the Hendrick driver comes in perfect time, sealing up his Playoff fate. Following an injury-plagued two years since his last victory, Bowman promised a big celebration after this Windy City win.\n\nTy Gibbs initially took off from the front row, but Stage 1 eventually went to Shane van Gisbergen. The No. 16 took command navigating through lapped traffic and won the opening Stage under yellow.\n\nThe prerace favorite's day would come to an early end, however. SVG's car found the outside barrier in turn six after contact from Chase Briscoe, causing terminal damage to the Kaulig Racing Chevrolet.\n\nNot long after the race resumed following a nearly two-hour rain delay, another favorite's day came to a crashing end. Chasing down Gibbs from third, Kyle Larson overcooked entry into turn six and nosed hard into the tire barrier. Larson and SVG were two of the heavyweight favorites, and were the first two DNFs.\n\nChristopher Bell led under the rain delay, but had to short pit Stage 2 from the lead. This handed a first career Stage win to RFK Racing's part timer Joey Hand.\n\nOn the Stage 3 restart, Alex Bowman worked over and eventually passed Hand in turn five. Despite one more restart, nobody could wrestle the lead away from the Ally No. 48. Tyler Reddick had a tire advantage and was closing in on the last lap, but to no avail. Alex Bowman takes his eighth career Cup victory and first in 80 races, dating back to March 2022.\n\n\"Anytime you go to the racetrack with Hendrick Motorsports you got a shot,\" Bowman said. \"First off, I have to apologize again to the No. 23 guys. Just messed up trying to get my windshield wiper on, missed a corner and ruined their day. I hate that, still embarrassed about it, but we have a trophy to take home. I know it means a lot to this team. They put me in position to win the race.\"\n\n\"Man I broke my back, had a brain injury, and we've kind of sucked ever since. You start to second guess if you're ever going to get a chance to win a race again. The last one we won, we didn't really get to celebrate. We're going to drink so much damn bourbon tonight. It's going to be a bad deal. I'm probably going to wake up naked on the bathroom floor again. Man that's just part of this deal sometimes.\"\n\n\"Just thanks to Ally and everybody at Hendrick Motorsports, everyone who makes this deal go around. Mr H., Jeff, shoutout to Chloe at home. She's at home with the pups, it's like the only race she's missed all year. I'm sure she's pissed off at me for that one, but she's at home with Huck, and excited to get there. It'll be a good night.\"\n\nBowman's triumph marks a perfect Playoff representation from Hendrick Motorsports once again. HMS had not put all four cars into the postseason since 2022. Bowman is the 12th different winner through 20 races of 2024, see the rest of the Playoff standings below.\n\nThe Cup Series rolls onward next week from Pocono Raceway. The Great American Getaway 400 goes green Sunday at 2:30 p.m. ET on USA, MRN, and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio Channel 90. The Cup Series has seen new winners over the last two weeks.

Wallace was penalized under Sections 4.4 B & D of the NASCAR rulebook detailing the sanctioning body's code of conduct.\n\nWhile racing for a position early in stage 2, and amid what had been a points battle between the two for the last spot above the playoff cut line, Bowman had spun Wallace in turn 2, setting him back deep in the field after he had run in the top 10 during the opening stage and effectively taking him out of contention. After Bowman went on to win the race, Wallace retaliated during the cooldown lap, doorslamming Bowman's car while his window net was down and squeezing him into the outside wall.\n\nNASCAR's decision to fine Wallace following Chicago comes on the heels of a separate incident at New Hampshire that also bordered on a safety issue, when Wallace expressed his displeasure with Noah Gragson for a crash in turn 1 by driving up close to Gragson's car while it was stopped in its pit box. According to Bob Pockrass of Fox Sports, safety concerns were a factor in penalizing Wallace for dooring Bowman, as the contact was enough that it knocked Bowman's hands off his steering wheel.\n\nBowman had taken responsibility and was apologetic for the contact earlier in the race, saying that he did not believe Wallace should be penalized given that it was light contact and \"plenty deserved\".\n\n\"Bubba and I, we had our deal a long time ago (at Charlotte in 2019), but even today we raced the hell out of each other,\" Bowman said. \"We gave each other a lot of space, and it was really fun racing with him, and we've raced each other super fair and super clean, and I just messed up and ruined his day, so I hate that.\"\n\nThe past two weeks have put Wallace in a difficult and frustrating position, as two of the drivers he had been directly competing with for the last spot above the playoff cut line have won two weeks in a row, putting Wallace now 45 points back of Chris Buescher for the last remaining playoff spot on points. Wallace made the playoffs for the first time in his career last year and finished 10th in the championship standings, but he has yet to win a race in 2024 to secure a playoff berth.\n\nCuriously, there was an absence of discipline from NASCAR for a similar incident on the cooldown lap in which Chase Elliott retaliated against Daniel Suarez for spinning him out on the final lap in similar fashion. While Elliott has not had a recent history of such behavior, Pockrass reported that NASCAR plans to speak with Elliott concerning his own actions.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_taranto@cbssports.com", "name": "Steven Taranto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Pockrass", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Pockrass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Gragson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Gragson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Buescher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Buescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/10/8ccb29d8-13f9-4b76-93a0-805e2d7a3938/thumbnail/1200x675/4520042fa0738575865508ae18e1aac4/gettyimages-2160577646.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

In doing so, he put an end to his 80-race winless streak and qualified for the 2024 playoffs. The rain-shortened race came to an end after 58 laps of twisting and turning around the 2.2-mile street circuit. By the time the checkered flag waved, Bowman stayed ahead of Ty Gibbs and Tyler Reddick to collect the win.\n\nWhat makes it mean a lot for the #48 Chevrolet Camaro driver are the hurdles that he went through over the past couple of years. He suffered from a brain injury in 2022 and then a broken back in 2023. With talks of him losing his seat in 2025 beginning to find ground, he has now broken through all the doubts with strong command.\n\nHe said to the press after winning the race, \"Man, I broke my back, had a brain injury, and we've kind of sucked ever since. You start to second-guess if you're ever going to get a chance to win a race again.\" He continued, \"Last one we won [Vegas, 2022], we didn't really get to celebrate. We're going to drink so much damn bourbon tonight, it's going to be a bad deal.\"\n\nTeam owner Rick Hendrick now finds all four of his cars through to the playoffs. However, Sunday proved to be a day of extremeness for him - courtesy of the performance of Bowman's teammates.\n\nDriving the #24 Camaro, William Byron managed a top-10 finish. Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott, the two who were expected to be at their best, wound up far too behind the field than was worthy of them.\n\nLarson had won pole position for the race but was passed by Gibbs on the very first lap. He then got involved in the first accident after the rain stoppage when he slammed his car into the tire barrier in Turn 6.\n\nHis car was damaged beyond extent and his day had to come to an end. He was given a 39th-place finish. The only other driver who fared worse than him was Shane van Gisbergen who crashed way earlier.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gowtham_ramalingam@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Gowtham Ramalingam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Street circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Camaro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Camaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_(Chicago)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park (Chicago)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Gibbs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Gibbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byron_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Byron (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_van_Gisbergen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane van Gisbergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Hendrick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Hendrick"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/9b9fe4d4-q9efg.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Everything was fine and it was plenty deserved.\"\n\nBut apparently NASCAR didn't agree.\n\nToday, it was announced that Bubba has been fined $50k for the contact after the race, though he wasn't assessed a points penalty which I'm sure is what the team was most worried about.\n\nInterestingly, there was no penalty for Chase Elliott, who also made contact with Daniel Suarez after the race out of frustration for an incident on the track late in the race.\n\nSo what was the difference between the two incidents? Well, I guess we'll have to wait for NASCAR to explain why one got a penalty and one didn't, but my guess is one big reason is because the Elliott vs. Suarez incident was in the heat of the moment, whereas Bubba's incident happened before the rain delay and allowed him time to cool off before deciding to put Bowman into the wall.\n\nNASCAR probably also took issue with the fact that Bowman already had his window net down when Bubba put him into the wall, and considered the incident a safety violation. And Bubba's contact with Bowman put him into the wall and lifted his tire off the ground, which NASCAR probably saw as more egregious than Chase's contact with Suarez.\n\n(Not saying I agree with their reasoning, just trying to guess what it was).\n\nEither way, Bubba managed to avoid a points penalty, which is important as he sits near the playoff bubble.

The win is the eighth of Bowman's career and first of 2024. He's now the 12th winner of the season and locked into the playoffs. It's also the first career win for crew chief Blake Harris.\n\nAnd don't forget Joey Hand. The road course specialist led nine laps in his eighth Cup Series start and won the second stage before finishing fourth in a third car for RFK Racing. Hand, making his first start since 2022, was by far the best finisher for RFK on Sunday.\n\nFor the second year in a row in Chicago and the fourth week in a row this season, rain played a role in how the race played out.\n\nWet-weather tires allowed the race to run, but like last month at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, despite the novelty, it probably wasn't the same race fans would have seen had the track stayed dry ... and both races would likely have stayed dry had they started earlier.\n\nDoes that mean it's time for NASCAR to go to earlier start times?\n\nIt's past time, actually. While earlier starts wouldn't end all weather problems, it's hard to argue that a lot of races in recent years since 3:30 p.m. and later (Eastern) starts haven't been affected by weather (and/or darkness as a result of weather delays). And many of them would have been avoided if the races had started at 1 p.m. ET. Races started at or around that time for decades with no issues.\n\nMaybe there was a reason for that.\n\nPole winner Kyle Larson gave up the lead at the green flag but lurked close enough throughout the first stage to stalk the lead. After the rain delay, though, Larson was just a little too hot on a wet track and slid into a tire barrier.\n\nHe tried to get it going again but the damage was too much, and Larson was done for the day in 39th spot.\n\nDefending race winner Shane van Gisbergen won the Xfinity Series race on Saturday, making it a perfect three for three on road courses in that series in 2024. He picked up right where he left off early, driving to the lead in stage one, which he went on to win under caution. But when the rains came in earnest in stage two, van Gisbergen was tagged by a sliding Chase Briscoe and slammed into a concrete barrier, enough to end his day in 40th.\n\nDefending Cup champion Ryan Blaney never really found the speed he needed on Sunday. He hovered around mid-pack for most of the day, but the No. 12 team let the strategy play out and the race came to them. That paid off in the form of a 10th-place finish. It wasn't the type of race that will win a driver a title in this day and age, but it was the type that puts one in the position for a playoff run.\n\nThe race wasn't exactly a Wild West show, but at times it felt like one amid heavy rain, wet track blues and varying pit strategy.\n\nWhen push came to shove, it was pit strategy that decided the race. Knowing the timer was ticking down to zero hour, some teams, including Bowman's No. 48, felt that staying out on wet-weather tires was the way to go. The track was drying in the racing line, but track position was too important to give away for slicks.\n\nAs it turned out, that worked perfectly, though just barely. Reddick and Christopher Bell elected to take slicks and were visibly much faster than Bowman. But lacking track position, both had to race through traffic to the front. Bell tangled with teammate Martin Truex Jr. and smacked the wall. Reddick was running Bowman down when the clock ran out, and with a little more time would have been close enough to battle for the lead. But he got a little hot and one racing slick stepped into a wet spot. Reddick just brushed the wall enough to slow him down, allowing Bowman to take the win.\n\nMeanwhile, the favorites entering the day were blindsided by the weather and wound up battling for last pace.\n\nAll in all, despite a few spins on the wet tack, the race wasn't pure chaos. It just played that way on TV.\n\nIt's not a road course. It's not really an oval, either. Whatever it is, the Cup Series takes on Pocono Raceway this weekend.\n\nPocono is a challenge because of its layout. A flat triangle with three distinct turns, it's long been the bane of crew chiefs because it usually means sacrificing handling in one corner to be good in another. The massive front straightaway means cars enter the tight confines of turn 1 at extremely high speeds and on several racing lines.\n\nAt 2.5 miles, Pocono also presents a unique pit strategy situation. Some teams will approach it like a road course because a pit stop won't cost a lap or more as it does on most ovals. Stage racing has also added to the strategy dilemma, so the race could well go to a team who plays it right from the pit box.\n\nSome fans were wondering why teams had a tire choice to start the race at Chicago after just a couple of weeks ago, every tire change on wet-weather tires was carefully mandated by NASCAR after rains at New Hampshire.\n\nIt's a different situation. That was the first time NASCAR had ever used those tires mid-race on an oval. It was important to get accurate data on wear and to err on the side of driver safety.\n\nThey've run the tires before on road courses, including this one, so putting things in the hands of teams was a reasonable decision. Teams know what to expect.\n\nGive NASCAR some time with wet tires on ovals and it's likely things will change. Consistency is important, but the two scenarios are far from the same thing. NASCAR has been consistent on road courses, and as long as they progress on ovals, the two just aren't the same sets of circumstances.", "source": {"uri": "frontstretch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Frontstretch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_henderson@frontstretch.com", "name": "Amy Henderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Hand", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joey Hand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFK_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RFK Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_tyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rain tyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Briscoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chase Briscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Xfinity_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Xfinity Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_van_Gisbergen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane van Gisbergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_slick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racing slick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Blaney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Blaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pocono Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Truex_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Truex Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Bell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racing line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://frontstretch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Cup-Chicago-street-pack-racing-VIII-Alex-Bowman-car-Credit-NKP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

But, in living up to his nickname \"The Showman,\" the Tucson-born driver showed out Sunday in an unconventional NASCAR Cup Series race against time to snap a winless drought spanning 80 starts in the second-ever Chicago Street Course event.\n\nFighting his way through the darkness -- both literally and figuratively -- Bowman survived a stormy spectacle through the streets of the Windy City by holding off runner-up finisher Tyler Reddick and trusting in his second-year crew chief Blake Harris, who also scored his first win in 85 attempts calling races at the sport's top level.\n\n\"For me just overcoming everything that's happened in my life in the last two years, it's been really difficult,\" said the now-31-year-old Bowman, who attended Ironwood Ridge High School in Oro Valley. \"I broke my back (in a sprint car accident), had a brain injury and we've kind of sucked ever since. You start to second-guess if you're ever going to get a chance to win a race again.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I'm proud of my guys for being able to shut that out and work hard each and every week and have confidence in the decisions that we make and the race cars that we bring to the racetrack.\n\nMuch like its inaugural event, the Grant Park 165 began under damp conditions, forcing teams to weigh the options between ripping the 2.2-mile street circuit through Downtown Chicago on traditional, \"slick\" racing tires to maximize speed, or wet-weather tires to create more grip and stability through the 12 turns.\n\nAt the conclusion of Stage 1, Bowman, who started eighth, managed to finish sixth before heavy rains put a stop to the race for nearly two hours. With darkness fast approaching, NASCAR informed teams they could only race until 8:20 p.m. local time, in which the white flag would wave and drivers would have a two-lap dash to decide the winner.\n\nAfter completing the second segment, it was determined there would only be 25 minutes left of daylight, eliminating the lap count to the advertised 75-lap distance and setting an unprecedented, timed countdown to the checkered-flag.\n\nWith 12 minutes remaining, Bowman drove around Stage 2 winner and road-course ringer Joey Hand for the lead, and never looked back as he cruised to his first victory since Las Vegas Motor Speedway in March of 2022 -- a return over 850 days in the making.\n\n\"It means a lot to me to be able to overcome a lot and do something that I don't think a lot of people here really would have thought this weekend that we could,\" Bowman added. \"As a human being, I'm just a dude trying to do my job the best I possibly can. I see everything that gets said about me. So, to be able to overcome what I've gone through and to end up back (in victory lane), it feels really good.\"\n\nEntering the Grant Park 165, Bowman was the only driver at Hendrick Motorsports unable to secure a victory in 2024. But the win all but locks him into the playoffs during the powerhouse organization's 40th anniversary season. NASCAR's playoff rounds start in early September, with the 2024 series champion eventually crowned at the season-finale at Phoenix Raceway in Avondale.\n\nOpening up his ninth full-time campaign with a runner-up finish in the Daytona 500, NASCAR's version of the Super Bowl, there was never a doubt in Bowman's ability to be competitive.\n\nWith his win at Chicago, Bowman is now tied for the second-most top-10 finishes in the series with 11. With speed being evident, it was just a matter of putting a complete race together, which was possible with help from Harris atop the pit box.\n\nIn most cases, slick tires enable drivers to produce more speed, hence why drivers like Reddick, third-place finisher Christopher Bell and fellow Arizonan Michael McDowell of Phoenix (fifth) surged to the front in the closing minutes of the race.\n\nHarris, favoring track position over the chance at running the leaders down, kept the wet-weather tires bolted onto the No. 48 Ally Chevrolet Camaro and instructed his driver to run through as many damp parts of the track as possible to keep Reddick at bay.\n\nFor once, wet-weather tires were the winning call, and one made with conviction from Harris.\n\n\"Over the last year and a half, we've been in position to win some races and we just hadn't gotten there,\" Harris said. \"You go in every week ... no matter what's been thrown at us, or things that happened, or where we're at in point scenarios, there's no better answer than getting the win.\n\n\"For myself, I go to all the guys and I tell them, 'Put the pressure on me. Let's go to work. You do your job (and) we're going to get it done.' Eventually (you've) got to deliver on that,\" Harris added. \"I think they've delivered a lot and it was nice to finally be able to deliver the win. Really excited for Alex. I thought he drove a heck of a race today. I felt like we had speed all weekend, and it feels really good.\"\n\nExiting arguably the largest unknown on the circuit, Bowman and Harris overcame multiple adversities to secure their first victory together in thrilling fashion. More importantly, Bowman now is in position make a run once the postseason starts for the sixth time in his career.\n\n\"These guys work so hard,\" NASCAR Hall of Famer and Hendrick Motorsports vice chairman Jeff Gordon said. \"It's important that you gel and the chemistry comes and the effort's there, but you've got to win at some point. You've got to win, not just because you're at Hendrick Motorsports, it's because it's really hard to get the team where they need to be to compete at the highest level on a regular basis to make the playoffs, then compete at a high level in the playoffs.\n\n\"I think today was a huge day for both of these guys and the whole team. I couldn't be more proud or happy for the whole group, because I know what kind of pressure that they've been feeling and it's amazing for all of us now to have all four cars in the playoffs.\"\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Everybody that said I couldn't win and don't deserve to be at Hendrick Motorsports and all that bullshit, cheers to you.\"\n\nThat was literally a mic drop moment at the end of the race winning press conference for Alex Bowman in the aftermath of his triumph in the second NASCAR Cup Series Chicago Street Race.\n\nIf anyone warranted such a mic drop, it's Bowman, given everything that has transpired since his last victory at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in March 2022. There was the concussion suffered in September of that year and then the broken back suffered in a Sprint Car crash last spring.\n\nHe's been healthy to start this season, and while there has been a great deal of consistency, a lengthy winless streak reached 80 until Bowman held off Tyler Reddick on Sunday in the Windy City.\n\nIt wasn't just that he held off Reddick, it's that he did so on blistered wet tires in drying conditions as he was being pursued by one of the best modern road course racers in the game. There was also the pass he needed to make, on equal tires, on road racing ace Joey Hand in the RFK Racing No. 60.\n\nBowman is signed through 2026 but he concedes awareness that his job security is constantly a matter of public question, even if not privately within the halls of Hendrick Motorsports.\n\n\"I broke my back, had a brain injury, and we've kind of sucked ever since, and ... you start to second-guess if you're ever going to get a chance to win a race again,\" Bowman said.\n\nHe was the only driver within the flagship Chevrolet organization to have not yet won this season and that often superseded the 11 top-10s he has recorded, good for second most in the discipline.\n\n\"I think you need to win races whenever you're at HMS. But certainly, nobody has made me feel like I'm on the hot seat. There's never been a single conversation with a single person that has questioned anything to do with that at all. It's all been, what do you need, how can we help you, how can we support the team.\n\n\"That's the great part about Hendrick Motorsports is whatever the noise is outside, everybody inside is never going to tear each other down. They're always going to be supportive.\"\n\nBowman is a really popular figure inside the company, with his peers respecting the unorthodox path he took to reach one of the top seats in the Cup Series in the first place, having basically accepted a reserve driver role within the company years ago until a seat opened up.\n\nHe never had the money to buy a ride and simply did whatever it took to be deserving of such a chance.\n\nThus, when he broke his back last year racing a Sprint Car completely unrelated to his NASCAR duties, that is what left him the most disappointed in himself -- that he let down the company that invested so much into him.\n\n\"I remember when I got to the hospital in Iowa sitting there, like, knowing that something was wrong and the doctor came in and he's like, 'I have great news, your neck is totally fine but you broke your back,' and just feeling like I let my whole team down, like I let Ally down and Mr. Hendrick down.\n\n\"Like the concussion stuff, we blow a tire running a Cup car, that's so different than breaking your back going and doing your hobby, right? That felt pretty self-inflicted and I spent my 30th birthday in the hospital in Burlington, Iowa. It was not a lot of fun.\n\n\"That was tough. I felt like I let them down. But the first thing Mr. Hendrick said is, 'we'll get through it and whatever you need we're going to get you help with,' and everybody was so incredibly supportive.\n\nSo Bowman has just been driven ever since to reward that support and loyalty with what came on Sunday. That's especially true given two years of regret he had carried with him.\n\n\"Gosh, the last Cup race I won, I remember we were in Vegas and we had won a lot pretty recently to that and we all landed at like 4:00, and every other race we had celebrated and had so much fun with the team and we were all kind of like,' nah, it's too late, we don't need to celebrate, we'll celebrate the next one or whatever,' and I have regretted that ever since, obviously, so that is not going to happen tonight.\n\nBut as a human being, I'm just a dude trying to do my job the best I possibly can, and I see everything that gets said about me. So to be able to overcome what I've gone through and to end up back here, it feels really good.\n\n\"I didn't need it. There's certainly a lot in my life that I don't need but I'm just appreciative of it and everyone.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_weaver@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Matt Weaver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_car_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint car racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFK_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RFK Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Hand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joey Hand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NASCAR-Grant-Park-165-23699593.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

At the conclusion of the second stage period, the event became a race against the clock to conclude at 8:20 p.m. CT instead of its scheduled distance of 75 laps due to an earlier rain delay period that spanned more than an hour and a half.\n\nFor the start of the final stage period with 27 laps remaining, Bowman, who was among several front-runners who elected to continue to race on wet tires instead of dry slicks for the remainder of the event following a strategic call made by crew chief Harris, assumed the lead from Hand with 26 laps remaining. Then amid another late-race caution that gave him more time to lead as the event's timed clock to conclusion kept expiring, he muscled away from the field during the next restart period with 22 laps remaining and led the next two laps before the event was then shortened to two laps remaining (75 to 58 laps overall) as the clock expired. Despite having Tyler Reddick challenging him over the final two laps, Bowman left little room to error around the Chicago Street Course's 12 turns and he managed to fend off the competition to snap an 80-race winless drought and lock both himself and his No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet team into this year's Playoff field.\n\nWith on-track qualifying that determined the starting lineup on Saturday, July 6, Kyle Larson notched his fifth Cup pole position of the 2024 season after posting a 90.168 mph lap in 87.836 seconds. Joining him on the front row was Ty Gibbs, who clocked in the second-fastest qualifying lap at 90.158 mph in 87.846 seconds.\n\nBefore the event, several drivers including Brad Keselowski, Corey LaJoie, Ryan Blaney, Chris Buescher, Harrison Burton, Ryan Preece and Erik Jones dropped to the rear of the field due to unapproved adjustments to their respective entries. William Byron also started at the rear of the field due to a power steering failure. Notably, Josh Bilicki, who started at the rear of the field, was not permitted to qualify and was assessed a drive-through penalty at the start of the event due to his entry failing pre-race inspection three times.\n\nWith rain occurring around the course as the field made the pace laps, the teams were given the option to switch from slick to wet weather tires. Select names including Austin Cindric, Austin Dillon, Corey LaJoie, Ryan Blaney, Martin Truex Jr., Joey Logano and rookie Zane Smith pitted for wet tires while the rest led by Larson and Gibbs remained on the track on dry weather tires.\n\nWhen the green flag waved and the event commenced, the field fanned out through the frontstretch amid a series of tire spins as Ty Gibbs launched his No. 54 Monster Energy Toyota Camry XSE ahead with the early advantage through Turn 1. Gibbs proceeded to lead from Turns 2 to 5 while Tyler Reddick tried to close in from the runner-up spot. With the field then navigating through a long straightaway in South Columbus Drive, Gibbs retained the lead through the next series of turns starting in Turn 6 to East Balbo Drive to South Michigan Drive and the East Congress Plaza Drive through Turns 7 to 11. Through one final right-hand turn to Turn 12, Gibbs led the first lap over Reddick.\n\nThrough the second lap, Gibbs slightly stretched his early advantage to more than half a second over Reddick as Kyle Larson, who lost the lead at the start, tried to challenge Reddick for the runner-up spot. Behind, Alex Bowman was trying to fend off Shane van Gisbergen and Bubba Wallace for fourth place before van Gisbergen overtook both Bowman and Larson to move his No. 16 Wendy's Saucy Nuggets Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 up to third place.\n\nMeanwhile, Truex had carved his way up to 10th place after pitting for wet tires as he tried to close in on Chase Briscoe for more while Christopher Bell and Michael McDowell were in seventh and eighth. With a series of on-course battles ensuing between those who pitted for wet tires versus those who did not, Gibbs retained the lead by a second over Reddick by the fifth lap mark. By then, McDowell, Ryan Preece and Harrison Burton pitted their respective entries for wet tires as rain was being reported within the north end of the circuit.\n\nAt the Lap 10 mark, Gibbs, who remained on the course on dry tires, continued to lead by seven-tenths of a second over a hard-charging van Gisbergen as Bell, Larson and Briscoe followed suit in the top five. Behind, Reddick, Bubba Wallace, Alex Bowman, John Hunter Nemechek and Todd Gilliland trailed in the top 10 while Ross Chastain, Daniel Suarez, Chase Elliott, Kyle Busch, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., AJ Allmendinger, rookie Carson Hocevar, Joey Hand, Justin Haley and Kaz Grala rounded out the top 20 ahead of Chris Buescher, Austin Hill, Denny Hamlin, Brad Keselowski and Daniel Hemric. By then, select names including LaJoie, Austin Dillon and Truex had pitted.\n\nA lap later, Gibbs, who was stuck behind Preece and Joey Logano as the latter two were struggling on wet tires and trying to remain on the lead lap, was overtaken by van Gisbergen for the lead through the South Michigan Avenue and entering Turn 11. With van Gisbergen leading through the frontstretch and at the Lap 12 mark, Bell would also try to follow suit in his No. 20 Craftsman Toyota Camry XSE, but Gibbs would fend him off as Bell bumped and nearly sent Logano sideways in Turn 1. With Ricky Stenhouse Jr. spinning in Turn 1 while the event remained under green flag conditions, select names including Burton, Logano, Preece, Erik Jones, Cindric and McDowell were lapped as van Gisbergen stretched his advantage to a second over Bell by Lap 14. Bell, however, would assume the lead from van Gisbergen on Lap 15.\n\nA lap later, the event's first caution period flew due to LaJoie, who was scored in 29th place, spinning and crashing his No. 7 Celsius Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 into the wall in Turn 5 as he was dodged by oncoming traffic, including the leader, while faced backward. By then, van Gisbergen had reassumed the lead from Bell as Gibbs, Briscoe and Larson were running in the top five.\n\nWith the precipitation slowly increasing around the circuit, the first stage period scheduled to conclude on Lap 20 concluded under caution as van Gisbergen claimed the first Cup stage victory of his career and of the 2024 season. Bell, who swept both stage periods a year ago at the streets of Chicago, settled in second ahead of Gibbs, Briscoe and Larson while Bowman, Wallace, Gilliland, Reddick and Suarez were scored in the top 10. By then, 30 of 40 competitors were scored on the lead lap as William Byron, LaJoie, Ryan Blaney and rookie Josh Berry were pinned a lap down.\n\nDuring the closing laps of the first stage period, NASCAR announced that the event's conclusion would occur at 8:20 p.m. CT, even if the event did not reach its scheduled distance of Lap 75, which made the event a race against the clock for the scheduled time. Once the event's leader crosses the start/finish line at the time when the clock expires, the next lap will be the final lap and the checkered flag will follow suit with no overtime rules occurring.\n\nUnder the stage break, nearly the entire field led by van Gisbergen, including those on dry tires, pitted for wet tires while Zane Smith remained on the track. Following the pit stops, where the field stacked up upon exiting pit road to avoid an on-track safety vehicle, Bell exited first while Gibbs, Larson, van Gisbergen, Bowman, Wallace, Briscoe and Reddick, who ran into the rear of teammate Wallace, followed suit.\n\nThe second stage period started on Lap 23 as Smith and Bell occupied the front row. At the start, Gibbs managed to overtake both to reassume the lead in Turn 1. Shortly after, Wallace, who was battling in the top 10, spun at the exit of Turn 2 after Bowman made contact with Wallace's No. 23 McDonald's Toyota Camry XSE, which resulted in Wallace making rear-end contact with the tire barriers and sliding back into the path of both Bowman and Suarez.\n\nAs the field continued to navigate through the course, the caution would then return just shy of Lap 25 due to Briscoe sliding sideways amid the slick conditions and slamming into the tire barriers on the driver's side of the No. 14 Mahindra Tractors Ford Mustang Dark Horse in Turn 6 while also clipping van Gisbergen as both were racing in the top six. In the process, van Gisbergen slid and slammed into the outside wall on the right side in Turn 6 and came to a full stop towards the wall. The incident was enough for van Gisbergen to retire from competition as his hopes of winning on the streets of Chicago for a second consecutive season evaporated.\n\n\"I just sort of turned in [to Turn 6], it looked pretty good and then just got smashed by [Briscoe],\" van Gisbergen said upon being released from the infield care center on NBC. \"Gutting. That sucks, but it's an unfortunate mistake by him. I'm sure he didn't mean it, but yeah, when he just clipped me, ain't nothing I could do. It's a shame to be out so early and shame we couldn't have a proper crack at [the win] at the end.\"\n\nDuring the caution period, the field led by Gibbs was directed to pit road and the race was placed in a red flag period for one hour and 43 minutes due to the rain as the on-track crews went to work to blow the standing water off of the course.\n\nOnce the field led by Gibbs returned to the course under a cautious pace, some including Byron, Erik Jones, Suarez, Logano, LaJoie, Preece and Burton pitted for a fresh set of wet tires. By then, the race had approximately an hour before it would reach its scheduled time of concluding at 8:20 p.m. CT.\n\nWhen the race restarted on Lap 30, where all competitors restarted in single-line formation, Gibbs retained the lead from teammate Bell through the first turn before navigating his way from Turns 2 to 5. Then through the South Columbus Drive, Bell drew even with teammate Gibbs before he gained the advantage and moved into the lead in Turn 6. With Denny Hamlin locking his tires and running into the rear of Stenhouse as both spun and hit the tire barriers in Turn 6, the race remained under green flag conditions as Bell retained the lead over teammate Gibbs over the next four laps. In the process, Larson began to ignite his challenge on Gibbs for the runner-up spot while Reddick and Gilliland carved their way into the top five over Nemechek, Elliott, Chastain, Allmendinger and Smith.\n\nThen on Lap 33 and with Bell stretching his advantage to more than a second, the caution flew after Larson, who was battling Gibbs for the runner-up spot, locked up his front tires and went dead straight into the tire barriers in Turn 6 as he got his No. 5 Valvoline Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 stuck underneath the barriers. With the assistance of a wrecker, Larson limped his car that had heavy front nose damage as far as he could around the course, starting from Turn 6, before he parked his car in Turn 8 and retired from further competition.\n\nThe start of the next restart period on Lap 36 featured Bell retaining the lead over teammate Gibbs, Reddick and Gilliland through the first two turns. With seventh-place Chastain barely hitting the wall in Turn 4, trouble struck as Josh Berry hit the tire barriers head-on in Turn 4. In the ensuing process, teammate Briscoe spun off the course in the exact same turn, but both continued without drawing a caution. Amid the chaos, Bell slowly stretched his advantage to more than half a second over teammate Gibbs during the ensuing four laps.\n\nJust past the Lap 40 mark, Bell retained the lead by eight-tenths of a second over teammate Gibbs while third-place Gilliland trailed by four seconds. Behind, Nemechek and Reddick were in the top five as Allmendinger, Joey Hand, Chastain, Bowman and Justin Haley were in the top 10 ahead of Buescher, Grala, Keselowski, Austin Dillon and Elliott.\n\nWith three laps remaining in the second stage period and with nearly half an hour of racing left on the clock, select names including Austin Dillon, Kyle Busch, Elliott, Austin Hill, McDowell, Blaney, Byron, Zane Smith, Cindric, Suarez and Wallace pitted their respective entries for slick tires. Teammates Bell and Gibbs along with Gilliland, Nemechek, Reddick, Allmendinger, Chastain, Haley, Buescher and Grala all pitted for dry tires during the next lap as Joey Hand cycled into the lead. In the process, Austin Dillon and Berry had on-track incidents of their own within separate turns, but the event remained under green flag conditions.\n\nWhen the second stage period concluded on Lap 45, Joey Hand, an accomplished sports car competitor from Sacramento, California, who was making his first NASCAR start of the 2024 season in Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing's No. 60 Ford Mustang Dark Horse entry, captured the stage victory, which was also his first in the Cup Series level. Bowman followed suit in second along with Keselowski, Hocevar and Truex while Noah Gragson, Daniel Hemric, Stenhouse, Burton and Hamlin were scored in the top 10. By then and with the top-10 competitors all remaining on the track on wet tires, Bell was mired in 13th place, but running two spots ahead of teammate Gibbs on his slick tires while Gilliland, Reddick, Nemechek, Allmendinger and Haley were mired within the top 20 on the course.\n\nWith 27 laps remaining but less than 20 minutes left until the event reached its concluding time of 8:20 p.m. CT, the final stage commenced as Hand, who along with the rest of the field remained on the track during the second stage's break period, led Bowman, Keselowski, Hocevar, Truex and the rest of the field through the frontstretch. At the start, Hand retained a slim lead in his No. 60 BuildSumbarines.com Ford Mustang Dark Horse over Bowman through the first two turns while Truex was trying to overtake Hocevar for fourth place. Hand would was lead through Turns 2 to 5 and through South Columbus Drive before he made his way into Turn 6 with the top spot. Behind, Keselowski retained third place ahead of Truex, Hocevar and Stenhouse just past Turn 6 while Hand maintained the lead by within half a second as he led the proceeding lap.\n\nDown to the final 25 laps of the event, Hand continued to lead by two-tenths of a second over a hard-charging Bowman, who kept intimidating Hand through every turn, as Keselowski, Truex and Hocevar followed suit in the top five. Meanwhile, Bell, racing on slick tires, was mired in 11th place behind Stenhouse, Gragson, Hemric, Burton and Preece while Gibbs, Reddick, Briscoe and Nemechek were in the top 15 ahead of Berry, McDowell, Gilliland, Blaney and Hamlin. In the process, Allmendinger was recovering from spinning in Turn 12 without drawing a caution.\n\nThen just as Bowman assumed the lead from Hand in Turn 5 and was entering South Columbus Drive during the following lap, the caution returned due to Berry wrecking and getting his No. 4 Overstock.com Ford Mustang Dark Horse stuck underneath the tire barriers.\n\nWith 22 laps but four-and-a-half minutes on the clock remaining, the race restarted as Bowman retained the lead ahead of Hand and the field through the first turn. Amid a strong start, Bowman retained a steady advantage through the next set of turns while Briscoe and Nemechek each wrecked separately. As the race continued to run under green flag conditions, Bell muscled his way up to eighth place behind Hocevar and Gragson while Bowman retained the lead entering Turn 6 before he navigated his way through Turns 7 to 11.\n\nThe following lap, Truex got sideways in Turn 2 and he got teammate Bell, who was about to crack the top five, spinning sideways in front of Hocevar as both Bell and Hocevar collided into one another towards the wall. Despite all competitors continuing without drawing a caution, Bell's progress to drive back to the front was derailed as he pitted and eventually retired from the race. In the process, Bowman kept his No. 48 Ally Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 out in front of the field while running strong on his wet tires.\n\nThen as the time clock expired and the event's duration decreased from 20 to two laps remaining, Bowman continued to lead by more than a second over Hand as Reddick, Gibbs and Stenhouse trailed in the top five. Reddick, who was on slick tires, would proceed to overtake Hand for the runner-up spot, but he trailed Bowman by more than three seconds.\n\nWhen the white flag waved and the final lap started, Bowman remained as the leader by two seconds over Reddick, who was mounting a late charge on slick tires and logging in faster lap times than Bowman. With Reddick hitting the inside wall in Turn 5 and losing ground amid his late-race charge, Bowman was able to navigate the final seven sets of turns within the streets of Chicago smoothly and to perfection as he returned to the frontstretch victorious for his first checkered flag in over two years.\n\nWith the victory, Bowman achieved his eighth career win in the NASCAR Cup Series division, his first on a road course and street course venue and his first since winning at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in March 2022. The victory was also the first for crew chief Blake Harris, who assumed the role as crew chief of the No. 48 Ally/Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet team at the start of the 2023 season. In addition, Bowman's victory for Hendrick Motorsports' No. 48 team, which was the eighth of the season for the Hendrick organization and the ninth for the Chevrolet nameplate through 20-scheduled events, means that team owner Rick Hendrick has all four of his entries making the Playoffs and for the first time since the 2022 season.\n\nBowman's victory was also a redemptive moment for the Arizona native, whose championship hopes in 2022 evaporated when he wrecked at Texas Motor Speedway during the Round of 12 opener. The incident resulted in Bowman sustaining a concussion and missing five of the final six events of the schedule and also eliminated him from the Playoffs following the Round of 12. He then suffered a back injury following a sprint car accident in late April that forced him to miss three regular-season races in 2023 and resulted in him missing the 2023 Playoffs. The 2024 season will mark Bowman's sixth time overall being a participant in the Playoffs in NASCAR's premier series.\n\n\"Anytime you go to the racetrack with Hendrick Motorsports, you got a shot [at winning],\" Bowman said on NBC. \"We have a trophy to take home. [I] Know it means a lot to this team. They put me in position to win the race. Man, I broke my back, had a brain injury and we kind of sucked ever since. You start to second-guess if you're ever gonna get a chance to win a race again. Last one we won, we really didn't get to celebrate. We're gonna drink so much damn bourbon tonight. It's gonna be a bad deal. I'm probably gonna wake up naked on the bathroom floor again, but that's the part of this deal sometimes. Excited to get home. It's gonna be a good night.\"\n\nTyler Reddick charged his No. 45 Jordan Brand Toyota Camry XSE to a runner-up result for his eighth top-five result of the 2024 season while Ty Gibbs charged his way up to third place on slick tires and for his fifth top-five result of the season. Joey Hand notched a career-best fourth place while Michael McDowell came home in fifth place.\n\nRicky Stenhouse Jr., Todd Gilliland, William Byron, Kyle Busch and Ryan Blaney completed the top 10 in the final running order.\n\nNotably, Bubba Wallace, who ran into the side of Bowman after the race to express his displeasure over being spun by Bowman earlier in the race, rallied to finish 13th behind Daniel Suarez and Daniel Hemric. In addition, Brad Keselowski slipped to 18th, Chase Elliott ended up 21st behind Chris Buescher but ahead of Ross Chastain and Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin ended up 30th after he wrecked with Austin Hill into the tire barriers with two laps remaining and Martin Truex Jr. ended up 33rd following his late-race wreck. In addition, Christopher Bell, who was unable to finish, ended up 37th.\n\nThere were nine lead changes for six different leaders. The race featured five cautions for 19 laps. In addition, 34 of 40 starters finished on the lead lap.\n\nFollowing the 20th event of the 2024 Cup Series season, Kyle Larson continues to lead the regular-season standings by 11 points over teammate Chase Elliott, 23 over Tyler Reddick, 42 over Denny Hamlin, 70 over Martin Truex Jr. and 72 over William Byron.\n\n40. Shane van Gisbergen - OUT, nine laps led, Stage 1 winner\n\nNext on the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series schedule is Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, for The Great American Getaway 400.

On the wet streets of 'The Windy City', the driver of the #48 car finally had his redemption. He ended a winless run that had spanned 80 races. The Hendrick Motorsports star shut a lot of doubters up with that victory. In a media interaction after the race, he addressed those who questioned his worth all this while.\n\nIn the 20 races he has started, the driver of the #48 Chevrolet has earned one win, five top-five, and 11 top-10 finishes. His recent result will give him a lot of confidence going into the rest of the season. As far as his team is concerned, they finally have all four drivers in the final 16.\n\n\"We all see the things that get said, whether it's media people second guessing or the internet second guessing us,\" he said as per Speedway Digest. \"It's hard to go to work every day when you get talked about like that sometimes. So, I am proud of these guys for overcoming that.\"\n\nIt was undoubtedly an impressive win, but not a clean one. However, fellow racer Bubba Wallace was not pleased with the HMS star. After the event, as Bowman was celebrating, the 23XI Racing driver nudged him into the wall.\n\nIt was retribution for an incident that had taken place earlier in the race. The HMS star lost control of his car for a moment and tagged the #23. This caused Wallace to spin around on the wet track and ruined his race. He ended up finishing in P13. Subsequently, Bowman admitted his mistake after the race and took full responsibility.\n\n\"I ruined his day. The restart was chaotic. I just made every wrong decision that I possibly could. I was fighting with my windshield wiper switch trying to get it working and I couldn't get it working. I was focused on that, missed the corner,\" he told NBC Sports.\n\nThe #48 team desperately needed to win in the regular season.

Through six races, his average finish was 7.0, and he had recorded three top five finishes and an additional two top 10 finishes.\n\nBut three races later, he found himself sidelined with a broken back from a sprint car crash. When he returned, it took him 11 races to finish inside the top 10, and he did not qualify for the playoffs.\n\nNow in 2024, Bowman's average finish of 13.8 is the best of his career, and it's only just behind Larson's (13.7) and Byron's (13.3). Bowman has already recorded five top five finishes, and his 11 top 10 finishes are tied for the team lead with Byron. He is on pace for career-highs in both categories.\n\nHe's far from flashy, but he continues to get the job done, something he knows he needs to do as long as he's competing for Hendrick's team. And it's something he should continue to get the opportunity to do, considering the fact that his contract is nowhere near its expiration date and there has never been any reason to believe the team will cut ties with him prematurely.", "source": {"uri": "beyondtheflag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beyond the Flag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Street_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Street Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Financial", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ally Financial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Hendrick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Hendrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byron_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Byron (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_car_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint car racing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2389,h_1343,x_0,y_26/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/243/01j29z3y395eytna21hf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The cars made contact and Bowman's car hit a concrete barrier hard enough to briefly lift his right front tire off the ground.\n\nAn in-car camera shot showed an unprepared Bowman, who had his window net already dropped, getting jostled and then putting his hands up in a \"what the...?\" gesture.\n\nBowman later said he did not think Wallace should be penalized for the incident and repeatedly expressed remorse for the earlier crash which infuriated Wallace (who had been trying to race his way into NASCAR's playoffs with Bowman as one of his primary competitors).\n\n\"I was fighting with my windshield wiper switch trying to get the thing working,\" Bowman said. \"I was focused on that, missed the corner and cleaned him out. I just messed up and absolutely ruined his day.\n\n\"He has every right to be mad; I'd be mad, too. I tried to call him during the rain delay and I shot him a text. Nothing I can do to make it better, and I'm sure us winning probably only makes it worse.\"\n\nBowman added Wallace \"barely hit me\" and it was \"plenty deserved.\" But NASCAR officials saw it differently, because they viewed it as enough of a safety concern to issue a penalty.\n\nThere is a precedent for an angry driver being penalized after slamming his car into the race winner. In 2006, Dale Earnhardt Jr. spun out Carl Edwards during an Xfinity Series race at Michigan and Edwards then retaliated by driving into Earnhardt's door while the driver's hand was out the window. Edwards was fined $20,000 and issued an apology.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the dollar amount is largely inconsequential. Consider it a slap on the wrist.\n\nBut by fining Wallace, what NASCAR did was send a reminder that safety is paramount. To allow drivers to make intentional contact with one another after the race that sends a competitor into the wall -- regardless of how minimal the contact is -- sends the wrong kind of message, a potential catalyst for something consequential.\n\nThis penalty is NASCAR's equivalent of writing a traffic ticket to remind drivers that safety must always be top of mind.\n\nDrivers often put down their window nets and undue their safety belts on a cool-down lap, thereby creating a scenario where someone could get hurt. Sure, it may be unlikely, but all it takes is one avoidable situation for NASCAR to have a mess on its hands.\n\nIf drivers have an issue with one another, there's a better way to handle it than on the cool-down lap.\n\nWhat is confusing, though, is why Chase Elliott did essentially the same thing -- minus sending Daniel Suarez into the wall. Was that really the difference between Wallace getting penalized, while Elliott escaped? The two incidents are too close for one to get slapped while the other doesn't. -- Jordan Bianchi, motorsports writer", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_gluck@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeff Gluck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jordan_bianchi@nytimes.com", "name": "Jordan Bianchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Xfinity_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Xfinity Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Earnhardt_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dale Earnhardt Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seat belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/09203916/gettyimages-2160577268-594x594-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt took Alex Bowman over two years and 80 starts to win his eighth NASCAR Cup Series race. That's a long winless run for someone associated with a powerhouse team like Hendrick Motorsports. During this time, there have been rumors circulating about the team wanting to replace the #48 driver. NASCAR is a results-based business and HMS demands victories from each of its drivers.\n\nIn a media interaction after the Chicago Street race, the 31-year-old said that the HMS driver never focused on the noise going on outside. Inside the shop, efforts were being made to help the #48 team as much as possible. They reaped the rewards of those efforts on Sunday as the team confirmed its full lineup in the playoffs.\n\n\"Certainly nobody has made me feel like I'm on the hot seat,\" Bowman said as per Speedway Digest. \"There's never been a single conversation with a single person that has questioned anything to do with that at all.\"\n\nThe team's vice-chairman Jeff Gordon understands the rumors. HMS is the winningest organization in NASCAR history, hence it's understandable why rumors of Bowman's replacement would be floating around. For one of its drivers to not win a race in over two years doesn't paint the correct picture following the team's reputation. Meanwhile, Gordon hopes that the win at the Chicago Street Race will do away with these rumors for the time being.\n\n\"When you're at Hendrick Motorsports, you do expect, especially when the other three have won, to be in that same category, and it hasn't been happening. Hopefully, this dispels a lot of the rumors,\" he said.\n\nWith a win under his belt and a confirmed spot in the playoffs, Bowman will have a lot of confidence moving forward. It will be interesting to see how the #48 driver performs in the remaining regular season races.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nilavro_ghosh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Nilavro Ghosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avondale,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avondale, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Avondale, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedway,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speedway, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Speedway, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/3e456b15-untitled-design-77.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

If Tyler Reddick doesn't end up in the Championship 4 this season, this current stretch of races in particular may come back to haunt him.\n\nFor three weeks in a row, Reddick has seen seemingly certain victories slip right through his fingers. He had New Hampshire all but won by banking on strategy and rain ending the race, but things didn't work out as the rain stopped and set up a wet weather conclusion to the race. He was on a tear on the final restart at Nashville and had the race all but won, but a well-timed air block by Joey Logano prevented him from doing so. And if that wasn't frustrating enough, there was the self-inflicted error of the Chicago Street Course.\n\nPossessing a prohibitive advantage with slick tires on a dry racetrack vs. leader Alex Bowman's wet weather tires on the final lap, Reddick was making up extreme amounts of time and likely would have caught and passed Bowman for the victory -- until an unforced error saw him clip the inside wall between Turns 4 and 5, breaking his momentum and causing him to lose ground and be forced to settle for second.\n\nDespite yet another missed opportunity to win, Reddick's recent performances combined with a DNF for Kyle Larson has given him the top spot in this week's CBS Sports NASCAR Power Rankings. Reddick jumps up ahead of Christopher Bell, who may very well have retaken the Power Rankings lead this week had it not been for a late-race crash while he was trying to make his way through traffic that cost him a chance to win Chicago himself.\n\nHere's a look at CBS Sports' latest NASCAR Power Rankings:\n\nRankDriverChangeComment1Tyler ReddickPerhaps Pocono will be the track where Tyler Reddick can get over the hump and get his second win of the 2024 season. He's finished second there two years in a row, including a year ago when he finished runner-up to Denny Hamlin after leading 15 laps.\n\n2Christopher Bell--Alex Bowman was arguably even more fortunate to have misfortune befall Christopher Bell than to have Tyler Reddick make his mistake on the last lap. Bell was ahead of Reddick on slicks and had far more time to catch Bowman, but he got spun and crashed while trying to work through traffic to get to third.\n\n3Kyle LarsonThe tire barriers in Turn 6 did their job, as the impact Kyle Larson had could have been much worse had the tire barriers not blunted his impact. Larson went into the barrier at full speed after missing the corner and almost cleaning out Ty Gibbs in the process.\n\n4Ryan Blaney--Pocono will always be a special place for Ryan Blaney, as he picked up his very first Cup win there back in 2017. He's one of just four drivers ever to get his first win at Pocono, a group that includes Jeremy Mayfield (1998), Denny Hamlin (2016) and Chris Buescher (2016).\n\n5Chase ElliottDespite Kyle Larson's crash, Chase Elliott was unable to capitalize and take the regular-season points lead back over at Chicago thanks in part to getting spun by Daniel Suarez on the final lap. The two were seen after the race having a frank discussion about the contact after Elliott finished 21st.\n\n6Chris BuescherChris Buescher got his first Cup win at Pocono in 2016 thanks to him being out front when heavy fog ended the race early, but he's had to pay The Tricky Triangle back for that -- with interest -- ever since. His only top 10 at Pocono since his win there was in 2020 when he finished 10th.\n\n7Ross ChastainTrackhouse Racing did a funny sketch where Ross Chastain tried to placate a watermelon that was upset Chastain was racing a peach car at Chicago, but I was left with some dark thoughts after Chastain said they would celebrate just like they always do if he won. Does that mean that Ross has been smashing the same melon every time he wins and the melon just regenerates after being splattered and eaten?\n\n8Joey Logano--Joey Logano only has one career win at Pocono, but it was an important one. After a rocky start to his Cup career, Logano earned a breakthrough Pocono win in 2012, where he outdueled none other than Mark Martin for the victory in the closing laps.\n\n9Todd GillilandMaybe I'm getting ahead of myself here, but if Todd Gilliland keeps running the way he is right now, I wouldn't completely discount the possibility of him making noise in the last few races before the playoffs start. Gilliland ran 15th at Pocono a year ago.\n\n10Alex BowmanInterestingly, Alex Bowman can now say that he's the only driver to have won a NASCAR race on both sides of town in Chicago. Bowman got his very first Cup win at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet back in 2019, the last race to date on that circuit.\n\n11Justin Haley--Justin Haley just missed out on yet another top-15 finish in Chicago, running a solid and steady race on his way to finishing 16th. He's still looking for his first top-20 finish at Pocono, where he has a best result of 21st in 2022.\n\n12William ByronThanks to Alex Bowman's win at Chicago, all four Hendrick Motorsports drivers have now been to Victory Lane in 2024, marking the third time that's happened in the last four seasons that's occurred. Prior to 2021, all four Hendrick drivers had won in a single year just five times (2003, 2006, 2007, 2012, 2014) since the team expanded to four cars beginning in 2002.\n\n13Brad KeselowskiPocono has been the site of some very impressive drives over the years, with one of the most impressive being Brad Keselowski's win there in August 2011. Keselowski won that day despite having broken his ankle in a testing crash at Road Atlanta just days before.\n\n14Ty GibbsA third-place finish at Chicago gave Ty Gibbs his fifth top-five finish of the season, exceeding his season total from 2023 and giving him a new career-high in that category. With one more top 10, he'll match his 2023 output in that category.\n\n15Ricky Stenhouse Jr.With a sixth-place finish at Chicago, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. has now earned three top-10 finishes in his last four starts this season. He has only one top 10 in his career at Pocono, but it just so happened to come last season when he finished seventh.\n\n16Noah GragsonRemember the Chicago Street Race in 2023, when Noah Gragson kept hitting the Turn 6 barrier to the point that it almost felt like the sort of bit you'd see at Second City? Well, a lot of drivers ended up in the barrier in Turn 6 this year -- but not Gragson. He finished 14th.\n\n17Michael McDowellPalette cleanser indeed: Michael McDowell had a strong run at Chicago, finishing fifth in his Chicago White Sox Ford. That's about as good as anything to do with the White Sox has looked all season, as they boast the worst record in baseball at 26-67.\n\n18Daniel SuarezThis isn't to say that he's completely at fault for everything that's occurred, but that's now two out of the last four races in which Daniel Suarez has run into someone he's going to have to deal with in the playoffs. First it was Kyle Larson at Iowa, and now it's Chase Elliott.\n\n19Martin Truex Jr.Another week, another late race development that sees Martin Truex Jr. plummet through the finishing order. He was running in the top five late at Chicago before spinning and finishing 33rd.\n\n20Bubba WallaceIf you follow me on Twitter (@STaranto92, please and thanks) you've seen that I take Anime acrylic keychains with me to the racetrack and make sure to take some sort of photo with them. In light of Bubba Wallace's Jujutsu Kaisen paint scheme at Chicago, some are saying I started a revolution.\n\n21Austin CindricAustin Cindric earned a 15th-place finish for the second week in a row at Chicago, improving his stat line just a tad as he looks for more consistent good finishes to go with his win at Gateway. He's won at Pocono before in the Xfinity Series, but he's never been better than 23rd in two Cup starts there.\n\n22Daniel HemricWhen Daniel Hemric has run well and had good finishes this season, they've habitually come in clusters for him. A 12th at Chicago marked Hemric's second-straight finish inside the top 12.\n\n23Josh BerryAs he looks ahead to a continued career in Cup in 2025, road courses present an easy area for Josh Berry to try and improve on. In three road races this year, Berry has finished 32nd or worse in all of them.\n\n24Zane Smith--Thanks to some wet weather tire strategy, Zane Smith wound up leading three laps at Chicago to lead a Cup race for only the second time in his career. He went on to finish 17th, marking the second week in a row that he's been the top finishing rookie.\n\n25Denny HamlinA return to Pocono couldn't come at a better time for Denny Hamlin, the track's all-time winningest driver with seven victories. After a mess of a day at Chicago, Hamlin has now finished better than 24th just once in the last five races.\n\n26Kyle BuschThe meteor finally didn't hit! No one needed an uneventful day at Chicago more than Kyle Busch, and he got it with a ninth-place finish and his first top 10 in two full months.\n\n27Chase BriscoeHis slide into the Turn 6 barrier that took out Shane van Gisbergen as collateral damage overshadowed the fact that Chase Briscoe was having yet another strong run. He had driven up into the top five from 22nd starting spot early before conditions deteriorated at the start of Stage 2.\n\n28Carson HocevarCarson Hocevar was in the wrong place at the right time in the closing laps at Chicago. He was on his way to a top-10 finish and potentially even a top five before Christopher Bell got turned right in front of him, putting him in the wall and relegating him to 24th.\n\n29Ryan PreeceAfter a deflating performance at Chicago coming off a fourth-place run at Nashville, Ryan Preece had quite the quote to sum up his day (per Frontstretch's Bryan Nolen): \"We got wrecked and then the race was over.\"\n\n30Corey LaJoieFrom a production and storytelling standpoint, I'm of the opinion that more mic'd up drivers/teams (beyond just the team communications) would add a lot to NASCAR. You didn't need a mic to hear the amount of F bombs that Corey LaJoie dropped after he wrecked his car in Chicago qualifying.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS

There was Taco Bell and pizza here when we got home. Chloe had us hooked up when we got home, which was good. We kind of just hung out, had a good time drinking. Everybody ended up in the pool at some point.\"\n\nBowman continued: \"I ended up in the pool with all my clothes on, shoes and everything. To be honest with you, last night when I was trying to live my life and eat some food, I ordered some DoorDash, and I went to the front door, and all of somebody's clothes were on my front porch.\"\n\nBowman's partying story led to Earnhardt sharing a funny story of a celebration he had after earning a victory at Martinsville. \"We're rocking out, we're playing music or whatever,\" Earnhardt began. \"Well, they had a replay of the race they were running on I guess whatever network it was. They just decided to play the race over, so we got that on the TV. We're watching it a little bit and things are happening in the race like people are running over each other, spinning each other out.\n\n\"My teammate at the time, Casey Khane, was at the house partying with us, drinking with us. And this is the Martinsville race where him and [Brian] Vickers got into it. When that came on and we started all reacting to it, whatever our reaction was (I didn't think it was bad) pissed off Casey, and he left, right then and there left the freaking party.\"\n\nBowman had every right to have a big celebration as it was his first win in 80 races. The victory also clinches Bowman a spot in the Cup Series playoffs which begin on Sept. 8.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_jones@on3.com", "name": "Brian Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Earnhardt_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dale Earnhardt Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinsville_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martinsville Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Bell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taco Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/10153718/Alex-Bowman-Dale-Earnhardt-jr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-08", "textStart": 2095, "textEnd": 2102}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Sunday's race saw Alex Bowman earn his first victory of the season, which means 12 drivers have now qualified for the playoffs.\n\nBowman had a strong showing in Chicago, but it was the driver that finished second that has earned the top spot on the NBC Sports Power Rankings. Below is a look at the 10 best NASCAR drivers heading into Sunday's Pocono race.\n\nTyler Reddick just missed out on beating Bowman for the win on Sunday, but he's been on a roll, finishing in the top three in the last two races. He's looking to win his first Cup Series title after finishing sixth in the standings last year.\n\nChristopher Bell is having a very strong year as he's one of four drivers to win at least three races this year. He drops one spot in the rankings because he has finished 36th and 37th in the last two races. This year, Bell has earned five DNFs, tied with Josh Berry and Michael McDowell for the most in NASCAR.\n\nKyle Larson finished 39th on Sunday after getting into a wreck late in the race. In his last nine starts, Larson has earned two wins, four top fives, six top 10s and three finishes of at least 30th. He's still the points leader, meaning he could win the regular season title for the second time in his career.\n\nRyan Blaney has been holding steady for the last five weeks and looks poised to make another run at the title. On Sunday, Blaney earned a P10 finish at the Chicago Street Race and has earned four top-10 finishes in the last five races.\n\nChase Elliott finished 21st on Sunday and has finished no better than 18th in his last three races. However, the 2020 Cup Series Champion has finished inside the top 20 in all of his races but one, and is one of the few drivers to not have a DNF.\n\nWith the win on Sunday, Bowman is in the power rankings after not being ranked last week. The Chicago Street Race is Bowman's first victory in 80 races and is tied with Bell and William Byron for second in top10s this year.\n\nChris Buescher is holding on to the final playoff spot after finishing 20th in Chicago and Bowman clinching a spot with the victory. He has yet to win a race this year, but In the last five races, Buescher has earned three top-five finishes.\n\nByron finished eighth at the Chicago Street Race, which was big for him after finishing 26th in New Hampshire and 19th in Nashville. Byron looks ready to win his first Cup Series title, winning three races this year including the Daytona 500.\n\nIt's a rough few weeks for Denny Hamlin who has won three races this season. He finished 30th at Chicago, making it the fifth consecutive race he's failed to score a top-10 result. Before that, Hamlin finished in the top five in five consecutive races.\n\nRicky Stenhouse Jr. makes his way into the power rankings after earning a P6 finish at Chicago. In the last four weeks, Stenhouse has earned three top-10 finishes, including a P5 finish at Iowa.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_jones@on3.com", "name": "Brian Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_M&M's_Fan_Appreciation_400", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 M&M's Fan Appreciation 400"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Bell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Blaney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Blaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McDowell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael McDowell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Stenhouse_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Stenhouse Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byron_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Byron (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Hamlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denny Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daytona 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Buescher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Buescher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/09142210/Alex-Bowman-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

(the Company or Bowman) (NASDAQ: BWMN), a national engineering services firm delivering infrastructure solutions to customers who own, develop and maintain the built environment, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the promotion of two senior executives and ratified a new four-year contract with its chief financial officer.\n\nThese promotions and the extension of Bruce's contract underscore our commitment to internal leadership development and to ensuring continuity and stability among our executive team, commented Gary Bowman, chairman and chief executive officer of Bowman Consulting. With respect to Mike and Dan, this is a natural evolution in our leadership structure, and I remain fully committed to an active operational role as chief executive officer.\n\nThe directors were unanimously in favor of retaining Bruce's services for another four years, commented Jim Laurito, chairman of Bowman's Compensation Committee. Bruce's contributions to Bowman have been exemplary, and we are pleased to be able to advance our strategic initiatives with continuity in the leadership of our financial and investor relations roles. From an operations perspective, there are several critical initiatives on the horizon, and we are reassured by the elevation of Dan to our senior executive team and by the knowledge that Bowman will continue to benefit from Mike's long-standing leadership and experience with our business as we advance toward our goals.\n\nMike Bruen has been with Bowman for over 25 years holding various leadership positions including serving as chief operating officer over the past 15 years. Mike serves as a member of the Company's Board of Directors. In this new role, Mike will oversee strategic planning, resource allocations, acquisition integration and business development.\n\nMike is our longest serving senior leader and he knows every aspect of our operation inside and out, added Bowman. Mike's leadership inspires everyone in the company to give their best effort every day for our clients. I am excited about this next chapter in Mike's career and the focus it will afford him in advancing our strategic growth initiatives.\n\nDan Swayze joined Bowman in 2022 as executive vice president of energy services. Since that time, Dan has grown within Bowman's leadership team to the role of division manager with primary oversight of the Company's transportation, MEP, and renewables practices. Prior to joining Bowman, Dan was chief operating officer at Onyx Renewable Partners L.P., a national renewable energy developer and financier established by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) in 2014. In this position, he led the engineering, procurement, construction and asset management divisions of the New York City-based company. During his nearly six years at Onyx, Swayze also managed the engineering division, where he supported the implementation of the design of renewable energy projects from development to construction. As chief operating officer at Bowman, Dan will be responsible for the oversight of all professional services operations.\n\nDan is the natural choice to succeed Mike as our chief operating officer, added Bowman. Dan has the breadth of knowledge and leadership acumen to take the reins and be effective immediately. He is a natural leader with the significant financial and managerial expertise needed to drive results in the COO role. I am excited about our future with Dan at the helm of our day-to-day operations.\n\nBruce Labovitz joined Bowman in 2013 and has been key to the Company's growth since that time. His leadership and strategic financial acumen were pivotal to the success of Bowman's initial public offering (IPO) in May 2021. Throughout his tenure, Labovitz has played a vital role in shaping the Company's financial strategies, successfully transitioned Bowman to a public reporting company, contributed to the leadership team across all disciplines, played an instrumental role in the execution and integration of multiple successful acquisitions which since the IPO have added over $150 million in revenue, led investor relations and corporate communications, and driven shareholder value through the addition of over $425 million in market capitalization since the IPO. Labovitz was recently recognized as the Public Company CFO of the Year by the Northern Virginia Technology Council for outstanding financial leadership and oversight.\n\nBruce is an invaluable member of our leadership team, added Bowman. His financial expertise and foresight have enabled our IPO and subsequent acquisition strategy and have secured our sound financial foundation allowing us to create value for our shareholders and employees. We are delighted that Bruce has committed to continuing to serve as our CFO. As we prepare to transition from emerging growth company status, his leadership will be crucial to successfully navigating this next phase of growth.\n\nAbout Bowman Consulting Group Ltd.\n\nHeadquartered in Reston, Virginia, Bowman is a national engineering services firm delivering infrastructure solutions to customers who own, develop and maintain the built environment.

Christopher Bell: Bell led 14 laps but suffered an accident three laps from the end and finished 37th in the Grant Park 165.\n\n\"I don't think I'm speaking out of turn,\" Bell said, \"when I say that Chase Briscoe helped Alex Bowman to the win by taking out Shane van Gisbergen on Lap 26. I guess you could say Chase ran out of talent. One thing Chase will never run out of is forehead.\"\n\n2. Tyler Reddick: Reddick, always strong on road courses, finished second in the Grant Park 165.\n\n\"I've won road course races before,\" Reddick said, \"so I was confident I could win at Chicago. I'm not a betting man, but I know someone who is, so he put his money where my mouth was.\"\n\n3. Ryan Blaney: Blaney finished 10th in a wet and wild Grant Park 165 on Chicago's street course.\n\n\"The Chicago Street Race is certainly unique,\" Blaney said. \"It's an endurance race and doesn't even know it.\"\n\n4. Denny Hamlin: Hamlin finished 30th in the Grant Park 165.\n\n\"I made contact with Ricky Stenhouse Jr.'s No. 47 car on Lap 30,\" Hamlin said. \"It was totally my fault. I locked up the brakes and ran right into Ricky. I hate it for Ricky. But I say chin up, Ricky. Things could be worse. You could still be dating Danica Patrick.\"\n\n5. Kyle Larson: Larson was running third on Lap 34 when he locked up his breaks into Turn 6 and went hard into the tire barrier. His car was too damaged to continue and he finished 39th.\n\n\"In a race defined by choosing between slick tires and wet weather tires,\" Larson said, \"my wet weather tires were too slick. Ironically, it was tires that stopped me. Just not the ones on my car.\"\n\n6. Chase Elliott: Elliott came home 21st in the Grant Park 165.\n\n\"The No. 9 car lost Hooter's sponsorship,\" Elliott said. \"They've been with us for so long, it really hurts to have to break that news. But I'm just glad I got it off my chest.\"\n\n7. Alex Bowman: Bowman snapped an 80-race winless drought with a win in the Grant Park 165, clinching a spot in the Playoffs.\n\n\"As I said after the race,\" Bowman said, \"I'm gonna drink so much bourbon to celebrate. And I really mean so much. So much that I'll pass out and maybe wake up 80 races later, just in time for my next win.\"\n\n8. Ty Gibbs: Gibbs started second and finished third in the Chicago Street Race.\n\n\"It was a crazy race,\" Gibbs said. \"You know it's a crazy race when a guy named 'Joey Hand' wins a stage. No one fears Joey Hand. Now, if it was 'Joey Hands,' and he was Italian, and in the mafia, then I would fear him.\"\n\n9. Ross Chastain: Chastain finished 22nd in the Chicago Street Race, his run for a top-10 finish derailed by a late slide into the tire barrier.\n\n\"I think NASCAR should definitely keep the Chicago Street Racing on the schedule,\" Chastain said. \"I think 99.9% of fans like it because the racing is exciting. And the other 0.01% just have a weird fetish in which they are excited by hearing 'Lake Shore Drive' mentioned 200 times in the span of two hours.\"\n\n10.

Bowman quelled the sponsor's fears, becoming the face of the brand in NASCAR, cultivating a tremendous relationship between the driver and the sponsor.\n\nSo much so that Ally's Chief Marketing Officer, Andrea Brimmer, shared that she was moved to tears when Bowman snapped his 80-race winless streak on Sunday evening.\n\n\"I'm literally in tears,\" Brimmer, Ally's Chief Marketing Officer, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"@Alex_Bowman has been battling so hard. This team so deserves it way to go @allyracing I love you guys!!!!\"\n\nAs you can tell, Bowman's relationship with Ally goes above and beyond the normal requirements for a driver and a sponsor. The No. 48's success is a true team effort, and their victory in Chicago was a tremendous feat.\n\nThe victory meant everything to Bowman himself, as well. The Hendrick Motorsports star has been subject to criticism due to his lack of trips to Victory Lane over the last two and a half years.\n\nPerhaps the floodgates will open for Bowman now, as he utilized an impressive drive to get the win in Chicago. Afterwards, while speaking with the media, the No. 48 wheelman fired back at critics who openly wondered whether he was worthy of his seat.\n\n\"Man, let me tell you about how great NASCAR is to us drivers. I got to my hotel room, there's a little box with my name on it, that had a bottle of bourbon in it, so that's in my bag. I'm pretty excited about that,\" Bowman explained, following the race. \"But I've got a couple bottles, that were bought early in 2022, that were like, 'The next win, we're going to drink these,' and they've been sitting on the counter way too f -- ing long.\n\n\"So yeah, everybody that said I couldn't win and don't deserve to be at Hendrick Motorsports and all that bulls -- , cheers to you.\"\n\nMoving forward, Alex Bowman, with Ally at his side, will be looking to secure all the playoff points he can to give the No. 48 team a shot at a title in 2024.

The Hendrick Motorsports driver snapped an 80-race drought by holding off a hard-charging Tyler Reddick in a rainy street race through the Windy City.\n\nBowman is the sixth driver to break a winless streak of at least 40 races in 2024, joining Brad Keselowski (110 races), Austin Cindric (85), Daniel Suarez (57), Joey Logano (49) and Chase Elliott (42).\n\nNext up is a trip to Pocono Raceway, NASCAR's only triangle-shaped track, with The Great American Getaway 400 scheduled for Sunday at 2:30 p.m. ET on USA Network. How does the field stack up heading into Pennsylvania? Here's our latest NASCAR power rankings:\n\nLast week: 3\n\nThe results haven't shown it the past two weeks, but no other driver is consistently as good as Bell right now. He finished 37th in Chicago after running 36th in Nashville - but that's not the full story, though. Bell led 14 laps on Sunday and was poised to chase down Bowman in the closing laps before getting collected in an accident outside of his control.\n\nLast week: 1\n\nLarson started on the pole but lost the lead on the opening lap and never regained the top spot. He later crashed hard in Stage 2 when he overshot a corner, which forced him to retire with a 39th-place finish. Larson still maintains a narrow lead in the points standings, but his spot atop the power rankings has been relinquished.\n\nLast week: 2\n\nFor the fifth straight race, Hamlin finished outside the top-10, marking his longest streak in two years. The Joe Gibbs Racing driver was 30th in Chicago after struggling in the rain. No one will be happier to arrive in Pocono than Hamlin, who has a record seven wins at the Tricky Triangle (including last year).\n\nLast week: 6\n\nReddick was oh-so-close to victory for the second consecutive week. This time, he was charging to the lead on faster tires before tapping the wall on the last lap and spoiling his hopes. The Air Jordan-sponsored driver still finished second in the city where his owner, Michael Jordan, made his name, but Reddick was again disappointed with himself after a driver error.\n\nLast week: 5\n\nAn up-and-down day ended on a high note with Blaney finishing 10th, marking his fourth top-10 in five races. Blaney has jumped to seventh in the points standings and is well within reach of fifth (14 points behind). The defending champion always looks forward to Pocono, where he scored his first Cup victory back in 2017.\n\nLast week: 4\n\nAfter 19 straight top-20s to start the season, Elliott suffered a season worst finish in Chicago of ... 21st. A last-corner collision with Suarez cost him a top-15 result. Elliott has finished outside the top-15 in three straight races, which is his worst stretch of the year.\n\nLast week: 8\n\nByron's eighth-place finish in Chicago was just his second top-10 in the last six races. Perhaps it will be a turning point for a team that has struggled after winning three of the first eight races this year. Pocono, where Byron led 60 laps last year, could be a track where his momentum continues to build.\n\nLast week: 7\n\nLike Elliott, Keselowski lost a handful of positions due to a last-lap incident. He finished 18th after scoring eight stage points. Keselowski is always strong in Pocono, as evidenced by his 10.9 average finish in 26 career starts.\n\nLast week: First four out\n\nWith his Hendrick teammates Larson, Elliott and Byron already locked into the playoffs with wins, Bowman had to be feeling the pressure. But it's quietly been a strong season for the 31-year-old Arizona native. Bowman already has more top-fives and top-10s than he had all of last season, and he's on pace for a career-best average finish (13.8).\n\nLast week: First four out\n\nGibbs' third-place finish snapped a streak of five straight finishes outside the top-10. The 21-year-old is still searching for that first career win, but Pocono could be where it happens. He finished fifth there last season after a 16th-place run in his Cup debut in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pocono Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Logano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Logano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Keselowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Keselowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gibbs_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gibbs Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2024/07/240709-alex-bowman-getty.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

But that didn't happen, as Reddick made contact with the wall in Turn 5 and lost all his momentum. Bowman increased his lead over Reddick and took it home to the start/finish line.\n\n23XI Racing co-owner Denny Hamlin said on Monday's \"Actions Detrimental\" podcast that Reddick was likely a victim of thinking of the remaining passing opportunities he would have to get past Bowman.\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" Hamlin said. \"I thought he was going to get there, especially as quickly as he was running him down. But yeah, fundamentals is the -- to finish first, you must first finish and so I think it's just he's gonna be tough on himself, but he's trying everything he can. He's probably thinking at that point he's got two more legitimate passing opportunities. He wasn't gonna be close enough off of Turn 5 where he hit the wall to get him into Turn 6.\n\n\"So, there was two more options, likely two options. One was going to be into Turn 7 over the bridge and the other was gonna be the very last corner because you would think there was another one in Turn 11 there, but the bottom was wet, and he was on slick tires and that probably wasn't gonna work unless he was willing to clean Alex out. So, I think that he probably panicked on counting down passing opportunities left and he was down to two. ... It would have been a fight for sure. The 48 would have likely blocked and tried to keep him in the wet but the 45 was coming so quickly, I just think he was gonna get there with a shot in the last few corners but obviously didn't work out.\"\n\nInstead of notching victory No. 2 this season, Reddick suffered heartbreak for the second consecutive race. He narrowly missed out on the win at Nashville last Sunday, failing to get past Joey Logano on the final lap.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm upset,\" Reddick said after the race. \"I was catching Alex by a large margin there. I don't know. That puzzles me. I clearly just screwed up. Trying to stay in the dry groove and I had more than enough room of dry groove. Yeah, I cut the wheel a little too hard -- just not focused enough, I guess.

Taking slick tires and full fuel at the end of Stage 2, the two Camry XSE drivers battled their way back up the running order to be within striking distance as time expired in the shortened race but were not close enough to capture victory.\n\nThe result marks the eighth top-five for Reddick, his third top-10 finish in a row, and the fifth top-five for Gibbs this season.\n\nRain was present throughout the day in downtown Chicago, forcing a hectic race where Gibbs, Reddick and Christopher Bell were at the front of the field most of Sunday afternoon. Gibbs and Bell kept out of trouble as other leaders wrecked in Stage 2 and led a combined 31 of the 58 laps run. Bell also pitted at the end of Stage 2 for slicks, but was caught in a late-race incident that ended in a 37th-place finish.\n\nThe NASCAR Cup Series heads to Pocono Raceway next Sunday, July 14 with race coverage beginning at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nDid you think you had enough to catch Alex Bowman for the win today?\n\n\"Yeah, I'm upset. I was catching Alex (Bowman) by a large margin there. I don't know. That puzzles me. I clearly just screwed up. Trying to stay in the dry groove and I had more than enough room of dry groove. Yeah, I cut the wheel a little too hard -- just not focused enough, I guess. I knew I was going to get to him and the earlier I could get to him the more options I would have, and it was going to get a little bit more slick off line beyond turn 8. Yeah, just didn't even give ourselves a shot to race him unfortunately. I hate it. Not what this Jordan Brand Toyota Camry is about and what this team is about. Just got to start capitalizing on these ones.\"\n\nYou looked fast out there. Did you think you had an opportunity to catch Alex Bowman?\n\n\"Until I wasn't. I got the opportunity to run him down. Just obviously couldn't get the job done. A clean lap was all I had to do and couldn't even do that.\"\n\nHow intense was the racing knowing you were racing to a time with the rain delay?\n\n\"The intensity really picked up. I didn't do a good job all day. I really didn't even have any business to be in contention to catch the 48 (Alex Bowman), but just I was very fortunate all day long. A lot of people wrecked around me. I don't think I really ever passed a sole to be honest. I just avoided the mess.\"\n\nCan you describe how the last 10 laps unfolded?\n\n\"Well, I mean the last 10 entirely there was a lot going on. The 20 (Christopher Bell) and the 54 (Ty Gibbs) were obviously ahead of us most of the day and the situation just played out to where they got collected in other people's nonsense. We were in a position to run down the 48 (Alex Bowman), it was going to be really close and had I not made the mistake - just crazy. Run all day long and know where my limits are and here at the end when it matters most I made the dumbest mistake.\"\n\nHow do weekends like this, third-place finishes in both races, feel?\n\n\"Yeah, we had a really good weekend and I'm thankful to have two great race cars that my team brought me. It's kind of rare, right, to have two great cars to make speed off of. You know, I feel like we were really fast in both races. We're just so close, super close both days. I mean, all I can ask for is a win, but we're right there. It's been really fun running the Cup Series. Just appreciative of what I get to do and thankful for what I get to do.\"\n\nWhat was it like racing in those conditions today?\n\n\"Yeah, it's really fun. I feel like it's kind of like a dirt track, honestly. Pick and choose your lines, see what lane is drying up and is faster. You have to look around, which makes it fun as we don't get to do that a lot. I like that and it takes a lot of racing awareness to do that, and it's fun to be looking and saying, 'that line is drying up' and you hit that line and I just gained two car-lengths on the guy in front of me, so it's really fun to do that.\"\n\nAbout Toyota\n\nToyota (NYSE:TM) has been a part of the cultural fabric in the U.S. for more than 65 years, and is committed to advancing sustainable, next-generation mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands, plus our nearly 1,500 dealerships.\n\nToyota directly employs more than 49,000 people in the U.S. who have contributed to the design, engineering, and assembly of more than 34 million cars and trucks at our nine manufacturing plants.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. isn't sure if a punishment is merited, but he was clear on one thing.\n\nDrivers need the freedom to respond like Bubba Wallace did.\n\n\"After the race, I'm OK if Bubba goes up there and hits the 48,\" Earnhardt Jr. said on the Dale Jr. Download podcast. \"And I'm OK if somebody goes after Chase (Elliott) or Chase goes after somebody. And if they want to fine them, that's fine. I don't care. I don't think the drivers mind too much. Five, $10, $15 grand.\n\n\"Don't take points away. Don't truly deter this, because this s*** is what racing's about.\"\n\nBubba Wallace was upset because earlier in the race Bowman had made a mistake that led to him spinning out Wallace. Wallace's car took hard contact, costing him a ton of track positioning and essentially ruining his day.\n\nBowman would later apologize and has even advocated that NASCAR not penalize Bubba Wallace for the post-race bump.\n\nCount Earnhardt Jr. as another who thinks a little tap here and there can be warranted and shouldn't be dealt with overly harshly.\n\n\"Now there is a line. There is a line where it's too egregious, too aggressive, too dangerous, and you've got to know as a driver where that's at and not to cross it,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"But these type of things for me is kind of in our DNA. It's like the gloves coming off at the hockey match and a couple of guys getting an opportunity to throw a few punches before the refs finally come in and go, 'All right, enough. The fans have seen enough.'\n\n\"I draw the line if the guy ends up backwards. That's over the line.\"\n\nBowman was no worse for the wear on Sunday after being bumped into the wall, other than perhaps being startled a bit. Even Bowman said the contact was well warranted after the earlier events in race.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. thinks there's a healthy element to the sport when a little contact is involved, and that's where the Bubba Wallace contact fell. Nonetheless, NASCAR did plan to review the contact for a possible penalty.\n\n\"That needs to be able to happen,\" he said. \"Those things like that, drivers need to be able to do those things, right or wrong.

A lot who were struggling to find the victory lane for over 40 races have finally managed to break their curses this year. And the latest among them is Hendrick Motorsports driver Alex Bowman, who emerged victorious at the end of the 58-lap race at the Chicago Street Course on Sunday.\n\nBowman was riding an 80-race winless streak which began after he won at Las Vegas in 2022. Chicago was the eighth win of his career and helped him fix a spot in the upcoming playoffs. Five other drivers have breached their droughts the same as him. Chase Elliott was on top of a 42-race winless streak when he reached the victory lane at Texas earlier in the season.\n\nHis bad luck began after Talladega in 2022 and went through a particularly agonizing 2023 in which he suffered major injuries. 2X Cup Series champion Joey Logano was another driver who won recently, at Nashville, to end a long streak. Since Atlanta last year, he had gone 49 races without a win. The breakthrough at the Music City came at a crucial point in the season for he was almost on the verge of missing out on the playoffs.\n\nTrackhouse Racing's Daniel Suarez made history in Atlanta in the second race of the 2024 season when he edged past Kyle Larson by 0.003 seconds. In doing so, he also secured a victory after a 57-race gap from his first Cup Series win, which was at Sonoma in 2022. Two more drivers, each with streaks longer than Bowman's, round up this list.\n\nTeam Penske driver Austin Cindric isn't someone who manages to reach the victory lane very often. However, he did do so at the World Wide Technology Raceway this year and broke an 85-race drought that began after he won the 2022 Daytona 500.

ARCA hotshots William Sawalich and Connor Zilisch are both 17, for reference.\n\nThe thought from here is that she'll at least have to prove herself again and be able to do what she couldn't already -- work herself upward via performance.\n\nAnd while we wish her well, nothing's guaranteed, and strong words on social media don't mean much compared to her last three seasons in NASCAR.\n\nThird gear\n\nBowman's victory alleviated his one-week stay on the playoff bubble and ratcheted up the pressure on those still hovering near it.\n\nParticularly Chris Buescher, who currently resides in 16th and would be the next man out should a driver behind him win over the final six events of the regular season. That includes a stop at Daytona where anything can happen.\n\nUp top, the gap between Hendrick Motorsports teammates Larson and Elliott is down to 11 points with Larson still holding the advantage.\n\nFourth gear\n\nOver the last four races at Pocono, Tyler Reddick has the best average finish (sixth). Denny Hamlin picked up his seventh win at the Tricky Triangle last year, breaking a tie with Jeff Gordon for the most all time.", "source": {"uri": "eu.news-journalonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Street_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Street Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailie_Deegan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hailie Deegan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Hocevar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carson Hocevar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Burton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Burton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Stenhouse_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Stenhouse Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byron_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Byron (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sawalich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Sawalich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Hamlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denny Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_International_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daytona International Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Buescher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Buescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pocono Raceway"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/08/USAT/74323161007-bowmancelebrates.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5104,2872,x0,y260&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Neither driver was ever in contention for the win and was racing for points. In the closing stages of the event, the Hendrick Motorsports star gave the Trackhouse Racing driver a nudge from behind. He then went past the Mexican-born driver who returned the favor. However, Suarez pushed a bit too hard, causing the #9 to spin around.\n\nThe two drivers were seen having a conversation after the event. Elliott seemed quite animated in the beginning but later calmed down. Suarez took the blame for the incident and the interaction ended. Both have won races this season and will be competing in the playoffs later this year.\n\n\"He pushed me a little bit and then I pushed him with all my intention and I ended up hitting him pretty good on the very last corner. My bad on that,\" the #99 driver said in a media interaction with Frontstretch. Elliott finished P21 while Suarez was P11.\n\nChase Elliott's teammate finally breaks his winless streak\n\nFollowing Shane van Gisbergen's DNF, it was anyone's race to win. But perhaps no one quite expected Alex Bowman to come up with the performance. Chicago marked Bowman's first victory on a road course. After the dismal performance of last season, this is a much-needed victory for the HMS star who has confirmed his place in the final 16.\n\n\"Man, I broke my back, I had a brain injury, and we've kind of sucked ever since. You kind of second guess if you are ever going to win a race again. Last one we won, we didn't really get to celebrate,\" - Bowman said as per USA Today.\n\nIndeed, after a winless season in 2023, this year was always going to be about redemption. Bowman was the last driver from Rick Hendrick's camp who has punched his ticket into the playoffs.\n\nThe Cup Series heads to Pocono Raceway this weekend. With his first win of the season secured Bowman would hope to continue his form at the superspeedway style track often referred to as 'The Tricky Triangle.'", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nilavro_ghosh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Nilavro Ghosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_220", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grant Park 220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackhouse_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trackhouse Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_van_Gisbergen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane van Gisbergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_track_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval track racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Hendrick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Hendrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pocono Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/f1480425-9gwf.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

Tyler Reddick (Last week No. 3) -- He has walked away the last two weeks frustrated with his performance despite placing in the top three. He finished second at Chicago but was frustrated with hitting the Turn 5 wall as he chased Alex Bowman on the final lap. Reddick has six top 10s in the last seven races. Four of those finishes in that stretch are top fives. He's getting closer to his second win of the season.\n\n2. Christopher Bell (1) -- Finishing races is key and his inability to do so the past two weeks is the reason he drops from the No. 1 spot. Bell led 14 laps in Chicago but was stuck outside the top 10 when others didn't pit late, electing to stay on wet weather tires after Bell and many of those at the front had stopped to put slick tires on. Bell couldn't get through the field quickly and was involved in an incident that damaged his car. He finished 37th a week after placing 36th. Still, in the last seven races, Bell has combined to lead 28.7 of the laps run.\n\n3. Kyle Larson (2) -- His brakes locked up and he went sliding into the Turn 6 tire barriers, damaging the front of his Chevrolet and ending his race in 39th. It continues his hot and cold streak. In his last nine starts, Larson has two wins, four top fives, six top 10s and three finishes of 30th or worse. That he remains the points leader despite missing the Coca-Cola 600 is remarkable but his advantage is only 11 points on teammate Chase Elliott and 23 points on Tyler Reddick, who is third in the points.\n\n4. Ryan Blaney (6) -- His 10th-place result gives him four top 10s in the last five races. Included in that streak is his Iowa win.\n\n5. Chase Elliott (4) -- Contact on the final lap dropped him to 21st at the finish -- the first time he's placed outside the top 20 this year. Elliott has finished no better than 18th in his last three races.\n\n6. Alex Bowman (NR) -- His Chicago win snaps an 80-race winless streak and gives him 11 top 10s this season. He is tied with Christopher Bell and William Byron for second in top 10s this season, two behind series leader Tyler Reddick.\n\n7. Chris Buescher (7) -- He holds the final playoff spot after finishing 20th and Alex Bowman winning to secure a playoff spot. Buescher has three top-five finishes in the last five races.\n\n8. William Byron (9) -- His eighth-place finish gives him four top 10s in the last eight races as he seeks to regain the success he had earlier in the season when he won three of the first eight races.\n\n9. Denny Hamlin (5) -- His 30th-place finish in Chicago marks the fifth consecutive race he's failed to score a top-10 result. He's finished 24th or worse in four of those five races.\n\n10. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (NR) -- His sixth-place finish gives him three top 10s in the last four races. In two of those races he finished in the top 10, he started 33rd or worse.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Bell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pocono Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Stenhouse_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Stenhouse Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byron_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Byron (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Hamlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denny Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Blaney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Blaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Buescher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Buescher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b9baac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3576x2012+0+169/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F17%2F59%2F036ac59342c9b6a0e3de3738278d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2160949645", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713642", "eventUri": "eng-9713642", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

However, the exact duration and itinerary remains flexible, a presidential official said Friday.\n\nThis marks Yoon's third vacation since his inauguration in May 2022.\n\nYoon, at a lunch meeting with presidential staffers Thursday, urged everyone to use their vacation days, but encouraged them to travel domestically, rather than going abroad, to help stimulate the local economy.\n\nOn the first day of his weeklong summer vacation in August last year, Yoon visited Gunsan in North Jeolla, where LS Group made large investments in the secondary battery industry. He later visited a traditional market in Geoje and the Jinhae Naval Base in South Gyeongsang and made a stop at the former presidential retreat Cheongnamdae in North Chungcheong.\n\nOfficials said that Yoon is likely to visit a military facility as well as traditional markets again this year during his time off.\n\nThe president's vacation is often dependent on the domestic situation.\n\nLast year, Yoon's vacation was cut short, with the president returning from break one day early to the Yongsan presidential office to inspect the status of the World Scout Jamboree. The event was plagued by a series of mishaps, including a heat wave and an incoming typhoon.\n\nDuring his summer vacation in 2022, Yoon took five days off, mostly staying at his private residence in Seocho-dong in southern Seoul.\n\nFor presidents, a vacation doesn't necessarily correlate with rest. Sometimes, it can come before important political decisions and announcements.\n\nAfter former President Kim Young-sam's summer vacation at the Cheongnamdae presidential villa, he returned to the Blue House in August 1993 and announced he would immediately implement a real-name financial transaction system, requiring that the real name of an individual or a legal entity be used in financial transactions, issued as a presidential emergency order.\n\nThis eventually has led to the evolution of a Cheongnamdae initiative, as it has become an important place where presidents go before making important decisions. Cheongnamdae, which opened to the public in 2003, literally translates to Blue House of the south.\n\nIt is also a site where major Cabinet reshuffles were decided before the president announced them after summer break. This was the case for former President Lee Myung-bak, who replaced the prime minister and nine ministers after taking a vacation there in August 2010 in his third year in office.\n\nFormer President Park Geun-hye returned from her first vacation in August 2013 and replaced five staff members, including her chief of staff, in a drastic reshuffle that took place less than six months after taking office.\n\nBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LS_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LS Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunsan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gunsan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gunsan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongsan_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Jeolla_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Jeolla Province"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Chungcheong_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Chungcheong Province"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Typhoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Gyeongsang_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Gyeongsang Province"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoje", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geoje"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geoje"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seocho-dong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seocho-dong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seocho-dong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung_Hee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Park Chung Hee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Young-sam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Young-sam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Myung-bak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/data/photo/2024/08/04/05b7c2ef-b88c-41e2-8ec5-51518afc58ee.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790770", "eventUri": "eng-9790770", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1993-08-", "textStart": 1949, "textEnd": 1960}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-08-", "textStart": 2708, "textEnd": 2719}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-08-", "textStart": 2817, "textEnd": 2828}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Courtesy of presidential office\n\nYoon expected to address economy-related issuesBy Kwak Yeon-soo\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol is expected to confront several significant challenges, including addressing the market rout and implementing the promised reforms, when returns from vacation.\n\nDuring his vacation, which began on Monday, Yoon has been visiting various regional areas outside Seoul to boost the local economy. He toured a traditional market in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province, and met with military personnel. The precise length of his vacation is flexible, the presidential office said.\n\nPresidential aides said Yoon has been using the time to rest and explore ideas that can help him tighten his grip on state affairs.\n\nThe most pressing concern awaiting the president upon his return is the state of the economy, which is significantly impacting public livelihoods.\n\nOn Monday, South Korea's benchmark KOSPI plunged 8.8 percent, marking its worst loss since the 2008 global financial crisis. This drop was driven by concerns over a potential U.S. economic downturn and increased tensions in the Middle East. As a result, trading curbs were activated for the first time in four years.\n\nWhile on vacation, Yoon called for close and proactive coordination among relevant institutions and instructed officials to implement measures swiftly.\n\n\"We urge the National Assembly to discuss abolishing the financial investment income tax as soon as possible as the tax could further depress the stock market,\" the presidential office said, Wednesday.\n\nThe financial investment income tax imposes a 20 percent charge on the total income derived from financial products, including stocks, bonds, funds, and derivatives, exceeding 50 million won ($36,335), with a higher rate of 25 percent applied to earnings surpassing 300 million won. The plan won bipartisan support in parliament in 2020, but was postponed until January next year due to strong objections from retail investors.\n\nIn the days and months ahead, Yoon will seek to complete reforms in education, labor, pension and healthcare and tackle the country's low birthrate.\n\nRep. Park Chan-dae, floor leader and acting chairman of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, speaks during a Supreme Council meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul, Wednesday. Yonhap\n\nYoon intends to hold a briefing on the state of the nation by the end of August. Although the exact topics have not been determined, the briefing will likely address the administration's major policy priorities, reform strategies, and the demographic challenges facing the country.\n\nThe president's to-do list also includes vetoing four broadcasting bills and reinstating the office of the first lady for Kim Keon Hee.\n\nYoon is widely anticipated to support the Cabinet's motion for parliamentary reconsideration of four bills designed to alter the governance structure of public broadcasters. If he endorses the motion, the bills will be returned to the Assembly for a revote.\n\nThe first lady made a surprise visit to a traditional market in Busan, Tuesday, to support local economy.\n\n\"Pollack roe is a representative food of Busan. Commercializing it by creating a brand character and developing related tourism products is a great way of revitalizing local economy,\" Kim said.\n\nOn Aug. 15, South Korea will celebrate National Liberation Day and Yoon is scheduled to grant special presidential pardons to politicians and business executives convicted of livelihood-related crimes. The pardons will be reviewed by a panel at the Ministry of Justice on Thursday and sent to a Cabinet meeting for deliberation next Tuesday before they are approved by Yoon.\n\nAlso gaining attention is Yoon's speech on that day, which will showcase the president's thoughts on state affairs, North Korea issues and Seoul-Tokyo relations.\n\nFurther complicating matters is a call from the opposition requesting a one-on-one meeting.\n\n\"We request President Yoon to meet with the opposition leader to deal with the economic crisis and discuss overcoming the political division together,\" Rep. Park Chan-dae, floor leader and acting chairman of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.\n\nThe remark came a day after Rep. Lee Jae-myung, former leader of DPK, expressed his wish to meet Yoon again. The two held first one-on-one meeting on April 29.\n\n\"The overall economy is currently in a dire state. I would like to meet and talk to Yoon about how we can overcome this situation and resolve parliament stalemate,\" Lee said.", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

(Yonhap)\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol is considering delivering a speech to the nation over a set of domestic reform agendas to address crises in the fields of education, labor, medicine, and population, as well as the public pension's sustainability later this month, according to the presidential office Monday.\n\nAccording to the presidential office, Yoon will make public remarks after he returns to his post from his summer vacation next week, and before the first regular session of the 22nd National Assembly kicks off on Sept. 2.\n\nPotentially drawing media attention are Yoon's plan for pension reform and the policy drive to address the record-low birth rate, amid the ruling bloc's confrontation with the opposition parties, which combined take a majority of seats at the National Assembly.\n\nIn the 21st National Assembly, the ruling bloc and the main opposition failed to reach an agreement on how much pension benefit an individual is to receive in proportion to his or her wage level, until its termination.\n\nRep. Park Ju-min of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea on July 29 called for the government's new pension reform proposal before September, as procrastination in the nation's pension reform will ramp up financial pressure on the young generation in what is almost a super-aging society.\n\nWith respect to the population crisis, the Yoon administration is tasked with the opposition-controlled parliament to push through the bill to establish a ministry dedicated to the nation's population planning, and have a deputy prime minister lead the ministry.\n\nYoon's remarks would mark the seventh to be delivered at an event, with the sole purpose of showing his attendance, since his inauguration.\n\nYoon last made his public remarks in June to announce that he had approved an exploratory drilling in the East Sea off South Korea's southeastern coast, hoping to explore potential oil and natural gas reserves. He also hosted a press conference in May, the second one since his inauguration in May 2022.\n\nHis last address to the nation took place in April, just ahead of the general election on April 10, to stress the need for medical reform to address the nation's looming physician shortage as thousands of trainee doctors walked out in a show of protest against the Yoon administration's plan for a medical school quota hike. He has made three addresses to the nation so far.\n\nAn official of the presidential office said on condition of anonymity that Yoon's upcoming remarks would align with his promise to hold a press conference quarterly, adding that the details on the timing and the topic of his public remarks have not been confirmed.\n\nIn the meantime, all eyes are on whether Yoon, who is currently on a weeklong vacation, will exercise his veto right over contentious bills as soon as they are tabled in a Cabinet meeting.\n\nThe bills include a 13 trillion-won ($9.58 billion) bill to dole out cash-equivalent coupons worth 250,000 won to every South Korean citizen universally, and four bills to curtail Yoon's power to nominate board members of South Korea's public broadcasters, among others.\n\nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo is set to preside over a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "koreaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Out of the classroom, out of the school and up a town road,\u201d said Ehrens, who remembers reaching the safe embrace of a neighbor as she fled in terror. She lives every day with a mix of gratitude that she survived and heartbreak that Lewis, 19 of her other classmates and six of their teachers never left that school that day. \u201cI will be graduating without some of my closest friends, the 20 students who had their lives taken from them,\u201d said Ehrens, just 17 years old and once again tasked with retelling the story of how she survived. Find their purpose She and other fellow survivors said Friday that it\u2019s difficult to speak about the massacre on Dec. 14, 2012, and the years of grief and fear that followed. It hurts to relive the events of that day over and over, but for them, it\u2019s important. Helping others understand the ripple effect of gun violence is bigger than them, bigger than Newtown. It\u2019s a painful necessity to resurface their own trauma in their fight for nationwide changes that they hope will prevent even more students from ending up like them. \u201cI will always be traumatized by what happened but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t grow from it,\u201d Ehrens said. \u201cAs a 17-year-old almost high school graduate, I can say that my life will never be the same. I will never be able to see my best friends again, I\u2019ll never not look from the exits in all the rooms, I\u2019ll never not be scared of the what ifs.\u201d Because her life changed forever that day, she has had the opportunity to tell her story to America\u2019s top lawmakers, to fight in Washington D.C. for life-saving gun laws and to speak out for the children who can no longer speak for themselves. Earlier in the day, Ehren\u2019s classmate Lilly Wasilnak, 17, said she looks at their choice to speak out as a way to honor those who cannot share their stories from that day. \u201cIn a very small small way you\u2019re giving them the voice they don\u2019t have, because they aren\u2019t able to speak,\u201d she said. \u201cEach of these kids, given the chance, would write you a novel.\u201d Fighting for future generations The graduating seniors who have spent the majority of their high school years marching, lobbying and advocating, plan to raise their voices louder and louder until they are heard. \u201cI won\u2019t stop until no one has to go through what I go through,\u201d said Ehrens. \u201cI will not stop pushing our lawmakers to make the necessary changes we need to keep our children and people safe, I want to live in a nation that values children over guns.\u201d Standing beside Ehrens, Grace Fischer stepped up to tell her story. \u201cEleven-and-a-half years ago, I was sitting in my classroom going over the weather and calendar with my class when the loud banging of an AR-15 boomed through the school,\u201d Fischer recalled. Her teacher, she said, told them it was just noise from construction work. But the shots continued, getting closer and louder. \u201cI was sheltered away in the cubbies of my first grade classroom as I listened to the sound of my close friends being murdered just outside the walls,\u201d Fischer said. In her 6-year-old mind, not knowing what a gun sounded like, she assumed the noise was coming from pots and pans in the cafeteria. \u201cI never would have imagined when I left school that day I was leaving behind 20 of my friends and six heroic teachers.\u201d Fischer said that as graduation gets closer and closer, her senior year has been mixed with emotions. She wishes her 20 classmates were with her, but she is thankful for the Junior Newtown Action Alliance. which gives her a platform to speak out against gun violence and to push for assault weapons bans, better mental health care, safe storage laws and safer schools not only in her hometown but in the offices on Capitol Hill in Washington and most recently, in the White House. \u201cIt takes courage to stand up here and tell my story, but I and other survivors will not stop until change is made,\u201d she said. \u201cI will stand up here until there are no more school shootings and senseless gun violence because simply living should be a given in this country.\u201d Fisher said she fights for the memory of her classmates and for the children in generations to come who will someday go to school and hope to be safe there. \u201cWe will not let the government fail us over and over again. I do not want future kids of America to have to be scared in a classroom,\u201d said Fischer. \u201cGuns should not be the number one killer of children and teens in America. We want change and we will make it happen.\u201d Driven by fear When Molly Zatlukal, co-chair of Junior Newtown Action Alliance was applying to colleges, she chose to center part of her application essay on the gun violence prevention advocacy work she has done with the foundation. Zatlukal wrote that she is often called fearless, when she, in fact, feels full of fear. \u201cIn all honesty, I feel that fear actually controls a lot of my life,\u201d she said at Friday\u2019s rally, listing off a few of her fears, like bees. But one fear has dominated her life and her work: Guns. She said many people who take part in gun violence prevention advocacy are fearful of the reaction to their work. They may be hesitant to get involved because they are scared of public speaking or backlash. All those fears are valid, she said, but there\u2019s one fear that drives her and her fellow advocates to raise their voices louder and louder. \u201cSomething that I\u2019m sure we are all more afraid of is gun violence,\u201d Zatlukal said. \u201cThe truth is, no one in this movement is fearless. Fear is our drive.\u201d The senior said that in her college essay she wrote: \u201cThe concept of being fearless, of being devoid of fear, is illusionary. True courage is how we act despite our fear.\u201d Zatlukal said Friday that when faced with fear, there is always a choice. \u201cIn this case, evading the topic of gun violence at all costs or confronting it head on,\u201d she said. \u201cI encourage everyone to choose the second one.\u201d As younger students take over the work at the Junior Newtown Action Alliance, Zatlukal encouraged them to embrace their fear and vulnerability, \u201cbecause it can be your most powerful and persuasive tool.\u201d Two of those young leaders who will take charge of the group next year also spoke at Friday\u2019s rally, sharing their stories of trauma and their hopes for a better future. Cali Taylor, a sophomore at Newtown High School, was 4 years old when the shooting happened. Her mom was a second grade teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012. \u201cShe was there at the time of the shooting and by chance she and her students were able to walk out of that building,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cMake no mistake their lives were changed forever.\u201d Her life has never been the same, either. Taylor said she remembers a day in second grade when she first understood what had happened in the school, understood that it was a gunman who killed her friends and her mothers\u2019 colleagues. \u201cNo child should have to hear about others being murdered while in school by a man with a gun, a weapon that holds the capacity to rob the lives of such innocent children,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not accept the fact that kids do not feel safe in school, school should be one of the safest places, a place where you\u2019re free to learn and grow.\u201d Fellow future leader Saige Koellmer said she was a 5-year-old getting ready for afternoon kindergarten when the sounds of sirens surrounded their home and helicopters buzzed over their neighborhood. Koellmer was supposed to be headed to Sandy Hook Elementary School that afternoon but was still home safe. Her cousin, Jessica Rekos, was already at school, sending their family into a tailspin as they searched for signs she was safe. Rekos was one of the 20 students who were killed. \u201cThat day she was unaccounted for, and her life was tragically taken at the age of 6 years old,\u201d said Koellmer. \u201cMy play date buddy, my best friend, my cousin all in one, stripped away from me. \u201c The fear of reliving that, of losing another person to gun violence, stays with her every day. \u201cI have to live with knowing that after the murder of all my innocent classmates and teachers, school shootings never stopped,\u201d said Koellmer. \u201cKnowing that a school shooting, or any shooting, could happen at any second, anywhere. That I could lose my life or yet another person that I cherish.\u201d Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan was killed in the mass shooting, spoke at the rally about how the tragedy in Newtown changed the world. The reverberations were global following the tragedy, she said, and \u201cwhat happened in Sandy Hook helped create momentum behind\u201d a whole new phase of gun violence prevention. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting it in Newtown, and yet these acts of violence are something that some kids deal with every day,\u201d said Hockley. Through her work at Sandy Hook Promise, Hockley said she has seen advocates push for so many solutions to gun violence problems from small acts of kindness to open, compassionate conversations to safe storage laws and extreme risk protection orders. She remains hopeful that those conversations and changes will continue and that those impacted by the tragedy in their own town will keep saving lives across the globe. Rev. Sam Saylor of Hartford joined the speakers at Friday\u2019s rally. When his son and, later, his granddaughter were gunned down in urban areas of the state riddled with gun violence, he said he felt like no one in Connecticut was looking at them or listening to their anguish. \u201cAnd then Newtown happened,\u201d he said. \u201cTwenty little babies were butchered in one day in a place where safety was ensured.\u201d The grief, Saylor said, must have been insurmountable. \u201cAnd yet you did not fall down,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got up and you united.\u201d Saylor encouraged everyone at Friday\u2019s rally to continue standing united, to share their stories and advocate for life-saving change and to protect young people from having their lives cut far too short by gun violence like the 20 first graders at Sandy Hook, like his 12-year-old granddaughter and his 20-year-old son. \u201cIt\u2019s a joy to be 13 and 14. It\u2019s a joy to be 21 and 22,\u201d Saylor said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for, the joy of our children.\u201d", "summary": "Graduating members of Junior Newtown Action Alliance, many of them Sandy Hook survivors. promised to never stop fighting for change during a rally on National Gun Violence Awareness Day.", "url": "https://www.courant.com/2024/06/08/sandy-hook-survivors-honor-fallen-classmates-with-vow-to-keep-advocating-for-gun-violence-prevention/", "image": "https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thc-l-newtown1.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:29:55", "author": "Taylor Hartz", "authors": ["Taylor Hartz"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.168}

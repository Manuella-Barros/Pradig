In a letter to the chairman of Ward 9, Opoji in Esan Central Local Government Area, dated June 6th 2024, Inegbeneki said certain things have been occuring in his local government area lately that did not go down well with his core political values. Stating that the APC needed to be repositioned in the state, Inegbeneki said his resignation from the party was in the interest of his Edo Central Senatorial District. The letter reads: \u201cThere comes a time in the life of every man when some hard decisions must be taken not only in one\u2019s interest but in the general interest of his People. This is one of such moments. \u201cAfter 25 years as an active, financial and dedicated grassroots politician in Edo State. Also as one of the founding fathers of the All Progressives Congress (APC)in Edo State, I believe that I have contributed my quota to the growth of the party in my Ward, Local Government Area, Senatorial district, State and our country, Nigeria. \u201cHowever, some recent developments in the party in my LGA and State conflict with my core principles and values. This has led me to do a serious evaluation of my political future in Edo State and decide on the way forward. \u201cAfter due consultations with my family, friends and political associates, I wish to formally inform you of my decision to resign my membership of the All Progressives Congress(APC)and my role as the State Vice Chairman. It is a hard decision but it is the best in the interest of the good people of my Senatorial district. \u201cI wish to formally thank the party for availing me of the platform upon which I was elected the current party state Vice Chairman. However a lot needs to be done to reposition the party in Edo State. \u201cI thank all my teeming supporters and followers for their support and loyalty, despite the challenges. Now, it is time to chart a new course for the good of all. \u201cTo all my friends, brothers and sisters in the All Progressives Congress(APC),I wish you well and wish to let you know that we still remain what we are. I cherish our relationship, and nothing can change it.\"", "summary": "<img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/APC-Flag1-1280x720-1.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/APC-Flag1-1280x720-1.png 1280w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/APC-Flag1-1280x720-1-300x169.png 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/APC-Flag1-1280x720-1-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><p>The Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has suffered a setback as its Edo Central Vice Chairman, Francis Inegbeneki, resigned his membership of the party.

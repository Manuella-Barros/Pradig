Security Council voted unanimously Friday to end the U.N. political mission in Iraq established in 2003 following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein to coordinate post-conflict humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, and to help restore a representative government in the country.\n\nThe Iraqi government asked the counci l in a May 8 letter to wrap up the mission by the end of 2025 and that\u00b4s what the resolution does: It extends the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, known as UNAMI, for a final 19 months until Dec. 31, 2025 when all its work will cease.\n\nThe U.S.-sponsored resolution asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to prepare \"a transition and liquidation plan\" in consultation with the Iraqi government by Dec. 31, 2024 so UNAMI can start transferring its tasks and withdrawing staff and assets.\n\nThe council said it supports Iraq\u00b4s continuing stabilization efforts including its ongoing fight against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida extremists and their affiliates.\n\nIn 2014, the Islamic State group declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria and attracted tens of thousands of supporters from around the world. The extremists were defeated by a U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria in 2019, but its sleeper cells remain in both countries.\n\nThe council\u00b4s action came as Iraq is also seeking to wind down the military coalition formed to fight the IS. The roughly 2,500 U.S. troops are scattered around the country, largely in military installations in Baghdad and in the north. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has contended that the Iraqi security forces are capable of dealing with the remaining IS cells in the country and the coalition\u00b4s presence is no longer needed.\n\nThe resolution adopted Friday to close the UNAMI mission expresses support for Iraq\u00b4s reform efforts aimed at fighting corruption, respecting and protecting human rights, delivering essential services to its people, creating jobs and diversifying the economy.\n\nIt asks the secretary-general to streamline UNAMI\u00b4s tasks ahead of the mission\u00b4s closure to focus on providing advice, support and technical assistance to the government to strengthen preparations for free elections, including for the federal Parliament and for the Parliament in the Kurdistan region.\n\nIt also authorizes UNAMI to facilitate progress toward finally resolving outstanding issues between Iraq and Kuwait, stemming from Saddam Hussein\u00b4s invasion of its smaller neighbor in August 1990.\n\nIn addition, the resolution says UNAMI should help with the return of internally displaced Iraqis and those in Syria, with providing health care and other services and with economic development. And it also authorizes the mission to \"promote accountability and the protection of human rights, and judicial and legal reform.\"\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood welcomed the resolution\u00b4s unanimous adoption and plans for an orderly wind down of UNAMI.\n\n\"We all recognize that Iraq has changed dramatically in recent years and UNAMI\u00b4s mission needed to be realigned as part of our commitment to fostering a secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" he told the council.\n\nRussia\u00b4s deputy U.N. ambassador Anna Evstigneeva stressed that what was important for Moscow in voting for the resolution was that the United States took into account the priorities Iraq wanted UNAMI to focus on in its final months.\n\n\"We are convinced that in the 20 years since its establishment UNAMI has fully realized its potential to assist in the restoration of Iraqi statehood and that the people of Iraq are now ready to assume full responsibility for the country\u00b4s political future,\" she said. \"We express our firm support for Iraq sovereignty and oppose any interference in the country\u00b4s internal affairs.

However, the United States did not immediately back this move.\n\nAbbas Kadhim Al-Fatlawi, Iraq's Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, reiterated Iraq's request for the UN to terminate its political mission by the end of 2025, stating that \"the mission has achieved its objectives.\"\n\nOn May 21, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani formally requested in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the UN conclude its assistance mission to Iraq, UNAMI, by December 31, 2025.\n\nHe indicated that the mission's remaining efforts this year should focus solely on finalizing work related to economic reform, service provision, sustainable development, climate change, and other developmental aspects.\n\nEstablished in 2003 under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1500, at the request of the Iraqi government, the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) role expanded significantly in 2007 under Resolution 1770.\n\nAt the outset of its operations in Iraq, the Mission faced a tragic incident in August 2003 when a terrorist bombing targeted its headquarters at Al-Qanat Hotel in Baghdad.\n\nThe attack destroyed the hotel, claiming the lives of 23 staff members, including the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the United Nations, Sergio Vieira de Mello.\n\nThe Mission, headquartered in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, is also tasked with collaborating with government partners and civil society to coordinate the humanitarian and development initiatives of UN Agencies, Funds, and Programmes.\n\nThe UN Iraq explained that while UNAMI doesn't directly implement humanitarian and development programs, it amplifies the importance of these issues in Iraq.

The extremists were defeated by a US-led military coalition in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria in 2019, but its sleeper cells remain in both countries.\n\nThe council's action came as Iraq is also seeking to wind down the military coalition formed to fight the IS. The roughly 2,500 U.S. troops are scattered around the country, largely in military installations in Baghdad and in the north. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has contended that the Iraqi security forces are capable of dealing with the remaining IS cells in the country and the coalition's presence is no longer needed.\n\nThe resolution adopted Friday to close the UNAMI mission expresses support for Iraq's reform efforts aimed at fighting corruption, respecting and protecting human rights, delivering essential services to its people, creating jobs and diversifying the economy.\n\nIt asks the secretary-general to streamline UNAMI's tasks ahead of the mission's closure to focus on providing advice, support and technical assistance to the government to strengthen preparations for free elections, including for the federal Parliament and for the Parliament in the Kurdistan region.\n\nIt also authorizes UNAMI to facilitate progress toward finally resolving outstanding issues between Iraq and Kuwait, stemming from Saddam Hussein's invasion of its smaller neighbor in August 1990.\n\nIn addition, the resolution says UNAMI should help with the return of internally displaced Iraqis and those in Syria, with providing health care and other services and with economic development. And it also authorizes the mission to \"promote accountability and the protection of human rights, and judicial and legal reform.\"\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood welcomed the resolution's unanimous adoption and plans for an orderly wind down of UNAMI.\n\n\"We all recognize that Iraq has changed dramatically in recent years and UNAMI's mission needed to be realigned as part of our commitment to fostering a secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" he told the council.\n\nRussia's deputy U.N. ambassador Anna Evstigneeva stressed that what was important for Moscow in voting for the resolution was that the United States took into account the priorities Iraq wanted UNAMI to focus on in its final months.\n\n\"We are convinced that in the 20 years since its establishment UNAMI has fully realized its potential to assist in the restoration of Iraqi statehood and that the people of Iraq are now ready to assume full responsibility for the country's political future,\" she said. \"We express our firm support for Iraq sovereignty and oppose any interference in the country's internal affairs.
